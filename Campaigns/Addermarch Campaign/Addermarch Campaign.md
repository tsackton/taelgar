The Addermarch Campaign tells the story of [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], for now known as the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]], three adventurers blown together by chance. They met on the road to [[Roscombe]], a village in [[Addermarch]], all seeking to join the service of [[Caradoc]], a mysterious alchemist and recluse. 

The game begins in the 2nd year of the reign of [[Robert I]] of [[Sembara]], recorded as the year 1715 after the founding of Drankor (1715 DR) by scholars, at a time of uncertainty in the [[Western Green Sea]]. Less than two years ago, Queen [[Cece I]] of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]], ally to [[Addermarch]], and victor against the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] in the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]], died. With her, seemingly, 65 years of peace and prosperity also died, for since [[Robert I]] took the throne, [[Sembara]] has been beset by troubles. 

In [[Addermarch]], thought, the worries of distant kings and queens often seem remote, and it is the late snows and cold spring that are on the minds of  farmers, hoping for a good apple crop this year.
