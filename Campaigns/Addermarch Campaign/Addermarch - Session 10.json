  "shortSummary": "Leaving Zibzig's lair, the party battles darkmantles over a subterranean pool to harvest more uligium, then escapes past an ogre and wolf and returns toward Roscombe.",
  "longSummary": "After breakfast with kobold inventor Zibzig Sparkscale, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan accept his directions to another uligium cache deeper in the West Stonewolds Caves, along with a route back to the surface. Following his guidance to a cavern split by a chasm and a still pool, they are plunged into magical darkness as four darkmantles drop from the ceiling; Yvan's wild surges of fire, Fazoth's lightning guided by his pseudodragon's blindsight, and Drou's persistence eventually shatter the attackers. With energies still crackling, Yvan heats a glass bottle to lure fresh uligium from the tunnel walls. Guided back toward the entrance, they confront the ogre and wolf sentries but pacify them with Fazoth's Calm Emotions long enough to slip past, then trek eastward, camping in farmland before reaching Brantor to deliver their four vials of uligium and continuing on to Roscombe.",
