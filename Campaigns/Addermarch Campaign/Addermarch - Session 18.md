%% RAW notes

fight skeletons in officer's quarters. realize several are immune to fire after Yvan attempts a classic fire spell to lead off. constrictor snake and fey take the bulk of the hits - constrictor snake almost dies, and fey is also killed. managing exploding skeletons is tricky. but with the summons soaking up the bulk of the hits the rest of the party survives nicely finishing them off mostly with cantrips. 

after battle, short rest in the officer's quarters. search the quarters and attached mess.
