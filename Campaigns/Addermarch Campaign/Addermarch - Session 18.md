At [[Serethwyn Tor]], the party clears the officer's barracks and pushes into the mine, where an intentional cave-in blocks the main tunnel and serpentine undead guard the way.

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1715-05-26), **late afternoon**: In the officer's barracks, the party fights skeletons and takes a brief rest, before proceeding into the mines. In the mines, they find a massive cave-in and fight skeletons and serpentine wights; a unicorn appears amid Yvan's wild magic and helps end the battle.
- (DR:: 1715-05-27), **morning**: The party wakes after a long rest in the upper mine chambers.

## Cast of Characters

- **[[Yvan Greenrabbit]]** - Halfling sorcerer whose wild magic conjures a unicorn in the mine fight.
- **[[Drou]]** - Elven bard-monk who relies on the Staff of the Python and uses _Hypnotic Pattern_ to disable the undead.
- **[[Fazoth de Brune]]** - Warlock whose scout and summons take the brunt of the fighting in cramped quarters.
- **[[Duncan of Haldrenn]]** - Missing shepherd; signs of his camp and footprints point to his passage through the mine.
- **Summoned unicorn** - Appears during the mine battle and helps destroy undead; indicates the upper chambers are safe to rest in.
- **Skeletons of Serethwyn Tor** - Barracks defenders whose deaths trigger dangerous explosions.
- **Serpentine wights** - Undead guardians encountered in the mine near the cave-in.

## Places

- **[[Serethwyn Tor]]** - Ruined hill-fort where the party battles through the barracks and searches the mine entrance.
- **Serethwyn Tor mine** - Upper mine tunnels leading to a massive cave-in that blocks the main passage.

## Narrative

### Wednesday, May 26th, 2 Robert I

We begin in the late afternoon, as the party fights a group of skeletons in the officer's barracks. Several of them are immune to fire, which Yvan realizes after attempting to hit them with a sorcerous burst. Though this initially confounds Yvan's strategy, with Drou's giant constrictor snake and Fazoth's fey ally, the party avoids taking many hits from the skeletons. However, the snake is badly wounded in the fight, as skeletons keep exploding in shards of fire or bone when they die, though Drou is able to turn it back into a staff before it dies. 

After a quick search reveals no more enemies (along with signs of ancient fire damage, and some possible bodies of Rangers buried under collapsed stone), the party takes a breather. After a quick rest, and a short walk through the barracks uncovers nothing more interesting than [[avatus-symbol-sketch.png|Avatus' symbol]] on some gear, the party enters the mine area. Here, they quickly explore a work shed, finding what is probably Duncan's camp, before heading into the mine. 

The mine cuts horizontally into the hill for a few hundred feet before it dead-ends in a massive cave-in. In the cave-in chamber, the party encounters skeletons and serpentine wights. Drou's _Hypnotic Pattern_ puts most of them to sleep as the battle opens, and Yvan's wild magic surge summons a unicorn, who makes quick work of the undead. Though the unicorn quickly departs, she shares that she can sense no more undead in these upper mine chambers, and suggests this would be a safe place to rest. 

The party takes advantage of this advice, and our session ends the next morning. 

### Thursday, May 27th, 2 Robert I

The party wakes after a long rest in the mine, with signs that the cave-in was intentional and with footprints suggesting another entrance somewhere beyond the blockage.

%% RAW notes

fight skeletons in officer's quarters. realize several are immune to fire after Yvan attempts a classic fire spell to lead off. constrictor snake and fey take the bulk of the hits - constrictor snake almost dies, and fey is also killed. managing exploding skeletons is tricky. but with the summons soaking up the bulk of the hits the rest of the party survives nicely finishing them off mostly with cantrips. 

after battle, short rest in the officer's quarters. search the quarters and attached mess. more evidence of fire damage - fireball maybe. also find a few crushed bodies (under rubble) that don't seem to be skeletons / animated, perhaps rangers who couldn't be retrieved. but no treasure.

walk through barracks - find avatus symbol on some rusting gear but nothing else of interest. 

find presumably duncan's camp in the work shed outside the mine entrance. don't search extensively though. 

enter mine. follow main path, until reach major blockage. pseudodragon scouts ahead, killed by serpentine wights. drou uses hypnotic pattern to disable nearly all of the enemies. fazoth summons another fey ally - though pseudodragon is killed. fight is in tight quarters in a narrow passage, which makes positioning tricky. yvan casts scorching ray and ends up summoning a unicorn, who makes quick work of the enemy, healing the party in the process. before the unicorn leaves, she uses detect good and evil to tell the party this area  of the mine is safe to rest in. 

obvious signs after the battle that the cave-in was intentional, and recent signs of footprints (duncan's presumably) going both into and out of the mine here - must have found another entrance. 

session ends the next morning, in the mine, after a long rest.
