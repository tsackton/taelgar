  "shortSummary": "Research in Roscombe and a visit to the ranger Arvanko uncovers information ancient sites from the wars with Avatus sites and points the party toward the ruined hill-fort of Serethwyn Tor.",
  "longSummary": "Waking at The Traveler's Rest in Roscombe, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan spend several days tracing the trail of Geoffrey, the mysterious stranger tied to Duncan’s cursed battle axe. Colette du Bois and innkeeper Bertrand recall Geoffrey’s solitary stay, his long ranging trips into the high moors, and his final departure in March laden with climbing gear, while Emma Cole describes a map covered in strange notes and the word 'Avatus' with circled points in the northern mountains. Over lunch, Lady Elowen Duval’s notes lead them to Master Ernault, an elderly scholar who remembers Geoffrey as rude and arrogant but points the party toward an old record noting Serethwyn Tor—a hill-fort destroyed and ordered sealed by rangers—as a likely resting place for ancient Avatus relics. Traveling to Caradoc’s cottage, the heroes collect magic items, commission more Trueflame to destroy the battle axe, and are directed to Arvanko the Stoneborn, a prickly ranger crafting a stone monument to fallen comrades, who confirms Serethwyn Tor’s location, speaks of a lost register of cursed serpentine weapons, and gifts them a Drankorian sending stone to report back once they reach the fort. The session ends as they retrieve their Trueflame from Caradoc and set out along the road toward Serethwyn Tor, camping en route.",
