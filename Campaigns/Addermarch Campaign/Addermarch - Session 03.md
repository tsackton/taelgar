## Narrative
### Sunday, May 2nd, 2 Robert I

We begin in the morning at [[The Traveler's Rest]] in [[Roscombe]]. As [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] eat breakfast, they receive two letters. [[Letter from Owen Tavish|One]] is from [[Owen Tavish]], the priest of [[The Sibyl]]; the [[Letter from Elowen Duval|other]], sealed with green wax, imprinted with the Duval seal, showing a stylized valley between two mountains with an oak tree in the middle, is from [[Elowen Duval]].

During the day, the party rests and relaxes. Sunday is a market day, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] goes to the market to find a buyer for the ancient coins he found in [[Torvaine Watch]]. Otherwise, the day passes quietly until the evening, when [[Caradoc]] arrives to meet the party. 

[[Caradoc]] proposes a simple mission as test of the party's skills: travel to a nearby area where a cockatrice is thought to lair, kill it, and bring back a cockatrice gizzard, which is a valuable ingredient in several potion recipes.  
### Monday, May 3rd, 2 Robert I

[[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] depart [[Roscombe]] in the morning, heading west through open fields and pastures, towards the hills. Reaching a rocky outcropping indicated as a landmark by [[Caradoc]], the party navigates easily through the forest, guided by [[Drou]], and sees both the cockatrice cave and a [[Kilrath Standing Stones|stone circle]] in the dell below. Faint voices can be heard echoing from the stone circle, and warnings written in an ancient tongue, but the party moves quickly past into the cave. 

Soon, the party finds a statue of a dwarf with its arms broken off, a rotted pouch at its feet hinting at the possessions of a treasure hunter, including a [[Dwarf Map from Cockatrice Cave.jpg|strange map]]. Exploring the passages that lead from this chamber, they encounter a dead end first, where a shadow attempts to ambush them, thwarted by perceptive [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], who notices the shadow moving. As the skeleton on the ground rises up to attack, [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] taunts it with Vicious Mockery, causing it to miss, while [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] destroys the shadow with a burst of fire. 

Continuing to explore the cave, the party finds the main cavern of the cockatrice, discovering that it has apparently made its lair in a place with a strange -- and not functioning -- fey gate. [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] storms into the room with a booming voice and flashing eyes, frightening the cockatrice, and then it is hit, in quick succession, with multiple witch bolts from [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], as well as haunting whispers from [[Drou]], while the cockatrice teleports around the room. It eventually retreats and drinks some healing water, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] kills it with his witch bolt while [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] goes scouting and discovers another room full of cockatrice hatchlings and eggs. The hatchlings pose little challenge with the adult dead, and the party is able to collect the eggs, while also noticing a particularly realistic statue of a shepherd boy in the room. 

[[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] explore, looking for the source of the sound of a waterfall, and are dazed and surprised by the sudden appearance of a hypnotic pattern on the cavern ceiling. Coming to in a minute, they find themselves bound with watery cords as a water nymph, a naiad speaks to them, yelling about corruption and evil mortals and insisting they drink the water and clean the water and deal with it. As [[Drou]] approaches, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] dives to the bottom of the pool, retrieving some treasure while swimming through a strange patch of red algae. The naiad does not calm down until [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] freezes the algae, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] uses mage hand to drop it in the boiling mud near the cockatrice eggs. 

Sorting through the treasure recovered from the bottom of the naiad's pool, the party fines some jewelry clearly belonging to [[Elowen Duval]], or at least her family; and a golden holy symbol of [[The Sibyl]] of a strange design. After speaking briefly with the naiad about fey, the party returns to the cockatrice lair and destroys the fey gate by melting the crystal keeping it from fully closing with acid from [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]]'s sorcerous burst.

[[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] also speaks to the naiad about the fey, learning that the [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]] drove her here, and that he lurks in the [[Darkwood]] to the south. In the [[Feywild]], the [[Darkwood]] is known as Duskmire, and is a nasty, terrible place.

After having brought everything outside, the party departs for [[Roscombe]], spending the night on the road. 

### Tuesday, May 4th, 2 Robert I

The party detours to [[Brantor]], to give the cockatrice gizzard to [[Caradoc]], and then returns to [[Roscombe]], where they give [[Elowen Duval]] back the treasure they found, learning it was stolen by a bandit two years ago. Lady Duval pays them the still-outstanding bounty for the capture or death of the bandit, and wishes them luck. We end that evening, back at [[the Traveler's Rest]].
