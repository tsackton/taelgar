Research in Roscombe and a visit to the ranger [[Arvanko]] uncovers information about ancient sites from the wars with [[Avatus]] and points the party toward the ruined hill-fort of [[Serethwyn Tor]]. 

## Timeline

- (DR:: 1715-05-22), morning: At [[The Traveler's Rest]] in [[Roscombe]], the party interviews [[Colette du Bois]], innkeeper [[Bertrand LeBlanc]], and chambermaid [[Emma Cole]] about Geoffrey, the dead stranger tied to Duncan’s axe, then meets [[Elowen Duval]] for lunch and is directed to scholar [[Ernault]] in the keep’s archives.
- (DR:: 1715-05-22), afternoon: Traveling to [[Caradoc]]’s cottage near [[Brantor]], the party collects magic items, commissions more [[Trueflame]] to destroy the cursed battle axe, and departs for  [[Arvanko]]'s homestead. 
- (DR:: 1715-05-23): Reaching [[Arvanko]]’s hill-country homestead, the heroes earn his trust and learn the location of the ruined hill-fort of [[Serethwyn Tor]], then depart to return to Caradoc's, camping on the return journey. 
- (DR:: 1715-05-24): The party arrives back at [[Caradoc]]’s cottage by midday, retrieves their prepared Trueflame, and sets out along the road toward Serethwyn Tor. 

## Cast of Characters

- **[[Yvan Greenrabbit]]** — Halfling sorcerer whose charm and questions help coax details from wary locals and the taciturn ranger Arvanko.
- **[[Drou]]** — Elven bard-monk, steadily piecing together the paper trail from Haldrenn to Roscombe’s archives and the rangers’ monuments.
- **[[Fazoth de Brune]]** — Human warlock-alchemist, focused on acquiring the magic needed to end the battle axe’s curse and understanding Avatus-era history.
- **[[Colette du Bois]]** — Squire in Roscombe who recalls Geoffrey’s brief visit, his audience with Elowen, and her sense that he was a dubious character.
- **[[Bertrand LeBlanc]]** — Innkeeper at [[The Traveler's Rest]]; remembers Geoffrey as a solitary guest who took long trips into the Highmoor and left in March with climbing gear.
- **[[Emma Cole]]** — Bertrand’s niece and chambermaid who once glimpsed Geoffrey’s annotated map marked with Avatus and circled sites in the mountains north of the Umber.
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** — Castellan of Roscombe; her notes on past audiences with Geoffrey lead the party to Master Ernault and grant them access to the archives.
- **Master [[Ernault]]** — Elderly scholar whose cluttered study holds Roscombe’s early records; he recalls Geoffrey’s arrogance and identifies [[Serethwyn Tor]] as a sealed hill-fort tied to old ranger orders.
- **[[Geoffrey]], the Stranger** — Mysterious Avatus-obsessed visitor who scoured records, ranged the moors, and likely unearthed Duncan’s cursed axe at Serethwyn Tor.
- **[[Caradoc]]** — Alchemist near [[Brantor]] who provides magic items, agrees to prepare more Trueflame, and warns the party about Arvanko’s prickly demeanor.
- **[[Arvanko]] the Stoneborn** — Tall Stoneborn ranger crafting a stone monument to fallen rangers in western Addermarch; skeptical at first, he eventually marks Serethwyn Tor on their map and entrusts them with a Drankorian sending stone.
- **[[Cadan]]** — Ranger commemorated on Arvanko’s monument as having died in battle at Serethwyn Tor.

## Places

- **[[Roscombe]]** — Market town and base of operations; home to [[The Traveler's Rest]], Lady Duval’s manor, and Master Ernault’s archives.
- **[[The Traveler's Rest]]** — Roscombe inn where the party lodges and gathers testimony from Bertrand LeBlanc and Emma Cole about Geoffrey.
- **Duval Manor** — Lady Duval’s manor and administrative center, where her notes and Master [[Ernault]]’s records reveal the warning about [[Serethwyn Tor]].
- **[[Brantor]]** and **Caradoc’s Cottage** — Nearby village and hill-country home of [[Caradoc]], where the heroes acquire magic items and arrange for more [[Trueflame]].
- **Arvanko’s Homestead** — Isolated Stoneborn ranger’s home marked by a growing stone monument to fallen rangers; starting point for the party’s march toward Serethwyn Tor.
- **[[Serethwyn Tor]]** — Ruined hill-fort in the Highmoor, destroyed long ago and ordered undisturbed by ranger edict; likely site of ancient Avatus relics and Duncan’s cursed axe.
- **[[Adderfell]]** and **[[Sembara]]** — Distant lands mentioned as possible repositories of the lost Serpentine Register that lists cursed weapons and their fates.

## Narrative

### Saturday, May 22nd, 2 Robert I

The party wakes at [[The Traveler's Rest]] in [[Roscombe]] and begins the day by chasing the trail of Geoffrey, the stranger dead in Duncan's cottage and connected to the [[Serpentine Battleaxe]]. After making a lunchtime appointment to meet [[Elowen Duval]], they stop at to speak with [[Colette du Bois]], who remembers Geoffrey staying at the inn, having a brief audience with [[Elowen Duval]], and giving off a dubious, secretive air. 

Back at the inn, they speak with [[Bertrand LeBlanc]], who recalls Geoffrey arriving from [[Valcroix]] in the fall. The man mostly kept to his room, eating alone and disappearing for days at a time into the [[Highmoor]]. In March he departed in earnest, outfitted for a serious venture: ropes, ladders, and the gear of someone planning to climb or delve. [[Emma Cole]], Bertrand’s niece and the inn’s chambermaid, shares that once, while tidying Geoffrey’s room, she glimpsed a map spread on his table, crammed with annotations in a strange language. One word she recognized—[[Avatus]]—and she recalls several spots circled, especially in the mountains north of the [[Umber]].

At lunch with Lady [[Elowen Duval]], she tells the party she remembers Geoffrey as suspicious and insistent about accessing the founding records of [[Carlinshire]]. Her notes confirm that she allowed him to speak with [[Ernault]] but refused to let him copy anything. After lunch, she sends the party on to Ernault with her blessing to read and copy as they wish.

Up in a cluttered study stacked with papers and tomes, [[Ernault]] remembers Geoffrey well—rude, dismissive, and only interested in copying passages about [[Avatus]]-era history, not in Ernault's scholarly interpretations. Ernault admits he is no numismatist and cannot date the party’s coin, but he happily shares his knowledge of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] and the old frontier. Among the early records he notes an odd entry: [[Serethwyn Tor]], an old hill-fort, was destroyed and ordered “not to be disturbed” by the rangers of the time. If ancient things still lie buried anywhere, Ernault suggests, that would be a prime candidate. He also mentions [[Arvanko]] the Stoneborn, a ranger active in the area who may know more.

Leaving the keep, the heroes head out of town toward [[Caradoc]]’s cottage. There they collect magic items from Caradoc's old adventuring days that he gifted them, and commission another batch of [[Trueflame]] to unmake the battle axe. Caradoc warns that Arvanko is prickly but trustworthy, and after stocking up on healing potions the party camps along the road leading into the hills.

### Sunday, May 23rd, 2 Robert I

Pushing their pace through the uplands, the party reaches [[Arvanko]]’s homestead by mid‑afternoon. The tall Stoneborn ranger, with gray‑black mottled skin, is working on an immense stone monument carved with the names of rangers who have fallen in western Addermarch. Curt and wary, he greets the strangers with suspicion: why, he demands, do they want to know where old cursed weapons lie?

Yvan’s earnest explanation sways him, and Arvanko accepts that the party is trying to contain danger rather than unleash it. He points out [[Serethwyn Tor]] on the carved monument and on their map, noting that a ranger named [[Cadan]] died there in battle long ago and that the rangers send someone past every year or two to ensure the site remains undisturbed. It has been a year since the last check, he admits, and another is overdue.

Arvanko also speaks of a registry of serpentine weapons, a set of records listing known cursed weapons and their fates. Locally, he believes it was lost, though a copy might still survive in [[Adderfell]] or [[Sembara]]. Before they depart, he gifts the party a low-range [[Drankorian Message Stone]], and asks them to report in once they reach Serethwyn Tor. The party then heads back toward [[Caradoc]]’s cottage, camping on the cart track as night falls.

### Monday, May 24th, 2 Robert I

The next day, the party reaches [[Caradoc]]'s by midday, and pick up their commissioned dose of [[Trueflame]]. They then turn northeast, heading into the Highmoor towards  [[Serethwyn Tor]], walking for the rest of the afternoon before camping for the night.
