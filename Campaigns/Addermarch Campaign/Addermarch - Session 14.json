  "shortSummary": "In the Feywild and Highmoor, the party destroys the corrupted Singing Tree, rescues the fey Vaelithar, partially disables the Nightsong Roots portal, and returns to Haldrenn.",
  "longSummary": "Creeping toward a forest clearing in the Feywild, Yvan, Drou, and Fazoth close in on the scorched Singing Tree whose cursed song has been driving beasts mad. Fazoth's Witch Bolt, Yvan's fiery spells, and Drou's daggers clash with the tree's grappling roots and bludgeoning branches, while the song twists Fazoth and Drou into attacking each other until Yvan's final Sorcerous Burst fells the tree's current form. Searching the churned soil, they cut free Vaelithar of Twilight's Edge from a root-wrapped mound, learning how he and his companion Liraene nearly slew the tree before a mortal with an impossibly sharp axe and glowing green gem stole its heart, warping its song toward violence; the tree, he warns, will regrow unless its heart is returned. Recovering Liraene's body and accepting a fey pact wand and a silver ring, the party returns through the portal and, combining Yvan's ice magic with Drou's music, fractures several of the Nightsong Roots chimes to partially disable the gateway before trekking back toward Haldrenn and arriving just before lunch the next day.",
