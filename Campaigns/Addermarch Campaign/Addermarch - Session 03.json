  "shortSummary": "In Roscombe and the Stonewolds, the party hunts a cockatrice for Caradoc, bargains with a naiad, and returns stolen Duval jewels and a strange Sibylline symbol.",
  "longSummary": "While resting at The Traveler's Rest in Roscombe, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan receive letters from Owen Tavish and Lady Elowen Duval before meeting with the alchemist Caradoc, who hires them to retrieve a cockatrice gizzard. Traveling west through fields and into the Stonewolds, they locate a cave near the Kilrath Standing Stones, where they discover a petrified dwarf, battle a shadow-animated skeleton, and slay an adult cockatrice and its hatchlings in a cavern containing a dormant fey gate and a petrified shepherd boy. A furious naiad binds Fazoth and Yvan until they cleanse red algae from her pool, revealing lost treasure including Duval family jewels and a golden holy symbol of the Sibyl. With gizzard, eggs, and loot in hand, they camp on the road, detour to Brantor to deliver the gizzard to Caradoc, then return to Roscombe to return the jewels and claim a bandit bounty from Lady Duval.",
