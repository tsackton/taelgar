## Narrative

### Tuesday, May 18th, 2 Robert I

[[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], and [[Drou]] continue to follow a worg trail across the [[Highmoor]]. Several hours pass as the trail continues up and down the next ridge, and then turns northeast towards a strange foggy depression some miles off. 

By late afternoon, [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] arrive at the [[~Highmoor Fey Portal~|foggy depression]]. Their is a deep unnatural feeling to the fog, as it clings and clusters to the roots of a massive fallen tree with no regard for the sun. An occasional faint wind rustles the roots, which hang strangely like wind chimes. After some experimentation by [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] with _Elementalism_, which causes the wind-chime-like roots to play haunting sounds, [[Drou]] is able to replicate the notes and opens a portal in the fallen tree. 

A hollow man emerges and attacks. Remembering the rhyme, the party focuses on fire damage, and the creature is quickly dispatched. Stepping into the [[Feywild]], the party follows a path through a dense, dark forest. On the path, they are attacked by small fey, a group of thorn-like creatures and a flying archer with ice arrows. 

Our session ends as these attackers are defeated and the party hears the disquieting sounds of a singing tree ahead.
