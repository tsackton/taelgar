## Narrative

### Wednesday, May 19th, 2 Robert I

Returning to town, the party stops to speak with [[Helen of Haldrenn]], the temple administrator at the Temple of the Mother in the village. She tells them the basic story: Duncan lived alone in a small stone cottage on the edge of the village; he was a shepherd and would spend the summers up in the high moors with his flock, but in the winters he spent most of his time hanging out at [[Alewyn]]'s, whose hearth served as an informal pub in the winters. He was boastful, and most people thought he just talked big, even when he kept talking about a secret treasure. So the village was surprised when, last March, he said he had had enough sitting around and left, never to return. Most people think he died in the big late storm that came through in April. She also tells them that Duncan's cottage (now empty) sits on the ridge above the coppice wood, and the charcoal burners might have seen him when he left. 

The party then gathers information. First they talk to [[Alewyn]], who is excited to see them having heard the tale of their defense of the village from worgs, and feeds them lunch of stew and sauteed apples. She tells them the same basic story as Helen, but says that this past winter, something changed, and Duncan sounded more serious about actually having information about a secret treasure, and about planning his journey. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] gives her 1 gold piece for her trouble, for which she is very grateful. Next, the party speaks with [[Bran]] and [[Karl]], on their way to Duncan's cottage. [[Bran]] says that a few weeks ago, he saw a fire up on the ridge, and heard shouting in the middle of the night, but the next morning [[Karl]] checked it out (briefly and cautiously) and didn't see anything. 

Duncan's cottage is a simple one room stone and thatch affair, with a hearth, a table, and a straw bed. There is blood on the doorframe, though, that [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] notices, while [[Drou]] finds smeared ash from the hearth suggesting a struggle and a heavy body being dragged, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] notices that the shepherd's crook is broken and hastily mended. Concluding that there was a fight in the cottage, but the body was dragged out, the party goes to search the root cellar. The latch on the door is broken, and inside are the signs of a fire: burned apples, turnips, and straw. Beneath the burned straw is a dead body, from which a vengeful spirit rises to attack. Though it immolates Yvan at the beginning of combat, it cannot leave the root cellar and between Fazoth and Yvan's _Witch Bolt_ spells and Drou's _Shatter_ spell, it is defeated, though [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] is nearly killed. 

After the haunt is killed, the party searches the body. [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] deduces it was likely killed by an axe, though there is also evidence of blunt force trauma. The party also finds scattered ancient coins and treasure (120 ancient gold coins, 300 ancient silver coins, a pendant that looks like a amulet of [[The Warlord]]), and burned scraps of notes, which they take. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], with his painter skills, makes a painting of the dead body. 

That evening, the party warns the town and gets a good night's rest.

### Thursday, May 20th, 2 Robert I

In the morning, the party departs for [[Roscombe]]. On the road, and at camp that evening, they piece together bits of the fragments of paper. They seem to mostly be the rantings of a madman: "It needs me to find a new heart for his master" or "Must go home, get the heart from the old stories" or "The axe will help me with my quest". But there are occasionally moments of lucidity too: "It haunts my dreams, and I cannot make it stop".

### Friday, May 21st, 2 Robert I

The party arrives at [[Caradoc]]'s cottage in the early afternoon. They speak with him for a while. He reveals that indeed he went by Aurenxis when he traveled in the [[Feywild]] long ago, to keep his true identity safe from mischief. He reminds them about [[Morlaith]] and the dangers of the [[Feywild]], and tells them that if they are venturing into the wilds after Duncan, they should stop by his cottage first. He has some old adventuring gear to give them. He also suggests they speak to [[Owen Tavish]] in town about the old coins. 

%% Caradoc pulls Fazoth aside, tells him he knows of his family, and they should say [[Caradoc]] is Aurenxis%%

The party returns to [[Roscombe]], and meets with Owen Tavish before dinner. He tells them that 300 years ago, a war was fought in these parts against the armies of the [[Dominion of Avatus]]. He identifies the old coins found on the corpse in Duncan's cottage as being dated from the reign of [[Derik I]], who ruled during the war against [[Avatus]]; indeed, these coins are from the same era as those found with the [[Serpentine Dagger]], he says. Owen suggests that the coins could plunder and to investigate old forts and battlefields from the ancient wars to find more. 

We end as the party returns to [[The Traveler's Rest]] to sleep.
