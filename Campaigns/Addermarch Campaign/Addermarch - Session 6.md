- **(DR:: 1715-05-10):** [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] purchase ropes, torches, and climbing gear while gathering cave lore from [[Colette du Bois]] and other locals to pinpoint the closest subterranean system.

The party settles in to watch for the night.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-12), just after midnight:** An **ankheg** erupts from the pasture; simultaneous witch-bolt strikes from [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], plus [[Drou]]’s support, subdue the monster before serious harm is done.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-12), dawn:** [[Samatha of Fontwick|Samatha]] receives a generous purse from [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] to replace her herd and provisions the adventurers with bread, cheese, and apples as they continue their journey toward the rumored deep caverns.

## Narrative 

### Sunday, May 9th, 2 Robert I
We begin on Sunday afternoon, in [[Roscombe]]. The party spends the day uneventfully, stopping at the regular weekly market for a few purchases, before meeting [[Caradoc]] in the evening. [[Caradoc]] is impressed with their work so far, and proposes a harder challenge: descend into the deep caverns below the earth, and recover [[Uligium]], a living mineral that is highly valued for alchemical purposes. The party agrees.

### Monday, May 10th, 2 Robert I
The party spends the next day in preparation, buying rope and other supplies for cave exploration, and asking  [[Colette du Bois]] and others around town for information about the closest deep cave system.

### Tuesday, May 11th, 2 Robert I
The party departs [[Roscombe]] early, heading west towards where rumors indicate the deepest cave system nearby is located. The first part of the journey, along a cart track towards the village of [[Fontwick]], is uneventful as the party passes through fields and pastures. Around mid-afternoon, the party encounters two distraught dairy farmers, [[Samatha of Fontwick]] and [[Godfrey of Fontwick]]. Their cows have been killed by a terrible burrowing insect creature of massive size, and they are fleeing towards [[Roscombe]] to ask for aid from Lady [[Elowen Duval]]. 

The party decides to help, and [[Samatha of Fontwick]] leads them back to her farm while [[Godfrey of Fontwick]] continues to [[Roscombe]] to inform [[Elowen Duval]] of the happenings. The party keeps watch on the fields through the evening, until around midnight an ankheg bursts from the ground and attacks. Quickly both [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] attack it with witch bolts, but it burrows underground, breaking the connect of the spell. Nonetheless, it is subdued without serious trouble.

### Wednesday, May 12th, 2 Robert I
We end the morning of the next day. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] gives [[Samatha of Fontwick]] a substantial sum of coins to buy new cows; she is incredibly thankful, offering bread, cheese, and apples for the road.
