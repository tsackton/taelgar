  "longSummary": "On the road from Valcroix toward Roscombe, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan escort Oona Stonebridge through orchards and into the Torvaine Forest. After clearing a deadfall and surviving an ambush by burrowing mohlers, they find a blood-drained peddler apparently fleeing Torvaine Watch. Reaching the hilltop garrison, they are warned by a ghostly knight and then battle zombies in the mess hall and barracks. Looting the keep, they recover a key, treasure, and Marshal Hildo Brask's troubling letter before ending the session in his quarters.",
