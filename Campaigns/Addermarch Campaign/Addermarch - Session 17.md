%% RAW notes 
start on the road on 5/24, mid-afternoon
next morning - uneventful day of travel, beautiful spring day in the high moors; camp
5/26 - days starts nice. reach the hills, start to climb following an old road
reach road to fort around 3 pm
takes a couple of hours to hike up to the fort, following a track
about 1000 feet from the wall - see marker saying in three languages that the fort is dangerous and sealed off
approach wall - pseudodragon flies over, killed by skeletons

initiative - fight skeleton army
yvan - two fireballs, then scorching ray, then sorcerous burst
drou - does a lot of bludgeoning damage; nearly dies from arrows; gets off a good shatter though, and summons python at the end, also uses dissondant whispers
fazoth - witch bolt to start misses and isn't effective; loses concentration; but then eldritch blast and summon fey is very strong

a fey key silvery barbs keep drou alive
good use of cover by everyone, especially yvan

skeletons eventually worn down and taken out

after battle, explore:

drou learns that disturbed earth is recent, a week or two at most, from skeletons coming out of the earth, not digging
yvan doesn't find secret doors but notices scorch marks from fire, and the wooden door to the mine cut with an axe - recently
fazoth explores keep - sees a boot of a suit of armor under rubble, notices the keep was destroyed by fire a long long time ago, and finds broken pieces of a map showing at least three levels, the main serpentine source on level 2 or 3, two air shafts that reach to the top

discuss the timeline of duncan for a bit, piecing it together

got to explore the officer's mess and see skeletons - end session there
