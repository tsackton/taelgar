## Narrative

### Monday, May 24th, 2 Robert I

We begin as the party settles into camp for the evening, on the road into the Highmoor, following the trail of [[Duncan of Haldrenn]] to uncover the mystery of the cursed [[Serpentine Battleaxe]] and [[Serethwyn Tor]].

### Tuesday, May 25th, 2 Robert I

The next morning is a fine spring day, a beautiful day of uneventful travel on the moors. The party camps in the foothills of [[Westcliff]] in preparation for the climb to [[Serethwyn Tor]] the next day. 

### Wednesday, May 25th, 2 Robert I

After a morning of walking and quick lunch, the party climbs into the hills following an old abandoned road. By early afternoon, the road peters out and an old track leads up into the peaks of [[Westcliff]] to the hill fort of [[Serethwyn Tor]]. After a couple of hours hiking on the along the old track, the party sees the walls of the fort, partially ruined, about a 1000 feet ahead. A marker, written in three languages (Sembaran, Elvish, and Stoneborn) warns the fort ahead is dangerous, and sealed by order of [[The Rangers]]. The party approaches, with Fazoth's pseudodragon flying ahead to scout - only to be killed by a large group of skeletons on the other side of the wall. 

Fazoth, Yvan, and Drou join the fight against about 40 skeletons, including a large group of foot soldiers with sargents, and a few captains with ogre skeleton bodyguards. Yvan launches multiple fireballs, mowing down the ranks of the weaker skeletons, while arrows rain down around Yvan, Drou, and Fazoth. Drou takes the brunt of the attacks, some dodging arrows but many find their mark. She cracks skeletons with her flashing fists and thunder spells, which rip through the ranks as well. Fazoth attempts to pin down one of the captain's with Witch Bolt, but loses concentration on the spell. However, Fazoth's summoned fey ally is strong, and Drou responds to near-death by tossing her new Staff of the Python on the ground, as it turns into a giant constructor snake to fight for her. 

Finally, the party finishes off the skeletons, and explores. Drou examines the ground, and notices the disturbed earth from the skeletons emerging from the ground is recent, a week or two at most, suggesting that when Duncan first came for the axe there were no skeletons here. Yvan searches for secret doors; while he does not find any, he does notice more scorch marks from fire, suggesting parts of the fort were burned down a long time ago. Fazoth explores the small ruined keep, finding a broken pieces of a mine map showing at least three levels, with the main serpentine source on the 2nd or 3rd level down, and two air shafts that reach to the top of the hill. 

The party regroups to explore the officer's barracks and mess. Our session ends as Yvan looks in at glowing skeletal eyes inside the building.

approach wall - pseudodragon flies over, killed by skeletons

initiative - fight skeleton army
yvan - two fireballs, then scorching ray, then sorcerous burst
drou - does a lot of bludgeoning damage; nearly dies from arrows; gets off a good shatter though, and summons python at the end, also uses dissondant whispers
fazoth - witch bolt to start misses and isn't effective; loses concentration; but then eldritch blast and summon fey is very strong
