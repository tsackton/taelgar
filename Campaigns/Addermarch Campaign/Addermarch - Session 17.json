  "shortSummary": "Following clues to the cursed Serpentine Battleaxe, the party crosses the Highmoor, reaches Serethwyn Tor, fights a large skeleton force, and uncovers signs of recent disturbance and a broken mine map pointing deeper underground.",
  "longSummary": "From camp on the Highmoor road, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan travel in fair spring weather and camp in the foothills of Westcliff before climbing toward Serethwyn Tor. A warning marker notes the fort is sealed by order of The Rangers, and Fazoth's pseudodragon scout is killed by a mass of skeletons inside the walls. The party battles dozens of skeleton soldiers with sergeants, captains, and skeletal ogre bodyguards, then searches the ruins, finding recent disturbed earth, old scorch marks, and a broken mine map that hints at multiple levels and serpentine sources below.",
