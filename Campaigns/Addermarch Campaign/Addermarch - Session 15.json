  "shortSummary": "Returning to Haldrenn, the party investigates Duncan's cottage, defeats the haunted shade in his root cellar, uncovers ancient coins and maddened notes, and brings their findings to Caradoc and Owen Tavish in Roscombe.",
  "longSummary": "Back in Haldrenn, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan speak with Helen of Haldrenn at the Temple of the Mother, with innkeeper Alewyn, and with Bran and Karl to reconstruct Duncan's departure: a boastful shepherd who spent winters at Alewyn's hearth, grew oddly serious about a secret treasure, and vanished during a spring storm. Visiting his one-room stone cottage on the ridge, Yvan spots blood on the doorframe while Drou and Fazoth find signs of a struggle and a broken shepherd's crook, leading them to the root cellar where a burned body lies beneath scorched produce and straw; when disturbed, a vengeful shade erupts, immolating Yvan before being trapped in the cellar and destroyed by Witch Bolts and Shatter. Searching the corpse, they discover it was likely killed by an axe, along with scattered ancient gold and silver coins, a pendant resembling an amulet of the Warlord, and fragments of mad notes about finding a new heart for 'his master' and a questing axe. On the road back through Brantor to Roscombe, Caradoc reveals his Feywild alias Aurenxis and offers gear for a future foray after Duncan's trail, while Owen Tavish identifies the coins as dating from the wars against the Dominion of Avatus under Derik I and links them to the era of the Serpentine Dagger, inspiring thoughts of old forts and battlefields to investigate.",
