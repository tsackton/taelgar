## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1715-05-14), morning:** Over fried-mushroom pancakes in **[[Zibzig Sparkscale]]’s** lair, the kobold inventor shares directions to an [[uligium]] cache and warns of “lurkers above the water.” 
- **(DR:: 1715-05-14), midday:** Reaching a pool-filled cavern beyond a chasm, the party is plunged into magical darkness as four **darkmantles** drop from the ceiling; [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]]’s fiery surges, [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]’s lightning-guided pseudodragon, and [[Drou]]’s tenacity shatter the creatures. Heated glass lures fresh **[[uligium]]** from the tunnel walls.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-14), late afternoon:** Guided back to the surface route, they pacify the ogre and wolf at the cave mouth with [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]’s _Calm Emotions_ and escape unharmed, bearing four vials of [[uligium]].
- **(DR:: 1715-05-14), night:** The heroes trek eastward and camp in open farmland en-route to [[Roscombe]].
- **(DR:: 1715-05-15), evening:** After a day’s march and a stop in [[Brantor]] to deliver their alchemical prize, the party arrives safely in **[[Roscombe]]**.

## Narrative

### Friday, May 14th, 2 Robert I

We begin in the morning, as the party wakes to the smell of fried mushroom pancakes and a smoky tea being prepared for breakfast by [[Zibzig Sparkscale]]. The kobold wizard is in a chatty mood, discussing the magic that he will invent, with time, and asking for help for memorable names for the spells he will be discovering. Grateful for the party's help with the [[Addermarch - Session 09|cave fisher the day before]], Zibzig gives them directions to another source of [[Uligium]] he knows of, and the way out of the cave. He does warn them that the [[uligium]] is defended by strange predators who lurk over the water. 

The party follows the directions, finding their way to a cavern with a chasm to one side, across which lies a still pool of water and a small tunnel. As the party approaches, suddenly impenetrable blackness falls as the party attacks the darkmantles. Four of them detach from the ceiling to attack; [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] surges with magical power as he fires bolts of fire blindly into the darkness. Meanwhile lightning crackles from [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], as his pseudodragon uses its blindsight to aid him in the fight. [[Drou]] struggles to get a purchase on the enemy in the dark, but eventually the darkmantles are defeated. With magical energy still ricochetting around [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], he approaches the tunnel, heating a glass bottle with his hand and attracting the [[Uligium]]. 

Following [[Zibzig Sparkscale]]'s directions, the party returns to the cave entrance without trouble. At the entrance, the ogre and his wolf still stand guard, but [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s _Calm Emotions_ spell keeps them indifferent to the party for a moment as they flee out of the cave.

With their four vials of [[uligium]], the party heads back torwards [[Roscombe]], traveling for the whole day before camping in the fields.

### Saturday, May 15th, 2 Robert I
The party spends the day traveling, arriving back at [[Roscombe]] in the evening.
