## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1715-05-05):** In [[Roscombe]], the party sells the vial of magical weapon-oil looted from [[Torvaine Watch]] and purchases extra healing potions at the bustling market square.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-06), morning:** At the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]], the party confers with [[Owen Tavish]] about the [[Serpentine Dagger]], and sell him an ancient Sibylline holy symbol.   
- **(DR:: 1715-05-06), afternoon:** At [[Caradoc]]’s cottage near [[Brantor]], the party commissions a dose of [[Trueflame]] to aid in destroying the [[Serpentine Dagger]], and accepts a contract to recover a stolen “glowing poison” recipe from local [[goblins]].
- **(DR:: 1715-05-07), evening:** Over dinner in Lady **[[Elowen Duval]]’s** hall—complete with [[Drou]]’s performance, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]]’s live painting, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]’s fireworks—they learn from Captain **[[Gareth Howell]]** of a goblin hideout and his missing squire; the party vows to investigate.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08), morning:** Trekking north into the hills they reach a cave entrance, trigger a collapsing-floor trap, and rout the first wave of goblin sentries with chromatic orbs, invisibility, and misty step.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08), afternoon:** Following tracks to a hidden trapdoor they descend, dodge another pit alarm, burst into the goblin living-quarters, and—after a brutal melee of cloud-of-daggers, fist-flurries, and arcane blasts—slay the bandits and seize the room.

## Narrative
### Wednesday, May 5th, 2 Robert I
We begin in [[Roscombe]], at [[The Traveler's Rest]], where [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] are staying. Having returned with gold from the cockatrice lair, the party spends the day at the market, selling the magic weapon oil found in [[Torvaine Watch]], and buying healing potions.

### Thursday, May 6th, 2 Robert I
The next day, [[Owen Tavish]] has returned from laying the ghost of [[Einrik Arpaad]] to rest at [[Torvaine Watch]], and the party goes to the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]] to speak with Owen. At the temple -- one of the larger buildings in [[Roscombe]], and clearly the center of the religious life of the town -- they meet [[Isolde of Roscombe|Isolde]], the temple steward, who brings them to speak with Owen. [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and Owen discuss the [[Serpentine Dagger]], with Owen suggesting that the alchemical substance [[Trueflame ]]might be useful for destroying it, as it allows forge fires to get exceptionally hot. After speaking about the dagger, the party shows Owen the old holy symbol of the Sibyl recovered from the cockatrice lair, which Owen offers to buy. The meeting ends with [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and Owen exchanging Thaumaturgy effects and playing a game of chess. 

After speaking with Owen, the party walks to [[Caradoc]]'s house outside of the small village of [[Brantor]], to ask about [[Trueflame]]. [[Caradoc]] is curious, and agrees to make it for them, but requires expensive ingredients, especially mercury ash. After giving a 50 gold down payment, he agrees to start, with another 100 gold to be paid when the [[Trueflame]] is ready in a few days. 

[[Caradoc]] also tells the party he wants to recover a recipe for a Glowing Poison that some [[goblins]] stole from a messenger a few months ago, and he will pay 200 gold for it if they bring it back to him. 

After speaking with [[Caradoc]], the party returns to town. 

### Friday, May 7th, 2 Robert I
The next morning, the party is invited to dine at the manor with [[Elowen Duval]] and her courtiers, including [[Gareth Howell]], the leader of her household guard. Elowen has asked [[Drou]] to perform, and she spends the day preparing her pieces. Eager to also contribute, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] works on a painting, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] uses his alchemical skills to make fireworks. 

The dinner is interesting. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]]'s live painting is a bit of a strange show as he paints by just splashing paint haphazardly on the sheet, somehow a form emerging from the chaos, but the final product is not amazing. Grumpy at the result, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] makes the food too salty with Prestidigitation. However, [[Drou]] saves the evening with her stellar performance, entertaining the crowd and setting up [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s small fireworks show. 

During the dinner, the party speaks with [[Gareth Howell]], who tells them that the [[goblins]] have not been much of a nuisance, but a young squire in his employ decided to go handle them anyway a few week's ago, and hasn't been seen since. He tells the party where to find the lair, and asks if they are going that way, if they can look for his missing squire. 

### Saturday, May 8th, 2 Robert I
The next day, the party leaves [[Roscombe]] early for the goblin lair, walking north into the hills. After a half-day of walking, they reach a rocky outcropping where they find a trail, and a cave. [[Drou]] speaks to a nearby bird, who tells them that no one goes into the cave, but that sometimes a giant spider comes past. Deciding to explore the cave despite [[Drou]]'s concerns about a possible trap, the party does indeed trigger a trap, with the floor of the cave collapsing into a pit trap, the noise of which summons some nearby guards. However, the party easily defeats the [[goblins]], aided largely by [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] using seeking spell to help his Chromatic Orb spell bounce from one goblin to another. [[Drou]] casts Invisibility to remain unseen as she climbs out of the pit, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] uses his Misty Step to teleport. 

Sneaking from the cave, along the goblin tracks, the party finds an empty clearing, and another tunnel full of spider webs. After briefly investigating the spider tunnel, the party finds a hidden trap door in the middle of the clearing, where the goblin trail stops. The party discusses and decides it is probably better to investigate the trapdoor than the spider tunnel, and ties a rope to a branch to climb down. 

At the bottom of the trapdoor is a dirt tunnel leading to a door. The party proceeds down the tunnel, triggering another pit trap but managing to avoid landing with a loud bang on the iron pots at the bottom that serve as an alarm. The party then barges through the door into the apparent living quarters of the goblin bandits. A fight ensues, during which [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] uses Cloud of Daggers to great effect, while [[Drou]] wades into combat with flying fists and bardic inspiration. The session ends as the party defeats the [[goblins]].
