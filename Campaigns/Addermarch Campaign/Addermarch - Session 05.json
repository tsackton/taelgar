  "shortSummary": "In the Highmoor and Roscombe, the party rescues Colette du Bois, slays the goblin queen, secures the glowing poison recipe, and uses Trueflame to destroy the Serpentine Dagger.",
  "longSummary": "Deep in the goblin lair, Yvan infiltrates the guardroom disguised as a goblin and discovers Colette du Bois imprisoned, prompting a swift fight in which the party kills the drunken jailers and frees her. After a short rest, Drou negotiates with the lair's skittering spiders by bribing them with beef, allowing the group to reach the throne room through a secret door. There they battle the goblin queen and her minions in a brutal confrontation, ultimately claiming a treasure chest and the stolen glowing poison recipe Caradoc desires. That evening they return to Roscombe via Brantor to trade the recipe and gold for Trueflame, and the next morning, under Owen Tavish's supervision in the Temple of the Sibyl, they finally destroy the cursed serpentine dagger.",
