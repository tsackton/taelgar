%% RAW NOTES %%
start in chamber where unicorn fight was, after long rest
exit mine, go back through work shed / Duncan's camp, climb hill
find ventilation shaft
pseudodragon scouts, sees serpentine ghouls
tie rope via iron spike, start to climb down (Drou first, then Yvan, then Fazoth)
Yvan climbs while Drou still on rope, weight is too much, iron spike pulls out, Drou and Yvan fall, Yvan lands in a heap while Drou lands gracefully
Fazoth misty steps

---

combat 1 - against serpentine ghouls
shatter alerts dungeon, otherwise eldritch blast + pseudodragon (poison but sadly they are immune to poison), sorcerous burst plus a few low level spells deals with enemies
burn bodies
take ~300 silver pieces in treasure

---

explore this level. skip the dusty/abandoned mine area, come to the place where Duncan obviously was. 
find the path down, old mine stuff, some crushed bodies that don't reanimate
evidence duncan went this way
follow path down

---

lowest level
ghouls licking the walls for specks of serpentine, turn and attack
giant snake takes brunt of damage and gets to quite low HP, gets paralyzed at one point by ghoul attack
tight quarters
witch bolt from fazoth strong
drou mostly daggers and punches, plus snake, plus moonbeam
when enemies mostly dealt with yvan surges into max damage spell
steps forward to fireball
blasts next wave of enemies coming, mostly wiping them out
wrap up battle quickly after fireball
hear rhythmic thudding from next area
decide not to short rest (too dangerous) 
end session as the party proceeds up the path to the boss fight
