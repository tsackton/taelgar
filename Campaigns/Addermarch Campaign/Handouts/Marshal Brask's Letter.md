Aida,

It is with great sadness that I write you. I am Marshal [[Hildo Brask]], second in command of [[Torvaine Watch]] under Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]. Our chaplain, [[Wulfram]], has no doubt reached you by now with the news of Piri’s accidental passing and has returned your brother’s possessions to you. Unfortunately, our commander dispatched [[Wulfram]] so suddenly that I did not realize he was going until he had already gone. Otherwise, I would have sent this letter and these items along with him.

You will be pleased to know [[Piri]] was well liked by his fellows. He raised our spirits during the wet, boring winters here. He was quick with a joke and a song. He even took up whittling small trinkets. I thought you might appreciate the figure he carved for me, which I have included. His fellows and I have pooled some coin together. I know no amount of gold can ease your loss, but...

(the letter trails off, obviously meant to be finished)
