The party learns of strange happenings in [[Haldrenn]] and rescues a lost girl. 

## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1715-05-16):** [[Caradoc]] visits the party in [[Roscombe]] with rumors of maddened livestock in [[Haldrenn]], and asks the party to investigate.  After acquiring potions from [[Caradoc]] in [[Brantor]], the heroes march northeast into the [[Highmoor]] and camp in the open hills.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-17), day:** The party reaches [[Haldrenn]] in the late afternoon, and learns from nine-year-old [[Bran]] that six-year-old [[Rowena]] is missing and a funeral for [[Olay]] (gored by his own bull) is imminent. [[Bran]] recites a creepy “Hollow Men” rhyme said to warn of the [[Morlaith|Briarheart]].
- **(DR:: 1715-05-17), early evening:** Questions to charcoal-burner **[[Karl]]** and priest-storyteller **[[Helen of Haldrenn]]** uncover more of the strange events. [[Drou]]’s animal-speech reveal the cattle are tormented by a relentless song compelling violence.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-17), sunset:** Tracking prints and using [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]’s fey-lantern, the party follows [[Rowena]]’s trail east into the hills and locates her hiding in a cave filled with maddened bees. Swarms are dispersed by Cloud of Daggers, Chromatic Orb, and Dissonant Whispers; [[Rowena]] is rescued unharmed.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-17), night:** As the rescuers crest the last ridge toward [[Haldrenn]] the fey-lantern flares and the howls of worgs attacking the village echo across the darkened fields.

## Narrative
### Sunday, May 16th, 2 Robert I

In the morning, the party receives a visit from [[Caradoc]], who has come to speak with them in [[Roscombe]] after hearing troubling rumors of mad animals in the isolated village of [[Haldrenn]], in the [[Highmoor]] to the northeast. Warning the party that dangerous [[Fey]] may be involved, he asks them to investigate, but tell no one of what is happening. Agreeing, the party walks with [[Caradoc]] to [[Brantor]], where they trade a pearl and some gold for potions before heading northeast towards [[Haldrenn]]. 

Following a rough cart track through the hills, the party camps for the evening on the [[Highmoor]]. 

### Monday, May 17th, 2 Robert I

After nearly a full day of slow walking across the rolling hills and dales of the [[Highmoor]], the party reaches the village of [[Haldrenn]] in the late afternoon. [[Haldrenn]] is a small, isolated village, nestled in the shelter of a ridgeline which has been decorated with wood wards. The village has a reliable, year round spring, which feeds a small pond and a coppiced wood managed for charcoal. 

The village is quiet as the party arrives, with only some children playing with sheep and a pig. The party speaks with one of the children, a nine-year-old boy named [[Bran]]. From him, they learn that all the adults are out looking for a 6-year-old girl named [[Rowena]], who has been missing for more than a day. She frequently forages to the east of the village, away from the cow pastures, but always returns before nightfall, until now. [[Bran]] also tells the party that [[Olay]] was killed 10 days ago, by an enraged bull, and the funeral is tonight, so everyone should be back soon. According to [[Bran]], people say the problems are because of the [[Morlaith|Briarheart]], some kind of [[Fey]] entity who sends Hollow Men to get those who disobey. [[Bran]] doesn't know if this is real or not, but he tells the party the rhyme. 

*Knock, knock, knock;
The Hollow Man calls.
Swing, swing, swing;
His greedy sickle falls.
Chop, chop, chop; 
He takes another head.
Burn, burn, burn;
The Hollow Man is dead!*

[[Bran]] says his parents -- [[Karl]], who makes charcoal, and [[Isolde of Haldrenn]], Karl's wife -- might know more, so the party goes to speak to them, after leaving [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s pseudodragon on guard to watch the children. Isolde is out, but [[Karl]], a dour, soot-stained man in his 40s, is tending the smoking piles of timber that will be charcoal. [[Karl]] tells them about how [[Olay]]'s bull went crazy and killed [[Olay]] out of nowhere. The bull, as well as cows that similarly started attacking each other, are now tied up. From [[Karl]], the party also learns that [[Helen of Haldrenn]], the local priest, is also something of a collector of stories about the fey, and might know more about the Briarheart. 

[[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] speaks with [[Helen of Haldrenn]] while [[Drou]] performs the ritual to allow her to speak with animals. Helen tells [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] that she knows many fey stories, and that the Briarheart, also called [[Morlaith]], has many names. But she is preparing for [[Olay]]'s funeral and doesn't have time to speak at length now. [[Drou]] speaks to the mad bull, calming him slightly with her music, and learns he is being driven crazy by a song in his head that he cannot stop that is urging him to hurt people. The cows also hear the same song, although at least some animals, such as the sheep the kids were playing with, appear to have avoided this fate. They all want the song to stop, not surprisingly. 

With a few hours until sunset, the party decides to search for [[Rowena]], the missing girl. Careful searching uncovers what are obviously her tracks amidst the tangled prints of the people of the village who headed out to find her. Following the tracks, and having [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s pseudodragon carry his lantern of fey tracking overhead, the party slowly makes their way east, across the rolling hills. As the sun sets, they find the tracks lead into small, shallow cave from which a buzzing noise can be heard. 

Inside the cave, the party is attacked by three swarms of enraged bees. Although their stings are painful, [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s _Cloud of Daggers_, [[Drou]]'s _Dissonant Whispers_, and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]]'s _Chromatic Orb_ make quick work of them. As the few surviving bees flee, [[Rowena]] emerges from a small nook, where she had hidden, using her canvas foraging bag as cover to prevent the bees from being able to enter. 

Although it is now dark, the party sets out to return to [[Haldrenn]] with [[Rowena]]. We end as the party approaches the final hill, as the lantern of fey tracking lights up and the sound of worgs can be heard ahead, attacking the village.
