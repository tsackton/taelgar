## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1715-05-08), late afternoon:** Masquerading as a goblin, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] infiltrates the guardroom, locates captive squire **[[Colette du Bois]]**, and with [[Drou]] and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] swiftly cuts down the drunken jailers before freeing her. After bribing the lair’s giant skittering spiders with pantry beef, the party slips through a secret door, battles the goblin queen and her minions in the throne room, and secures both treasure and the stolen **glowing-poison recipe**.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08), evening:** The party returns to [[Roscombe]], stopping in **[[Brantor]]** to exchange the recipe (plus gold) for [[Caradoc]]’s completed vial of **[[Trueflame]]**.
- **(DR:: 1715-05-09), morning:** In the Temple of the Sibyl, [[Owen Tavish]] oversees as the heroes use [[Trueflame]] to finally destroy the cursed **[[Serpentine Dagger]]**.

## Narrative
### Saturday, May 8th, 2 Robert I

*Afternoon*: We begin in the common room and living quarters of the goblin bandits, the sound of drunken guards talking obvious through a door. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] sneaks into the guard room, dressed as a goblin, and convinces the rather drunk guards he was sent to check on the prisoner. He continues down the passage, and sees [[Colette du Bois]], a young human woman, locked in a cage. They speak briefly, and he learns she came scouting, sneakily, to investigate on behalf of [[Gareth Howell]] (or at least, with his knowledge), but was caught and now is likely to be fed to the giant spider soon. 

With no way to get the key except fight the guards, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] engages with the help of [[Drou]] and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]. Yvan's scorching ray, Fazoth's cloud of daggers, and Drou's dissonant whispers plus starry wisp make short work of the drunk guards, aided by Yvan's skin becoming magically resistant to damage. After finding the key, the party frees [[Colette du Bois]] before taking a short rest. 

Recovered with a short rest, [[Drou]] goes to speak with the skitterings, convincing them that a fight is not worthwhile, and feeding them a nice side of beef from the pantry and larder. With the skitterings temporarily at least tamed, the party enters the throne room via a secret door from the prison area. 
In the throne room, the party faces the queen of the goblin bandits. She is adept at calling her allies to fight and making them take damage when she is attacked. [[Drou]] uses Shatter to destroy many enemies, but is swarmed by attackers once in melee with the queen. [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] deals the killing blow to the queen, with Witch Bolt, but is attacked in retaliation. Finally, the minions and allies are defeated, and all is quiet in the throne room, allowing the party to find a treasure chest and recover what they came looking for. 

*Evening*: The party returns to [[Roscombe]], via [[Brantor]] where they speak with [[Caradoc]], trading the glowing poison recipe and some gold for the finished [[Trueflame]]. 

### Sunday, May 9th, 2 Robert I
In the morning, the party gathers with [[Trueflame]] in the company of [[Owen Tavish]], and destroys the [[Serpentine Dagger]].
