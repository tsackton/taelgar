  "longSummary": "Crossing the hoarding of Torvaine Watch, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan fend off stirges, defeat the undead smith Bartoz, and raise the fort's gates. In the commander's quarters they find Marshal Hildo Brask's body, confront the wrathful ghost of Sir Einrik Arpaad, and seize the cursed serpentine dagger before fleeing under a hail of debris. After recovering Brask's body and a treasure chest, they depart with Oona, traveling through the Torvaine Forest until they meet Sir Gareth Howell and his troop sent by Lady Elowen Duval. Reaching Roscombe, they turn over news of the watch's fall and are asked to consult Owen Tavish of the Sibyl about the dagger's destruction.",
