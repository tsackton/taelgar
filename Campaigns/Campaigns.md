---
- Great War. Canonical in vibes, major events, and overall arc, but not in detail, except as a source of inspiration. Current day invention should not invalidate the broad sweep of the campaign, or alter the stories of the PCs, but world details have been significantly updated. Started presumably sometime around DR 1544, ended canonically at the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]] in DR 1545. Finished. Approximately Level 1-20 in rough power level, but used a variety of systems. 
---
- Plaguelands. Not canonical. Not set in a specific time, but details are roughly coincident with Addermarch campaign, which is kind of a reboot of the Plaguelands campaign. Finished/abandoned. Ran maybe 15 sessions overall. Level 1-6. 
- Mike's Family Game. Not canonical, as the same events were run again with a different set of PCs. Three sessions. Finished/abandoned. 

## Mini-Campaigns

- Mawar Confederacy. Fully canonical. Started in DR 1747. Episodic campaign with minimal links between episodes and no firm conclusion, so potentially still active. Four episodes run so far. Level 6. 
- Labyrinths of the Lost. Fully canonical. Set sometime between the DR 1720s and 1740s, but not fully anchored in time. Three sessions, finished. Level 2-3. 
- Riswynn and Oskar One Shots. Fully canonical. Set during Riswynn's first separation from the Dunmar Fellowship (DuFr Sessions 17 - 37).  Three sessions, finished. Level ~5. 
---
- Ausson's Crossing. The high level setting, the basic plot arc, the major NPCs, and three of the four PCs are canonical, but other minor details are ambiguous, and the fourth PC was canonically not present (because the player reused him for Cleenseau game). Set in DR 1688. Four sessions, finished. Level 7-8.

### One Shots

One or two session single adventures. 

- Stone Titan Starter Adventure. The basic plot is canonical, but the details and the PCs are not necessarily. Set sometime during the Blood Years, possibly during the [[Sentinel Range War]] or the [[First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. Two sessions, finished. Level 5. 
---
- Informatics One Shot. Not canonical. Set in an ambiguous DR 1700s time frame. Two sessions, finished. Level 2-3. 
- Tollen One Shots. Not canonical, primarily because details are poorly recorded. Set in an ambiguous 1700s time frame. Two sessions (one D&D, one FATE), finished. Low level.
- Taelgar 2.0 Alexandria One Shot. Not canonical, although possibly canonical in an alternate timeline. Run in Alexandria in 2019, set in an alternate version of the Blood Years. GURPS rules, self-insert characters. Finished.
