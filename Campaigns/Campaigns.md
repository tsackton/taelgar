# Campaigns

This directory is intended to collect **campaign-specific** information for campaigns that have been run in Taelgar. The exact information contained in each directory can be in any style and will vary depending on the DM of each campaign. However, this would typically include: session notes; handouts, letters, stories, or other primary material introduced in game; treasure and equipment; and campaign-specific player-facing encyclopedia pages, such as indexes of NPCs or timelines. 

Ideally, NPCs, Places, and "significant" Things (for some nebulous definition of "significant") should also have official pages in the relevant directories. For things like Bastions or Followers/Hirelings, rule-oriented descriptions belong in Campaigns but the building itself should probably have a page in the Gazetteer, People, or Things as appropriate. 

## List of Campaigns and Adventures

The following is a comprehensive list of all campaigns, mini-campaigns, and single adventures that have been run in Taelgar, organized by length and canon status. 

*Only fully canonical campaigns are kept in the "Campaigns" directory. Semi- and non-canonical campaigns and one-shots can be found in the Worldbuilding/Campaigns directory.*

### Full Campaigns

Games that are, or at least were designed as, full length campaigns, consisting of multiple adventures linked in some way. 

#### Fully Canonical

- [ ] Great Library: Update Landing Page
- [ ] Great Library: Add old letters, handouts, and other in-game material
- [ ] Great Library: Clean up Tempest Towers
- [ ] Great Library: Decide about party treasure and what, if any, form it should exist in Obsidian
- [ ] Addermarch: Add Landing Page
- [ ] Addermarch: Decide about party treasure and what, if any, form it should exist in Obsidian
- [ ] Addermarch: Consider fixing in time so a timeline can be added

- [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]] (*Ongoing*): Fully canonical. Started in DR 1748. Well-organized campaign directory. 
- [[Cleenseau campaign]] (*Ongoing*): Fully canonical.  Started in DR 1719. Well-organized campaign directory. 
- [[Great Library Campaign]] (*Ongoing-ish*): Fully canonical. Started in DR 1747. Campaign directory has session notes and a timeline, but other aspects need organization; a high fraction of the campaign material for this campaign exists primarily in OneNote. 
- [[Addermarch Campaign]] (*Ongoing*): Fully canonical. Started sometime between DR 1720s and DR 1740s, but not yet fully anchored in time. Campaign directory has session notes and handouts, but needs a least a landing page, and maybe a timeline and party treasure details. 

#### Partially Canonical

- [[Great War Campaign]] *(Finished, approximately Level 1-20)*. Canonical in vibes, major events, and overall arc, but not in detail, except as a source of inspiration. Current day invention should not invalidate the broad sweep of the campaign, or alter the stories of the PCs, but world details have been significantly updated. Started presumably sometime around DR 1544, ended canonically at the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]] in DR 1545. Notes can be found in Worldbuilding/Campaigns/Great War. The PCs are canonical and are described in [[Heroes of the Great War]]. 

#### Not Canonical

Some notes and possibly interesting-to-reuse ideas are in Worldbuilding/Campaigns.

- Plaguelands *(Finished/abandoned, Level 1-6)*. Not canonical. Not set in a specific time, but details are roughly coincident with Addermarch campaign, which is kind of a reboot of the Plaguelands campaign with a different plot and structure. Ran maybe 15 sessions overall. Many notes remain in OneNote and some in Google Docs and elsewhere. 
- Mike's Family Game *(Finished/abandoned)*. Not canonical, as the same events were run again with a different set of PCs as the beginning of the [[Cleenseau Campaign]]. Three sessions. Minimal/no notes exist?

### Episodic Campaigns

Games that are organized around episodic one-shots, but sharing a common setting and at least some common characters between them. 

#### Fully Canonical

- [ ] Mawar: Update landing page
- [ ] Mawar: Update/double check session notes
- [ ] Mawar: Add timeline, treasure, handouts, and such as desired/needed

- [[Mawar Adventures]]. Started in DR 1747. Episodic campaign with minimal links between episodes and no firm conclusion, so potentially still active. Four episodes run so far. Fixed at level 6. Campaign directory has session notes but might need another pass to update things.

### One Shots

Single adventures, typically running between one and four sessions. 

#### Fully Canonical

- [ ] LL: Add landing page 
- [ ] LL: Add session 3 session notes
- [ ] LL: Add timeline (need to locate in time first)
- [ ] Oskar: Add directory with landing page
- [ ] Oskar: Add timeline (have this somewhere in old notes)
- [ ] Oskar: Add minimal session notes

- [[Labyrinths of the Lost ]]*(Finished, three sessions, level 2-3)*. Set sometime between the DR 1720s and 1740s, but not fully anchored in time. Campaign directory needs the final session notes to be added, and a better landing page. 
- Oskar's Travels. Episodic adventures featuring [[Oskar]] and companions. So far, have only run adventures set in and around Tharn Todor during Riswynn's first separation from the Dunmar Fellowship (Dunmar Frontier Sessions 17 - 37).  Three sessions, level 5. Campaign directory does not exist. 

%%NOTE: Oskar's Adventures are a little complicated. The motivation to run these was to (a) give Riswynn an excuse to level up while the rest of the party was doing other stuff, and (b) have a family game occasionally while there was not an active family campaign. Oskar - a dwarven ranger - is presumably still hanging out in Tharn Todor and this could become an episodic campaign, but I don't think it is that likely. While Oskar and Riswynn are canonical, some of the guest characters may not be. %%
#### Partially Canonical

Some details from Ausson's Crossing are in Worldbuilding/Campaigns/Ausson's Crossing Mini-Series. Notes from the Stone Titan Adventure exist only in OneNote; while session notes do not exist, Zoom recordings do so parsing these is possible. 

- Ausson's Crossing *(Finished, four sessions, level 7-8)*. Set in DR 1688. The high level setting, the basic plot arc, the major NPCs, and three of the four PCs are canonical, but other minor details are ambiguous, and the fourth PC was canonically not present (because the player reused him for Cleenseau game).
- Stone Titan Starter Adventure *(Finished, two sessions, level 5)*.  Set sometime during the Blood Years, possibly during the [[Sentinel Range War]] or the [[First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. The basic plot is canonical, but the details and the PCs are not necessarily. 

#### Not Canonical

- Informatics One Shot. Set in an ambiguous DR 1700s time frame, in the Sembara Highlands. Two sessions, finished. Level 2-3. Some notes exist in OneNote, based on a mismash of two published adventures. 
- Tollen One Shots. Not canonical, primarily because details are poorly recorded. Set in an ambiguous 1700s time frame. Two sessions (one D&D, one FATE), finished. Low level. Episode 1 is recorded and could be transcribed and made canonical. 
- Taelgar 2.0 Alexandria One Shot. Not canonical, although possibly canonical in an alternate timeline. Run in Alexandria in 2019, set in an alternate version of the Blood Years. GURPS rules, self-insert characters. Finished. Some notes might exist on paper.
