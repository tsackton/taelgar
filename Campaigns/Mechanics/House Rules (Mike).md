# Character Creation
In general, the rules from the 2024 Player's Handbook are used, with several notable changes.

a) Do not select a background.
b) Select a species from [[Species of Taelgar]]
c) Build your stats using the [[#Stats|rules below]]
d) Use [[Competencies]] to select your starting languages, tools, and other flavor. See [[Languages]] for information on starting languages. You may select any language although a good in-game explanation may be required for [[Languages#Exotic Languages|exotic]] or [[Languages#Extra-Planar Languages|extra-planar]] languages, as well as [[Languages#Halfling|halfling]], which is not as a rule taught to outsiders. 
e) Choose an Origin Feat as your starting feat. See [[#Feats]] for more rules about feats. 
## Stats
Stats are bought using the Point Buy mechanism. 

After completing point buy for stats, you may do the following:
* Add +2 to one stat and +1 to another OR add +1 to each of three stats
* Increase a single stat that is 8 or 9 to 10

In additional to Ability Score Increase/Feats that you get from your class or classes, you gain a +1 bonus to your primary stat at 4th (character) level, and another +1 bonus to your primary stat at 8th (character) level. If your class has more than one primary stat, you may choose which stat to increase and may choose a different stat at 4th and 8th level.

Primary stats are:

| Class     | Stat(s)                 | Default Spellcasting Stat | Default Fighting Stat |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Artifcier | Intelligence            | N/A                       | N/A                   |
| Barbarian | Strength                | N/A                       | N/A                   |
| Bard      | Spellcasting Stat       | Charisma                  | N/A                   |
| Cleric    | Spellcasting Stat       | Wisdom                    | N/A                   |
| Druid     | Spellcasting Stat       | Wisdom                    | N/A                   |
| Fighter   | Fighting Stat           | N/A                       | Strength              |
| Monk      | Dexterity, Wisdom       | N/A                       | N/A                   |
| Paladin   | Fighting Stat, Charisma | N/A                       | Strength              |
| Ranger    | Fighting Stat, Wisdom   | N/A                       | Dexterity             |
| Rogue     | Dexterity               | N/A                       | N/A                   |
| Sorcerer  | Spellcasting Stat       | Charisma                  | N/A                   |
| Warlock   | Spellcasting Stat       | Charisma                  | N/A                   |
| Wizard    | Spellcasting Stat       | Intelligence              | N/A                   |
If you have a feature that changes the stat you use for spell casting, or if you usually fight with weapons that derive bonuses from a different stat than the default, you can use these stats as your primary stat instead. 
# Feats
In general, the feats from the 2024 rules should be used instead of the older features, with homebrew and tweaks as appropriate. The following rules apply to all feats:
* No feats taken before 4th level can include an ability score increase. If there is a general feat that you would like to take as a starting feat that does include an ability score increase, I can homebrew an Origin Feat version of it
* All feats taken at 4th level or later include a +1 increase to an ability score, determined by the feat. If a feat does not include an ability score increase in the source rules, I will homebrew a version that does
# Wealth and Gold

Tracking small purchases and gold available at the individual gold piece level is not interesting. Instead, all player characters are assumed to have a small pool of accessible wealth that fluctuates over time. This is assumed to cover daily expenses, food, inns, and so on as well as small income, i.e. from performing or similar activities. In true need, a player can liquidate this wealth to gain 50 gold, but if that gold is spent wealth needs to be tracked on a daily level until that 50 gold is 'paid back'

Additionally, for flavor, numerous monetary systems exist (for example [[Coinage of Sembara]], [[Dunmari Economy#Coins|Coins of Dunmar]], or [[Dwarven Coins]]). However, tracking the conversion of many different types in a realistic way is a lot of needless math, and it prevents making "interesting" monetary systems that are not easily decimalized, but which were common historically. Therefore to simplify tracking of wealth, although a treasure horde might be described as "a large pile of Sembaran royals from the reign of Bertram I", I will also give you a value in "gold pieces" for tracking, and prices will be stated in "gold pieces". The term "gold pieces" shouldn't be thought of as a specific number of actual coins, but a notation of wealth. After all we are playing Dungeons and Dragons not Treasure Hordes and Accountants. 
## Spells

In order to simplify spell-casting, the following additional rules apply:
- All cleric, paladin, ranger, and bard spells have verbal components only, and can be cast without a free hand.
- Artificer, druid, warlock, sorcerer, and wizard spells follow the standard D&D rules, and require a free hand if they have somatic components.
- No spells have material components except the following (4th and under only, will update with higher level spells later)
	- Continual Flame (a gem worth 50 gold, which is consumed)
	- Glyph of Warding (powered diamond worth 200 gold, which is consumed)
	- Revivify (diamond worth 300 gold, which is consumed)
	- Illusory Script (ink worth 10 gold)
	- Arcane Lock (golden dust worth 25 gold)
- All casters can cast ritual spells. As a note, to cast a spell as a ritual it must be prepared or known.
## Mounted Combat

Mounted combat in D&D is a little bit unsatisfying but also designed for both simplicity and to ensure that a mounted combatant isn’t enormously more powerful than a non-mounted combatant. Here is a slight tweak to the mounted combat rules to try to keep most of the balance but make it a little bit more satisfying. 

When a mount is being ridden, the following rules apply:

- The mount acts on the same initiative count as its rider    
- The mount can move and take bonus actions as normal
- The mount may not take any actions other than Dash, Disengage, or Dodge
- The rider, when taking the Attack action, may choose to direct their mount to attack in place of their own attack. If the mount attacks, it may not take any other action  

When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against a mounted rider, they may choose whether to attack the mount or the rider. However, opportunity attacks do not apply to creatures that are moved by another creature or moved unwillingly. So this means that:

- If a mounted combatant withdraws from combat and their mount takes the Disengage action, neither mount nor rider can be targeted with an opportunity attack
- If a mounted combatant withdraws from combat and their mount does not take the Disengage action, either the mount or rider can be targeted
- There is no benefit to the rider taking the Disengage action 

#### Mounted Combatant Feat

The mounted combatant feat is changed as follows:

- You may, as a bonus action, direct their mount to attack or distract, allowing the mount to take either the Attack or Help actions    
- You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails

## Ranged Combat

As a reminder, several official rules we have not been consistent about that I will be trying to remember:
- Ranged attacks, including ranged spell attacks, have disadvantage if you are within 5’ of an enemy 
- Ranged attacks have disadvantage if you are outside the lower range of your weapon
- When targeted enemies with ranged attacks, including ranged spell attacks, if there are things in the way - including allies or other enemies - the target has half-cover (+2 to AC)
## Death and Dying

When a PC drops to 0 or fewer HP, you gain the dying condition. While you have the dying condition, the following rules apply: 

- You cannot take actions, reactions, or bonus actions
- Your speed is halved    
- You start each turn prone
- Attacks against you have advantage
- You have disadvantage on all saving throws
- At the end of your turn, if you did not take damage, you must make a DC 13 Constitution check. 
- If you fail the check, you fall unconscious. If you took damage, you also fall unconscious
- Each time you take damage while dying you suffer a wound

Once you are unconscious, you make a death saving throw each turn. On three successes, you stabilize. For each failure, you gain a wound. Once you reach 6 wounds, from a rules perspective what happens here is undefined, but in general:
- Further damage will usually result in death
- The passage of time will usually result in stabilization at 1 HP

#### Recovery from Dying

When a character regains hit points after being in the dying state, you also gain two levels of the wounded condition. Each long rest or magical healing for >50% of your hit points reduces your level of wounded by one. 
 
The effect of wounded is as follows:
* Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks
* Level 2: Speed is halved
* Level 3: Disadvantage on attack and saving throws
* Level 4: Hit point maximum halved. You cannot spend Hit Dice to regain hit points.
* Level 5: Speed is 0
* Level 6: Coma
#### NPCs and Monsters

For the vast majority of monsters and monstrous humanoids 0 HP means dead. If the plot dictates it is sensible for someone to survive, perhaps they will still be alive, but in general the default assumption is the creature dies at 0 HP. For most non-monstrous humanoids (i.e. humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk and other sentient creatures) I'll generally run 0 HP as badly wounded enough to be no longer useful on the battlefield, and let the plot and party actions dictate what exactly happens -- but usually emergency healing (magical or Medicine checks) would work to keep them alive.
