## Stoneborn Traits

As a Stoneborn, you have these special traits.

%% stoneborn design logic is a little different as it feels like there is room for a species with one major impactful ability and not necessarily a lot of minor abilities. this is similar to the phb 2024 goliath design, or the 2024 phb gnome design.  the goal is to make Entamba's Blessing a choice of powerful thematic "anime monk" kind of abilities but probably still needs balancing work.

still need one more feature probably besides blessing and powerful build...

#### Powerful Build
You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

#### Entamba's Blessing
As a Stoneborn, you can use your connection to Entamba to perform feats of strength, endurance, and mental stamina. You may select one of the following disciplines:

- Entamba's Body: You have resistance to Poison and Cold damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws against poison. 
- Entamba's Will: You have Advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. 
- Entamba's Strength: When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. You can use this effect a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 
- Entamba's Protection: When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

%% maybe could use one more option? %%
