## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Dwarves mature at a little more slowly than humans, and are not considered full adults until they reach their age of majority at 25 and make a pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain to receive their name and thuhr. Dwarves have a long lifespan, often reaching 350 year of age.
**Languages**: You may select four languages during character creation, which should usually include Dwarvish. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency.

## Dwarf Traits

As an Dwarf, you have these special traits.

%% dwarf design logic, taking the basic model of the PHB 2024 to be a species should consist of traits approximately the same value as (a) an origin feat, (b) a skill proficiency, and (c) a flavorful and situationally strong ability, but that species can vary a bit up or down from this for flavor

Enhanced Darkvision is slightly better than a skill
Stonecunning is fairly situational so on the weak side for (c)
Baharazel's blessing aiming to be roughly 1/2 an origin feat (e.g., two cantrips, or a cantrip + 1 feature, or a fairly strong feature)
Rune Crafting is slightly weaker than a choice of a 1st level spell, but benefits from scaling casting with prof bonus and ability to give to other people to use. The second feature means focus is on non-Concentration spells to prevent breaking Concentration limits, since you eventually can effectively cast a spell 3x times as once if you give your runes to your allies.
%%
#### Darkvision
You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

#### Stonecunning
As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching such a surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Thuhr
As adult dwarf, you belong to one of seven thuhr: Ruler, Runecrafter, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, Farmer. Your thuhr does not limit your choice of class or profession. Rather, it reflects your role and place in dwarven society. While your thuhr has no direct mechanical effects, if you wish to represent a typical life experience for a dwarf of your thuhr, you may select a special Background representing each thuhr.

>[!note] Binthuhr Dwarves
>If you are a binthuhr dwarf (a young dwarf who has not visited the Heart of the Mountain, or an adult who failed to complete their pilgrimage), you do not have a Thuhr, Baharezel's Blessing, or the Dwarven Rune Crafting trait. You may instead choose one 1st level feat to reflect your upbringing.

#### Bahrazel's Blessing
Your innate connection to the Bahrazel provides you with a supernatural blessing. Choose one of the following options: 
- *Tarbaka's Blessing of Craft.* You learn the Mending cantrip. In addition, you have an uncanny ability to understand raw materials and how to shape them. You gain proficiency in two Artisan's Tool of your choice. When you Craft items with your chosen Tools, you require only half the time and raw materials that would normally be required. %% Mending + parts of the Crafter feat, feels flavorful and situationally powerful as a source of income but probably not a major balance concern %%
- *Azar's Blessing of Resilience.* Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level. %% literally 1/2 of Tough feat, should be fine %%
- *Oshkir's Blessing of Aid.* You learn the Guidance and Spare the Dying cantrips. %% one great cantrip, one very situational cantrip %%
- *Karthel's Blessing of Shaping.* You learn two cantrips from among Elementalism, Shape Water, Mold Earth, Gust, Control Flames, Thaumaturgy, or Light. %% two cantrips %%
- *Maganna's Blessing of Communication.* You learn the Message cantrip. You also gain proficiency in one additional languages, and whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can pray to Maganna allowing you to exchange this language proficiency for another language. %% cantrip + language ability. feel like a swappable on long rest language is potentially more interesting/flavorful than just 3 proficiencies, although I could go either way %%
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore.* You learn the Identify spell. You can cast this spell at will, but only as a ritual. If you cast this spell as a ritual, it does not require material components. %% 1st level spell, fairly straightforward %%
- *Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership.* When you finish a Long Rest, you can inspire your allies with a rousing speech, granting Heroic Inspiration to a number of your companions equal to your Proficiency Bonus. %% a worse version of Musician, probably balanced but not sure how I feel about just duplicating existing feats (although I guess you just wouldn't take this option if you were planning on taking Musician). alternative ideas: grant temp hp equal to PB to all allies after short or long rest (maybe too weak? also just a worse form of Inspiring Leader so same problem);%%

**Dwarven Rune Crafting.** As an adult dwarf who has completed your pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain, you gain an innate ability to use runes to create magical effects, drawing power from your connection to the Bahrâzel. When you complete a Long Rest, you can inscribe or create a number of tokens bearing a rune equal to half your Proficiency Modifier (rounded up). Each rune can be used once to create a magical effect, after which the rune fades. You may choose Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or Constitution as your ability score for rune effects.

- Rune of Defense: Sanctuary
- Rune of Delving: Create or Destroy Water
- Rune of Exploration: Longstrider
- Rune of Lore: Fanrukel's Insight*
- Rune of Valor: Heroism (when cast from this rune, this spell does not require Concentration)
- Rune of Stone: Locate Stone or Ore*
- Rune of the Forge: Tarbaka's Flame Ward*
- Rune of Life: Goodberry

%% general thoughts / concerns
- Sanctuary, Longstrider, and Heroism seem fine: flavorful, not overly strong but remain useful at all levels. Not sure about removing Concentration from Heroism. Could instead make a custom Heroism that adds temp hp and gives advantage on frightened instead of immune to frightened.
- Goodberry might be too strong early and too weak late, as multiple castings have strongly diminishing value. I kind of like the flavor though since it creates a mechanism for deep exploration and for limited food production capabilities of underground cities. 
- Create or Destroy Water might be too situational, although also is kind of useful from a worldbuilding perspective to allow easy underground exploration as long as you have one Rune of Delving dwarf and one Rune of Life dwarf
- Fanrukel's Insight feels a little weak, even with the buffs (below), but fits a very different niche so is probably fine
- Locate Stone or Ore is probably fine, although potentially annoying to DM for. Debated the "significant" limit but being able to detect every coin within 1000 feet is either useless (in a city) or overpowered (in a  humanoid dungeon where inhabitants carry coins)
- Tarbaka's Flame Ward is IMO significantly worse than just "fire resistance" even with the ability to share it. Hard to tell if too weak or two strong. Could be rebalanced by (a) increasing duration to 1 hour and requiring you to use your Bonus Action in advance to gain Fire Resistance until the end of your next turn, or (b) allowing Reaction to grant resistance not just to triggering damage but all fire damage until start of your next turn, or (c) treating it like Evasion but specifically for spells that do fire damage (probably too situational). 

As far as number - eight seems enough but this leaves out from the old dwarf Truth and Aid. In part because I couldn't think of obvious options for those. Truth could I guess use a debuffed Zone of Truth but not sure what that would be (save once, if succeed immune to spell? single target only?). The Aid spell is too strong for Aid,  and didn't have any other obvious ideas. 
%%
#### Fanrukel's Insight
**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you take the Study action and fail on the d20 Test
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You can reroll the d20, adding your spellcasting modifier to the roll in addition to any normal modifiers that apply to the check. If you roll less than 10 on the new roll, treat the roll as a 10. 
#### Locate Metal or Stone
**Casting Time:** 1 Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Describe or name a specific type of ore, gemstone, metal, native element, or natural stone. You learn the distance and direction of the most significant instance of the named material within 1000 feet.

#### Tarbaka's Flame Ward
**Casting Time:** 1 Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M
**Duration:** 10 minutes

One of your appendages becomes immune to fire damage. While this effect is active, you can use your Reaction when you take Fire damage to gain resistance to the triggering damage.
