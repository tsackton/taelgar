## Character Creation

*Follow the rules listed in the 2024 PHB, with the following modifications.*

**Chose a Background:** If you cannot find an official background that fits your class, talk to me to homebrew something. 

**Choose a Species:** The species available to play in the world of Taelgar are listed [[Species of Taelgar|here]].

**Choose Languages:** Unless your species says otherwise, every player character starts with four languages. One of these should probably be Common, and a second should usually be the language spoken most frequently in the region of the world your adventure or campaign is set. The other two are free for you to choose, from [[Languages|these options]]. You are free to replace one language with a tool proficiency, if you desire. 

**Determine Ability Scores:** Use Point Cost as your option to generate ability scores. 

>[!info]+ D&D Beyond
> When you make your character in D&D Beyond, follow these guidelines:
> 1. On the Home screen, select Homebrew and Expanded Rules (but not Legacy) in Sources. 
> 2. On the species page, if your chosen species is listed as "Homebrew" in the species table, Filter Species Source(s) to Homebrew. The current versions of species should be grouped under the species icon and named simply Elf, Dwarf, etc instead of Elf (Taelgar) or Dwarf (Taelgar)
