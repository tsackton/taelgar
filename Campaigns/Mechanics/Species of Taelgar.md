# Species of Taelgar

Taelgar is a world inhabited by many diverse species, many of which are appropriate options for player characters. The following species, described in brief, are well-known by most people in Taelgar. Species that are player options are marked with a ******* .
### Standard Species

There are 13 species that most anyone on Taelgar has likely heard of, although most common people of the world will likely have only met a few non-humans, unless they live in a large, cosmopolitan city. 

****Humans***: The most numerous species on Taelgar, humans are adaptable and resilient. They have spread across the world, inventing diverse languages, religions, and cultures in the process. 

****Elves***: The first of the [[Elder Folk]] to walk the world, elves have a deep connection to magic and nature through their connection their gods, [[Aldanor]], the Living Tree and [[Elmerca]], the Wild Star. Their culture and society is strongly shaped by the [[Elven Cycle of Generations|ka]], a unique cycle system of non-overlapping generations arising from elves' extremely long lifespans but limited time when they can bear children. These days, elves are rarely seen among human cities, and many common folk will have never met one.

****Dwarves***: One of the [[Elder Folk]], dwarves make their homes beneath the mountains of Taelgar, carving great halls of stone and light beneath the earth, aided by their innate runic magic from their connection to their gods, the [[Bahrazel]]. Their culture and society are shaped by ties of kinship and clan, and by the mystical bonds of their thuhr, a uniquely dwarven combination of guild, secret society, and found family. Dwarves are often found in human realms, as travelers, visitors, and long-term residents. 

****Halflings***: The most numerous of the [[Elder Folk]], halflings are wanderers and travelers, merchants and sailors, storytellers and poets. Though many halflings are nomadic, and rarely settle in one place for long, they are deeply connected to each other by a unique ancestral consciousness mediated by their gods, the [[First Ones]], which allows them to communicate telepathically and remember fragments of their ancestors' knowledge and lives. Halflings, while not as numerous as humans, are frequent sights across the realms of many species of Taelgar.

### Unusual Species

Legends and rumors speak of other, stranger species in the world of Taelgar. Sailors tell tales of  merfolk who live beneath the waves, dwarves mutter about the brain-eating mind flayers that hide deep underground, and legends speak of larger than life giants who build massive fortresses with ancient magic. Few of these species are playable options in Taelgar, but three exceptions are detailed below. These options are not appropriate for all campaigns, and people of these species will often be greeted with fear, suspicious, and disbelief. 

****Plane-touched***: Very rarely, some humans are born with an unusual soul, touched by the powers of another plane. Perhaps this is one of the elemental planes, one of the realms of the divine, or a primordial spiritual realm. These people can sometimes hide their plane-touched souls, and live normal lives, but other times are born with obvious physical attributes of the plane.

****Gnomes***: Long ago, before the Downfall, many dwarves left their underground homes, fleeing the dangers of the underdark that crept into the world from cracks in multiverse, settling in empty places in the distant corners of the world. Over the centuries, as they adopted to their new aboveground homes, they forged a new identity for themselves, calling themselves gnomes. 

****Free Orcs***: Rumors speak of some orcs that have escaped the divine bonds that chain them to the will of Thark, the god of endless war. Free from the influence of their god, these orcs chart their own path in Taelgar, although usually seek to live hidden from others in isolated communities, both to avoid the wrath of Thark and to avoid the anger and fear of other peoples.

### Dwarf

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Dwarves mature at a little more slowly than humans, and are not considered full adults until they reach their age of majority at 25 and make a pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain to receive their name and thuhr. Dwarves have a long lifespan, often reaching 350 year of age.
**Languages**: You may select four languages during character creation, which should usually include Dwarvish. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency.

**Darkvision.** You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

**Stonecunning.** As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching such a surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Thuhr.** As adult dwarf, you belong to one of seven thuhr: Ruler, Runecrafter, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, Farmer. Your thuhr does not limit your choice of class or profession. Rather, it reflects your role and place in dwarven society. While your thuhr has no direct mechanical effects, if you wish to represent a typical life experience for a dwarf of your thuhr, you may select a special Background representing each thuhr.

>[!note] Binthuhr Dwarves
>If you are a binthuhr dwarf (a young dwarf who has not visited the Heart of the Mountain, or an adult who failed to complete their pilgrimage), you do not have a Thuhr, Baharezel's Blessing, or the Dwarven Rune Crafting trait. You may instead choose one 1st level feat to reflect your upbringing.

**Bahrazel's Blessing.** Your innate connection to the Bahrazel provides you with a supernatural blessing. Choose one of the following options: 
- *Tarbaka's Blessing of Craft.* You learn the Mending cantrip. In addition, you have an uncanny ability to understand raw materials and how to shape them. You gain proficiency in two Artisan's Tool of your choice. When you Craft items with your chosen Tools, you require only half the time and raw materials that would normally be required.
- *Azar's Blessing of Strength.* Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level. 
- *Oshkir's Blessing of Aid.* You learn the Guidance and Spare the Dying cantrips. 
- *Karthel's Blessing of Shaping.* You learn two cantrips from among Elementalism, Shape Water, Mold Earth, Gust, Control Flames, Thaumaturgy, or Light.
- *Maganna's Blessing of Communication.* You learn the Message cantrip. You also gain proficiency in 3 additional languages.
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore.* You learn the Identify spell. You can cast this spell at will, but only as a ritual. If you cast this spell as a ritual, it does not require material components. 
- *Uzdan's Blessing of *


- [[Uzdan]] (he/him), the Ruler, the patron of those who lead, whether armies or kingdoms, and worshipped as the first king of the dwarves


**Dwarven Rune Crafting.** As an adult dwarf who has completed your pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain, you gain an innate ability to use runes to create magical effects, drawing power from your connection to the Bahrâzel. When you complete a Long Rest, you can inscribe or create a number of tokens bearing a rune equal to half your Proficiency Modifier (rounded up). Each rune can be used once to create a magical effect, after which the rune fades. You may choose Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or Constitution as your ability score for rune effects.

- Rune of Defense: Protection from Good and Evil
- Rune of Delving:
- Rune of Exploration: Find Traps. When you cast this spell with this rune, you are able to detect the exact location of any traps detected by the spell.
- Rune of Lore: Fanrukel's Insight*
- Rune of Valor: Heroism
- Rune of Stone: Locate Stone or Ore*
- Rune of the Forge:

When the bearer of the rune makes a ability check that uses the Arcana, History, or Religion skills (or related Knowledge competencies), and rolls a 9 or lower on the d20, they can activate this rune to treat the number rolled as a 10. Once this effect is activated, it cannot be used until the rune is inscribed again. The number of uses increases to two at 5th level and three at 11th level.


### Lizardfolk

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 8-10 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their third century, but few live beyond 300 years.

As a Lizardfolk, you have these special traits.

**Aquatic Adaptations:** You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes at at time.

**Natural Armor:** You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

**Ancestral Aid:** You can reach your ancestors through the magic of the Tharzen Anzinakoa and beseech them for aid. You always have the Augury spell prepared. *When you reach character level 5*, you always have the Borrowed Knowledge spell prepared. You can cast each spell you gain with this trait once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

**Prophetic Vision**: Your affinity for the dreamworld allows you to briefly see a moment ahead in time. If you fail a d20 Test, you can roll 1d4 and add the result to the d20, potentially changing a failure into a success. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
