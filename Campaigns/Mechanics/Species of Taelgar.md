# Species of Taelgar

Taelgar is a world inhabited by many diverse species, many of which are appropriate options for player characters. The following species, described in brief, are well-known by most people in Taelgar. Species that are player options are marked with a ******* .
### Standard Species

There are 13 species that most anyone on Taelgar has likely heard of, although most common people of the world will likely have only met a few non-humans, unless they live in a large, cosmopolitan city. 

****Humans***: The most numerous species on Taelgar, humans are adaptable and resilient. They have spread across the world, inventing diverse languages, religions, and cultures in the process. 

****Elves***: The first of the [[Elder Folk]] to walk the world, elves have a deep connection to magic and nature through their connection their gods, [[Aldanor]], the Living Tree and [[Elmerca]], the Wild Star. Their culture and society is strongly shaped by the [[Elven Cycle of Generations|ka]], a unique cycle system of non-overlapping generations arising from elves' extremely long lifespans but limited time when they can bear children. These days, elves are rarely seen among human cities, and many common folk will have never met one.

****Dwarves***: One of the [[Elder Folk]], dwarves make their homes beneath the mountains of Taelgar, carving great halls of stone and light beneath the earth, aided by their innate runic magic from their connection to their gods, the [[Bahrazel]]. Their culture and society are shaped by ties of kinship and clan, and by the mystical bonds of their thuhr, a uniquely dwarven combination of guild, secret society, and found family. Dwarves are often found in human realms, as travelers, visitors, and long-term residents. 

****Halflings***: The most numerous of the [[Elder Folk]], halflings are wanderers and travelers, merchants and sailors, storytellers and poets. Though many halflings are nomadic, and rarely settle in one place for long, they are deeply connected to each other by a unique ancestral consciousness mediated by their gods, the [[First Ones]], which allows them to communicate telepathically and remember fragments of their ancestors' knowledge and lives. Halflings, while not as numerous as humans, are frequent sights across the realms of many species of Taelgar.

### Unusual Species

Legends and rumors speak of other, stranger species in the world of Taelgar. Sailors tell tales of  merfolk who live beneath the waves, dwarves mutter about the brain-eating mind flayers that hide deep underground, and legends speak of larger than life giants who build massive fortresses with ancient magic. Few of these species are playable options in Taelgar, but three exceptions are detailed below. These options are not appropriate for all campaigns, and people of these species will often be greeted with fear, suspicious, and disbelief. 

****Plane-touched***: Very rarely, some humans are born with an unusual soul, touched by the powers of another plane. Perhaps this is one of the elemental planes, one of the realms of the divine, or a primordial spiritual realm. These people can sometimes hide their plane-touched souls, and live normal lives, but other times are born with obvious physical attributes of the plane.

****Gnomes***: Long ago, before the Downfall, many dwarves left their underground homes, fleeing the dangers of the underdark that crept into the world from cracks in multiverse, settling in empty places in the distant corners of the world. Over the centuries, as they adopted to their new aboveground homes, they forged a new identity for themselves, calling themselves gnomes. 

****Free Orcs***: Rumors speak of some orcs that have escaped the divine bonds that chain them to the will of Thark, the god of endless war. Free from the influence of their god, these orcs chart their own path in Taelgar, although usually seek to live hidden from others in isolated communities, both to avoid the wrath of Thark and to avoid the anger and fear of other peoples.
