# Stoneborn Species Details


The [[Stoneborn]] in Taelgar are a reclusive species. They tend to live in isolated communities in extreme environments, especially high in the mountains, although they are not unheard of in human and dwarven settlements. They are also noted in the world of Taelgar as master artisans, skilled in many trades. It is not uncommon for individual [[Stoneborn]] to spend decades, or even a century, honing their craft.

## Creating Your Stoneborn Character



To make a [[Stoneborn]] adventurer, consider why you left your community. Perhaps you are a rare member of your species born among other sentient beings, in a human city, or among dwarves, or even elves. Maybe you left your home on a personal mission, or on a mission for your clan. Maybe a tragedy -- or a personal mistake -- forced you to leave.

%% stoneborn design logic is a little different as it feels like there is room for a species with one major impactful ability and not necessarily a lot of minor abilities. this is similar to the phb 2024 goliath design, or the 2024 phb gnome design.  the goal is to make Entamba's Blessing a choice of powerful thematic "anime monk" kind of abilities but probably still needs balancing work.

still need one more feature probably besides blessing and powerful build...

#### Powerful Build
You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

#### Entamba's Blessing
As a Stoneborn, you can use your connection to Entamba to perform feats of strength, endurance, and mental stamina. You may select one of the following disciplines:

- Entamba's Body: You have resistance to Poison and Cold damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws against poison. 
- Entamba's Will: You have Advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. 
- Entamba's Strength: When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. You can use this effect a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 
- Entamba's Protection: When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

%% maybe could use one more option? %%


%% old option from previous iteration:
- _Entamba's Dance (Sandborn only):_ You learn to mimic the shifting sands and blowing winds of your desert home. Your base movement speed increases to 35 feet. In addition, when a creature targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature's attacks against you to be rolled with disadvantage until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after you finish a short or a long rest.
