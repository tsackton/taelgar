# Chronicles of the Silver Tempests Ascendant

Fresh off their victory over the hag [[Morgana Stoneclaw]], the party, now calling themselves the [[Silver Tempests]], finds themselves facing some of the more terrible monsters of the land. While returning to [[Voltara]], they learn a black [[Dragons|dragon]] is disrupting the [[Northern Provinces]], causing conflict between the [[~Voltara East Border Fort~]] and a local [[Bullywugs|bullywug]] population. Proving their growing power, the [[Silver Tempests]] kill the dragon, [[Nymthrax]], and loot the riches of its lair. Returning to [[Voltara]], they leave to explore the ruins far beneath [[Goldpeak Mountain]], (re)uniting with some Chardonian explorers and finding the lair of a beholder, [[Vilaxes]]. Defeating the beholder, the [[Silver Tempests]] return to [[Voltara]], extremely wealthy and in need a long break, during which [[Brelith]] opens a restaurant and retires. Their break is interrupted, however, by the arrival of [[Mabist]] with the news that [[Dinia]] has been captured by the [[Havoc Host]]. The [[Silver Tempests]] ride forth in anger, freeing [[Dinia]] from the control of an aboleth, [[Ithu’rax]], near the village of [[Suwi]]. 

## Adventure 17: What do you mean, we have to kill a dragon?!?

### Session 51, part 2

After a few weeks, the party leaves to return to [[Voltara]]. On the way, [[Adrik]] turns to a werebear and must be knocked unconscious. [[Brelith]] cures him the next morning.

After defeating were-[[Adrik]], the party arrives at a [[~Voltara East Border Fort~|Chardonian fort]] on the border of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. [[Samso]] convinces [[Soria Caronius]], the commander of the fort, that the party are amazing heroes who can turn into dragons and kill deadly enemies with a glance, so she insists they try to find out who is stealing all their cattle. Their first scouting attempt fails miserably.

### Session 52

After regrouping, the party heads upriver and discovers a small [[bullywugs|bullywug]] village, that appears to have been stealing the Chardonian cattle. The party attacks and nearly wipes out the entire [[~Bullywug Village~|village]] before realizing that perhaps they should have talked first. After some limited communication with drawings and diagrams – and the threat of a giant froghemoth potentially attacking them – they realize the [[bullywugs]] were driven from their home by a [[Dragons|dragon]]. The bullywugs communicate that if the dragon is killed, all will be forgiven.

### Session 53

The party returns to the [[~Voltara East Border Fort~|Chardonian fort]] and leaves the problem of the nearly-exterminated bullwugs in the [[Soria Caronius|commander]]’s hands, and heads north to track the [[Dragons|dragon]]. Along the way, after about a week’s journey upriver, they meet some [[Deno'qai]], who are gathered at a council to discuss what to do about the very same dragon. 

After some discussion with the [[Deno'qai]] council, the party decides to travel with [[Izkir]], a priest of [[Bita]], a bear spirit, who will lead them to the lair. After almost 10 days, they come to the edge of the [[Blackwater Fens]], where the dragon lair is.

### Session 54

The party sets off into the [[Blackwater Fens]], with [[Adrik]] leading the way and [[Samso]] keeping an eye out for danger. They pass an ancient stone marker, about 60’ high, marking friendship between the elves and the humans, but it has fallen on its side. Continuing into the swamp, they make camp for the night.

In the middle of the night, the [[Nymthrax|dragon]], scouting its territory, finds them, and surprises the camp with a blast of its acid breath. While perched on a tree and taunting them, demanding they join its service or die, [[Adrik]] and [[Aelar]] manage to get on top of it, and are hasted by [[Izkir]]’s magic. As they beat on the dragon from above – and an attempted polymorph of [[Aelar]] into a T-rex is less successful than hoped – the dragon takes to the air, watching the spellcasters and attempting to disruption their concentration. Still, [[Adrik]] and [[Aelar]] do considerable damage before [[Samso]]’s conjured air elemental turns against the party as he falls unconscious, and [[Nymthrax]] flees, wounded.

Rather than attempt to rest here, where the dragon is alerted to their presence, the party hikes overnight to the [[~Blackwater Fens Stone Marker~|stone monument]], and spends the day repairing it using the plan suggested by the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]], at [[Brelith]]’s questioning with the Divination spell. With the monument restored, the party finally rests safely. 

The next day is spent scrying and scouting, trying to assess the situation before heading for the lair to attack and kill the dragon. 

### Session 55

The party makes a plan and finally confronts [[Nymthrax]] in his lair. The battle is fiercely fought, and the party is nearly killed by the searing acid of his breath. However, in the dragon’s moment of triumph, with everyone but [[Brelith]] unconscious on the battlefield, [[Brelith]] summons lightning to strike down the dragon. 

The party then loots [[Nymthrax's Hoard|his hoard]], finding a vast collection of art, gems, coin, and treasure from throughout history. 

### Session 56

The party spends a considerable amount of time organizing treasure and figuring out how to transport the entire hoard. With that accomplished, they head south, saying goodbye to [[Izkir]], and then meeting again with the [[bullywugs]] to tell them their home is safe and return some treasure the dragon stole from them. 

A few weeks later, they arrive back in [[Voltara]], greeting by [[Julius of Voltara|Julius]], their steward.

## Adventure 18: What’s at the Bottom of that Vast, Dark Chasm?
### Session 57

The party spends some time in [[Voltara]]. They sell treasure, decorate their manor, and purchase an extradimensional vault from an [[Eldeth Redhammer|eccentric dwarven artificer]]. They also receive letters: 
- from [[Dinia]], saying that [[Airion’s Tower]] is gone; 
- from [[Iara]], the lizardfolk, saying her people are heading south to [[Lake Valandros]]; 
- from Archivist [[Lyra]], saying that the elemental scrolls were well-received, that should they find any more of Arion’s treasure they should come to [[Chardon]] to sell it, and also asking if they would look into the disappearance of another group of adventurers in the [[Goldpeak Mine]]s. 

With their treasure protected by magic and with [[Julius of Voltara|Julius]] paid and the manor restocked, the party heads out to [[Goldpeak Mines]], where they find a mysterious abandoned camp with dead bodies.

### Session 58

Hearing noises from the tent at the abandoned camp, [[Samso]] lights the fabric on fire, which is encouraged to spread by [[Adrik]]’s ability to control flames. As the fire burns, a dwarf emerges but quickly dissolves into a pair of gibbering mouthers. The party fights them, and the tentacled rats that emerge from the dead bodies of a pair of horses. Despite [[Adrik]]’s mind being frequently overcome by the gibbering whispers calling out to [[Vilaxes]], the party defeats these creatures and heads into the [[Goldpeak Mines|mines]]. Easily descending the cliff walls, the party finds a ruined ladder of massive, thick braided rope at the bottom. Charging ahead into a rough-hewn passage, [[Adrik]] is attacked and ambushed by a cloaker, which summons two carrion crawlers to aid it. Despite its annoying grapple, the cloaker is driven off, and the carrion crawlers are killed by [[Aelar]] as they try to flee. 

### Session 59

The [[Silver Tempests ]]continue down the passage, finding a campfire with the surviving Chardonians: [[Alton]], the halfling rogue from long ago, and [[Cassia]], a human paladin. They claim that some weird aberrations are living in the depths; [[Brottor|their companion]], a dwarf, was corrupted and went mad. After a rest, the party joins [[Cassia]] and [[Alton]] to explore further. 

After traveling some distance into the depths, the party finds some guards, twisted tentacled horrors watching the passageway. Between [[Samso]]’s wall of thorns and [[Brelith]]’s shatter spell, combined with the usual strength of the melee fighters, the guards die quickly. But it does not matter that the guards do not sound the alarm, as shatter alerts the base anyway. 

Entering the lair, [[Brelith]] falls into a quicksand trap and needs most of the rest of the party to rescue him; [[Aelar]] is left free to run up the wall and chase down some kobolds who are watching. One of the kobolds is pretending to be an acolyte of the fire god, and speaks freely to the party when he realizes they were the instigators of that con. From him, they learn that a beholder has taken over the kobold den, driving them to make a massive statue to his glory. 

Sneaking through the lair, the party encounters a few guards, attempting to trick them into believing they are here to worship [[Vilaxes]], the beholder. This fails, and [[Adrik]], [[Brelith]], [[Cassia]], and [[Samso]] are quickly chained and tossed into pits. [[Aelar]] and [[Alton]], hidden, follow, and then launch an attack on the guards. A fight ensues, during which everyone escapes from their pits. 

The party confronts the beholder [[Vilaxes]] in a massive cavern dominated by a huge statue of a beholder walking on two legs, made of precious metals, random dungeon detritus, and broken weapons and armor. The fight seems to be going badly, with [[Aelar]] and [[Alton]] charmed, and [[Adrik]] and [[Cassia]] about to succumb to petrification, when [[Adrik]] uses a wish to remove all status effects from the party. Hoping to keep the beholder’s attention in his earth elemental form, [[Samso]] begins attacking the statue, cracking it in half, and drawing the beholder’s rage. While [[Samso]] is the focus of every blast of magic, and eventually succumbs to the death ray, [[Adrik]] strikes down [[Vilaxes]] with [[Thunderbrand]]. [[Brelith]] is then able to quickly cast revivify, bringing [[Samso]] back from the dead, and later restore [[Cassia]] as well. 

### Session 60

Back in [[Voltara]], the [[Silver Tempests]] enjoys the rewards of their status and reputation. [[Brelith]] apprentices himself to the chef at [[Finoc Small]]’s tavern, [[The Wandering Toad]], learning to cook, and opening a restaurant, [[Cleric Cooks]]. [[Adrik]] goes on a binge of pit fighting and gambling, managing to end up with a small profit. [[Samso]] travels to visit with [[Iara]] at the [[lizardfolk]] community near [[Lake Valandros]], and learns more about the mysterious attacks. [[Alton]] opens a boisterous tavern and dive bar outside the city walls, called the [[Rogue’s Range]], with axe throwing for patrons. 

Four months later, the [[Silver Tempests]] host a party, a grand opening for [[Cleric Cooks]]. Many old friends are there, thanks to [[Samso]]’s new magic ability to teleport via plants: [[Dinia]], from the north; [[Brelith]]’s parents and some other dwarves of [[Zarkandur]]; and [[Aris]] and some other centaurs, who are leaving on the next stop in their migration and have come to say goodbye. It is a big success.

## Adventure 19: Saving Grandma Yoda (This Shit’s Kinda’ Fishy)

### Session 61

[[Mabist]] comes knocking on the door of the [[Tempest Towers]]. Both [[Samso]] and [[Adrik]] are a bit suspicious of this armored visitor before we learn [[Dinia]] was captured. We retrieve [[Alton]] from his violent dive bar. In misty forms the party flies to [[Suwi]], a distant village near the coast, where they meet the [[~Suwi Village Priest~|village priest]], and ask about rumors of the [[Havoc Host]], a mercenary group that was involved in kidnapping [[Dinia]]. The priest introduces the party to [[Clara]], a teenaged girl whose brother was kidnapped a few days ago by the [[Havoc Host]], just upriver near a small lake.

The next morning the party travels upriver to the [[~North Bay Coast Lake~|lake]]. Finding the logging camp where [[~Clara's Brother~|Clara’s brother]] was taken, they follow a trail along the lakeshore, coming to a rocky clearing where the ruins of a castle overlook the lake. The party manages to ambush a group of slimy minions, and quickly dispatch them, knocking them out and binding them. 

Searching the ruins, [[Samso]] finds a concealed tunnel leading underground. Following the tunnel, the party emerges into the barracks of the [[Havoc Host]]. [[Mabist]] is disguised as a slimy minion; [[Samso]] turns into an earth elemental; and [[Adrik]] busts down the door. A battle ensues, in which the [[Havoc Host]] are soundly beaten. Convinced that [[Mabist]] is one of the [[Ithu’rax]]’s servants, the mercenaries are reluctant to surrender, until [[Mabist]] attempts to surrender himself, convincing them that something strange is going on. At this point, the mercenaries surrender, and are disarmed and convinced to make a better life for themselves opening a franchise of Brelith’s restaurant by [[Adrik]] and [[Mabist]]. 

The party learns the layout of the tunnels from the mercenaries, and begins to explore, carefully navigating around cracking parts of the tunnels that drop rocks on their heads with a misstep. After navigating through the tunnels for some time, [[Samso]] hears sobbing from a room to the south. Here, the party discovers the dead body of an adventurer, and the ghost of [[Milo Kentbrush]], who was sure he could kill the aboleth, but was ambushed by the annoying slime servants. The party finds his arrow of aberration slaying, and takes it with them. Milo follows, tied to the arrow.

The party manages to quietly navigate the flooded caverns, emerging into the aboleth’s lair, where they see a psychically controlled [[Dinia]] waiting for them. She attacks, and [[Ithu’rax]] the aboleth emerges from a central pool, joining the battle. The battle is a challenge. [[Ithu’rax ]]manipulates his foes physical form, turning ligaments to jelly and lungs to gills, all of which make it difficult for the party to land a blow. [[Alton]], although set up with the arrow of aboleth slaying, misses his shot; [[Mabist]] manages to grapple the aboleth with a giant force hand, but is targeted by the aboleth’s anger and eventually knocked unconscious and dropped into the cursed waters at the center of the cave. [[Samso]] spends the combat as an earth elemental; while he does not sustain much damage, he is also repeatedly driven back and unable to land a solid blow. It is only [[Samso]]’s conjured dragon, and [[Adrik]]’s seemingly endless ability to absorb the strikes of the aboleth’s tentacles, that save the party and lead to victory. 

With the aboleth killed, [[Dinia]] returns to herself, and appoints herself the caretaker of the now slowly recovering slime servants.
