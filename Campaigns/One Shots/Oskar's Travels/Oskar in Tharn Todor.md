## Episode 1: The Sleeping Aboleth

Riswynn meets Oskar and Agnor at the [[The Red Shield]], a tavern owned by [[Oskar]]'s family in [[Tharn Todor]], to discuss news from [[Bailon]], the forewoman of one of the deep mines beneath the city. She reports that several of her dwarves are trapped, and she is hoping that [[Oskar]] and his companions will investigate. Descending deep below the city, [[Oskar]] and his companions find a strange chamber, where they defeat a haunted slime creature, discover the ancient remains of the aboleth Xeron, now content to slumber undisturbed, and rescue most of the lost dwarves.

He tells [[Riswynn]] and [[Oskar]] about a cloud of black smoke and ash that now hangs over the mountain, and dreams of a fire spreading from the mountain and consuming the land below, as a red hand reaching up from cracks in the ground. Worse, a few days ago a wounded creature staggered down the mountain, warning of a ritual to summon a servant of an ancient evil from beyond this world.

The next morning, [[Riswynn]] and [[Oskar]] set out for the mountains, heading to [[Ken-to]]'s hut. They speak with the wounded creature, and then head into the mountains where they fight and defeat a devil, attempting to complete a summoning ritual.
