The party pushes deeper into Zeyfa’s Labyrinth, surviving a warm crevasse and worsening storm, questioning a dead man from [[Melusa]], and emerging into a black‑stone chamber where a shaggy white beast appears.

## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1730-01-25), afternoon:** The party explores deeper into Zeyfa’s Labyrinth as the maze shifts around them, then spills into a black‑stone chamber where a beast waits.

## Cast of Characters

- **[[Jrain Fanlish]]** – Brevan scout and woodswalker, leading the party’s navigation and keeping them moving.
- **[[Finnan Oakstride]]** – halfling bard and collector of stories, mapping the maze and drawing lore from memory and magic.
- **[[Justas Rhostrin]]** – veteran devoted to the [[Kestavo]], anchoring the group with stubborn resolve and healing.
- **[[Ekko]]** – kenku druid of [[Kemeko Monastery]], reading the winds and turning to primal magic to survive the labyrinth’s traps.
- **[[Eolo]]** – young kenku warrior, bold and unflinching in the maze’s tight quarters.
- **[[Kalima]]** – terrified woman from [[Melusa]], wounded by the labyrinth’s violence and desperate to turn back.
- **Rala** – Jrain’s avian companion, used for scouting ahead through tunnels and chambers. 
- **Unnamed man of [[Melusa]]** – a corpse trapped in ice, questioned with *Speak with Dead*.
- **[[Zeyfa]]** – the cruel West Wind, whose labyrinth twists to pen the party in.
- **Melua** – a kestavo name remembered in Finnan’s old Teft‑travel stories, possibly tied to [[Melusa]].

## Places

- **Zeyfa’s Labyrinth** – the ice‑and‑stone maze whose geometry shifts under storm and booming pulses.
- **[[Melusa]]** – a cliff‑carved village named by the dead, described as enduring on fish and fog, bound to sacrifice.
- **[[Great Chasm]]** – referenced as a point of comparison for storms, stone, and the feeling of “depth.”
- **[[Teft]]** – river tied to Finnan’s remembered stories of a waterfall shrine.

## Narrative Summary

Our session begins as, drawn onward by the shifting geometry of Zeyfa’s Labyrinth, the party descends from the entrance chamber into tight, snowy tunnels of stone and hoarfrost, trying to keep their bearings as wind gusts swirl and passages fork unpredictably. In a low, ice-walled chamber split by a warm crevasse fringed with ice “ferns,” they test the depths with a lighted snowball, only to watch the light abruptly vanish, feel the wind and snow thicken, and struggle to get everyone across as [[Kalima]] pleads to turn back. Pressing forward, they find a human corpse pinned by ice and use *Speak with Dead* to learn of [[Melusa]], a cliff-carved village that offers sacrifices to [[Zeyfa]]; the dead insists the labyrinth does not let anyone escape, while Finnan’s Memory of the Ancestors links [[Melusa]] to old stories of a waterfall shrine along the [[Teft]] tied to a kestavo called [[Melua]].

The storm worsens into whiteout as ice seems to grow beneath their feet and the maze rearranges itself around booming pulses and shadowy wind-creatures that sweep through open rooms. Kalima is injured in the chaos and becomes even more fearful of being carried by the kenku, while the party relies on rope, stealth, and spells to keep moving through narrowing choices and vanishing exits. Eventually, a right-hand tunnel of hanging ice veils becomes a trap: Ekko’s *Create Bonfire* shatters the ice and triggers a collapse: an avalanche-like surge, forcing the party to leap into darkness and slide down slick, non-reflective black ice. They spill out into a quiet black-stone chamber with sheer ice walls, just in time for Kalima to warn of a hidden beast—and for a towering shaggy white monster (with frost forming into new shapes nearby) to answer Justas’s challenge.
