  "shortSummary": "Drawn by omens around the Great Chasm, five adventurers and a terrified Zimkovan woman are torn from the world by an impossible ice storm and awaken on a lone platform in Zeyfa’s Labyrinth, where ice wolves, wind-shaped shades, and chasm wisps test their resolve before they choose to leap into a maze that may be the only way out.",
  "longSummary": "As storms and strange signs around the Great Chasm escalate, Jrain Fanlish, Finnan Oakstride, Justas Rhostrin, Ekko, and Eolo converge on its rim from Breva, Dravnieki, and Kemeko, joined by Kalima, a Zimkovan woman who recently staggered out of the chasm speaking only Old Zimkovan. A sudden, unnatural blizzard of ice and snow rips them from the world and hurls them into darkness, leaving them stranded on a circular ice platform beneath a false storm-sky, flanked by two wolf 'statues' guarding narrow bridges. When Eolo approaches one, both wolves animate, shattering their shells and unleashing a brutal fight across slick ice as the creatures try to drag their prey over the edge, followed by the arrival of shrieking wind-shades and chasm wisps that lash minds and vision. In the aftermath, Finnan’s magic and language soothe Kalima enough for her to reveal that they stand in Zeyfa’s Labyrinth, a maze ruled by the cruel West Wind and fed by generations of sacrificial victims from her hidden people, who believe the only way out lies deeper in. Testing the hostile environment, the party confirms a lethal updraft bars descent from the platform while the bridges lead to a snow-choked chamber and four twisting tunnels; with Kalima clinging between Finnan and Justas and warning that the labyrinth’s beast 'doesn’t like waiting' and that this is no place to sleep, they leap together into the tunnels, seeking escape by going further in.",
