The party finishes the brutal fight in the black‑stone chamber, kills the shaggy white beast, follows a new earthen tunnel out to the cliffside village of [[Melusa]], and learns that an Ice Palace and its soldiers are watching.

## Timeline

- **(DR:: 1730-01-25), late afternoon:** The party defeats the white beast of snow and ice and emerges into [[Melusa]], a village perched in endless fog on the edge of the [[Great Chasm]].
- **(DR:: 1730-01-25), evening:** The party takes refuge with Kalima’s family, learns what it can of Melusa’s rules and fears, and discovers the Ice Palace is stirring.

## Cast of Characters

- **[[Jrain Fanlish]]** – scout and archer, steady under pressure and quick to vanish into cover.
- **[[Finnan Oakstride]]** – bard and storyteller, turning magic and memory into information and leverage.
- **[[Justas Rhostrin]]** – veteran of the north, devoted to the [[Kestavo]] and unafraid to call monsters out.
- **[[Ekko]]** – kenku druid, scouting as beast and calling up primal allies when steel fails.
- **[[Eolo]]** – young kenku warrior, whose psionic strikes land even when mundane shots fail.
- **[[Kalima]]** – Melusan woman and reluctant guide, hiding behind illusion during the fight and then leading the party to shelter.
- **Rala** – Jrain’s avian companion, harrying the “living snow” in the fight. 
- **Nura** – Kalima’s sister in [[Melusa]], sheltering the party. 
- **Khaled** - Nura's husband 
- **Samir** – Nura and Khaled’s infant kin, unnervingly quiet.
- **[[Forquarion]] the Frostbinder** – named as the master of the Ice Palace (in Finnan’s earlier magic and this session’s scouting).
- **[[Zeyfa]]** – named as tied to the labyrinth and its sacrifices; feared in Zimkovan lore. 

## Places

- **[[Great Chasm]]** – visible again from a cliffside switchback beyond the tunnel.
- **[[Melusa]]** – cliff‑carved village in fog, surviving by endurance and sacrifice.
- **Ice Palace** – a floating stronghold near Melusa, beating time with a gong and sending eyes and soldiers into the fog.

## Narrative Summary

Our session begins with the party pinned in the black-stone chamber, fighting through the beast’s “Living Snow” echoes—shadows of ice and hunger that slow, harry, and confuse. As ordinary arrows and claws prove unreliable, they improvise: Ekko’s conjured pack tears through the melee, Justas’s Spirit Guardians defends him and keeps the enemies at bay, and Eolo’s psionic strikes punch through defenses when mundane damage fails. With Kalima hiding behind an illusory wall, and the beast’s chilling gaze repeatedly stared down, the group identifies that the echoes are tuned to each one of them, and actively defending their master. As they switch attacks - each one using their attacks against a beast that was summoned to fight another - they defeat the echoes and, finally bring the shaggy white monster crashing to the ground. 

When the beast dies, the howling wind stops and the chamber itself changes: frost weeps away, granite shows through, and an earthy tunnel splits open in the floor. The party follows Kalima through the permafrost passage and emerges onto a cliffside switchback overlooking the Great Chasm, where an isolated Ice Palace floats near two bridged rocks—one lush with strange growth, one grazed by cattle. Guided to the cliff-carved village of Melusa, they take shelter with Kalima’s family and learn unsettling truths about a life defined by fog, endurance, and sacrifice.  Finnan sends a conjured fey to speak with the master of the Ice Palace - known to be [[Forquarion]] the Frostbinder, from Finnan's earlier magic.  After the fey does not return, he uses _Clairvoyance_ to discover a complex circular stone with writing in [[Sylvan Writing|sylvan]] at the very top of the highest spire, and later to discover an ice bridge beginning to grow toward the village as soldiers search for a “trickster” spirit.

Ekko meanwhile, scouts as a cat, and discovers five magical gashes in the cliff face, guarded by a squad of human guards and a 40 foot tall ice status of a wolf. Each of the gashes looks into a different, hostile elsewhere (a lightning storm, metallic spikes shimmering, impossible flashing colors, swirling ash and ice, and a mirror-like chasm view without the village).

As the scouting winds down, the party decides to rest, after a augury of Justas' to the kestavo reports a positive outcome.
