- Tollen one shot (D&D version and FATE version); considered canon, timeline a bit ambiguous
- Stone Titan one-shot (considered canon, set "a while ago" but can modify exactly when)
- Informatics one-shot (maybe not canon? but has some decent villages and such, so at least import those)
- Oskar and Riswynn adventures (various one shots set in Yuvanti Mountains)
- An abortive three-session game with the same plotline that become the [[Cleenseau Campaign]]. Definitively not canonical (as the same events were run again with a different set of PCs) but some small amount of interesting character development
