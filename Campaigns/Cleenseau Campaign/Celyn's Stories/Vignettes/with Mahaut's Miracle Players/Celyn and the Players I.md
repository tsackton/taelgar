Travelling with the Players was very good for what Celyn considered his most important work: taking care of the Wyrdling’s people.  Which was, on the one hand, looking out for Josse, as a playwright, and also possibly a bit mad, but on the other, they went through any number of small villages that might have people like him, who he could find and help.  Sometimes he got a little nudging sense to go somewhere and find someone, and more often than not it meant finding someone to help, in particular.  

It was quiet, satisfying work, but the sort of quiet and satisfying that he thought would not last forever.  Still, it was good to come back through a village and see one of the people he thought of as his people turn up at the show, doing well - maybe with more curves, or a deeper voice, or having found the interesting combination of being that served them best.  He was always glad of it, and them.  

He did his best to remember them, check in with them, enquire after them if they had left their towns.  It didn’t matter that they didn’t need him anymore; he liked knowing that they were all right.  That their small personal miracles had progressed as they ought.  
  
His protectiveness of his people was not the sole reason he got involved in the bar fight that one time, though it was probably why he weighed in on the ‘fight’ side rather than the ‘try to intervene peaceably’ side.  It didn’t help that Delia - the woman he weighed in on protecting - had spotted the other party cheating at cards, which meant that Celyn could also, if he were so inclined, take the whole thing as a slight to the Wyrdling, given that cheating at games of chance was entirely opposed to questions of luck and, for that matter, chaos.  

Delia was not much of a fighter.  Celyn, on the other hand, was certainly enough of a fighter to deal with the cheater and both his friends, especially after one of them broke a bottle on his shoulder and thus gave him a wicked shard of pottery to use to defend himself.  The fact that he held it so tightly he cut his own hand was of no account to him in the moment, though it concerned him a good bit more later, when Mahaut was bandaging it up and frowning.  

“You’re not one for brawls, usually.”  

He said, with a shrug that made the bruised shoulder ache, “Got a temper on me. And I don’t like cheaters.”  

Mahaut grunted.  “Yesterday if you’d said you had a temper I wouldn’t have believed you.  Did you even notice they were bigger’n you?”  

“Most people are,” Celyn pointed out.  “I’m short.”  

That made her snort.  “Hope this don’t happen often. Makes trouble with the town guard, if we get a reputation for fights.  And don’t go out on your own.”  

“Next I go out I’ll see if Alys wants to join me?”  

“Fine.”  
  
The hand hadn’t quite fully healed when they made it to the next village.  He had refused to let the Wyrdling’s power mend it, because he was certain, somewhere, that there was something that he needed to learn from it, and he wanted to meditate on it while he was trying to solve that.  

He was not expecting to find another person in need of his particular care, there; they had been through too recently.  So he was surprised when he felt the nudge of intuition and dream sending him out late one night.  Too late to wake Alys for, certainly, but he could go quietly and ghost along the street in the dimness until he found what he was supposed to find.  

A child, crying.  

“Hey.”  

The child squeaked and backed up a bit and then demanded “Are you one of the monsters?”  

Celyn got along with children.  Partly because he always took them seriously.  “No.  But I can make a light to scare away monsters.  Would you like that?”  

The boy nodded.  Celyn fumbled on the ground for a pebble and made a mental note to keep some on him in the future.  He drew in a breath and breathed on it and there was light, golden and shimmering with rainbow edges, and he held it out to the boy.  “There.”  

The child took it in both hands, face filled with wonder.  “Oh.  It’s better now.”  

“It won’t last forever, but it should last long enough to get you home.  Can you help me find home?”  

By the time he got the child safely back to his terrified parents he was clear that the boy was suffering from hallucinations, and he told them he would talk to the apothecary in the morning, for something that might help calm his mind.  He did not know those recipes; madness was not his specialty of the Wyrdling’s concerns.  
  
The hand healed, leaving a little scar that held a memory of the jagged edge of the pottery shard as it cut into skin, as he’d held it like a dagger with an unwrapped hilt.  Celyn occasionally ran his other thumb over it, and thought about madness, and what Eirian had said.  

He had a difficult adolescence, was what he told people.  Partly because he didn’t want to get into trying to explain the sense of wrongness that had been his body trying to grow into a woman’s at the time, partly because even aside from that he didn’t know how to explain it, really.  

What he knew now was that being out of season with himself, without knowing what it was, had driven him mad.  Not in the sense of seeing phantasms or hearing things that weren’t there, but in the sense that everything was sharp-edged as broken pottery, and it bled.  And he could either take the violence of those edges inwards, or he could take it outwards, and he had mostly followed a knife-edge line of both and neither, as best he could, at the time, that made him sharp and fierce and wrapped him around the violence like leather cord around the hilt of a knife.  

It was something he could make choices about now.  The Wyrdling made sure that he could make choices about having a knife made of madness at the heart of him; the knowledge of it being there kept him safe, kept other people safe.  He could take it out when he needed it; he could put it away.  He needed to remember it was there, and that it might come out when he didn’t want it, if he was pushed out of season again.  Like when he had been thought of as a girl.  Like when they tried to give the Mother credit for him.  

Ellis had been so smart, to see that those felt like the same thing to him.
