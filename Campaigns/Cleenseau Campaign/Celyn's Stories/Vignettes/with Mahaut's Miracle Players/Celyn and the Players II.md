Sometimes Celyn climbed up to sit on top of one of the Players’ wagons.  It took time and effort and the use of a bit of scaffolding, generally speaking, but once he was there he could sprawl out and just be and watch the birds or listen to whatever was going on where they were encamped.  Mahaut knew where he was, of course, but Mahaut had her finger on the pulse of everything.  

The wagon thumped oddly and he rolled up onto his side to peer and see Charlotte climbing up on top too.  She was stronger than he was by a little but he thought she maybe didn’t handle the scaffolding as gracefully; it all worked out in the end.  

“What’re you doing up here?”  

He shrugged.  “Being.  Thinking about home.”  

“Yeah?”  She swung her legs around and leaned in a little.  “You leave a girl back in your village when you left?”  

“Nah.”  Celyn let that sit a moment.  “A boy, though.”  Never mind that he and Ellis had sorted out that they couldn’t keep making it work, not with Celyn being all of what he was, now.  It still hurt, a little, but not as much as it used to.  

There was a short pause before she said, “Oh?”  

“Yeah.  Ellis.”  Celyn flopped back again.  “Beautiful. Amazing musician.  Bit of a streak of mischief. Flirted with everyone except me.”  

“Except you?”  

“He could tell I wouldn’t like it, so he was different.  And brought me all the gossip.”  Celyn waved a hand in the air and proceeded to talk her ear off about Ellis for a while, until she said she had things to do and climbed back down.  He felt maybe a little bad about leading her to the conclusion that he didn’t fancy women at all but Antonin did not at all seem to mind her turning her attentions to him, really.
