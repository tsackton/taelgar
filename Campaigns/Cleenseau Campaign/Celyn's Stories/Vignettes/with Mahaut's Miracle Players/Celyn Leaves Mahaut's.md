# Celyn Leaves Mahaunt's Miracle Players

> [!Info]- This is Celyn's story of when he left Mahaunt's Miracle Players. Please don't read unless it has been revealed in game
> 
> Celyn frowned at the shield that Josse had insisted he take out of the props wagon.  He had tried to paint birds on it.  Two birds, in different colors.  They were probably not entirely unlike birds at least.  He had not done a very good job.  Which of course was another thing to shrug and not worry about.  
> 
>Mahaut had given him some leather armour, and he already loved it.  Not just for the protection, given that he had uneasy feelings that there would be fights against more than just desperate people who had turned bandit in his future.  No, he loved the way its rigidity covered his chest and meant that he didn’t need to bind as tightly to look like himself.  He took in a deep breath, because he could, and stepped out to say goodbye to his friends.  
>
>There was Alys and Adri, together, and they had something, and he blinked at them.  
>
>“We all chipped in,” said Adri.  “Better to have something with a little more reach than a knife, if you can use it.  But I’ve seen you doing background on the stage, I think you can use it.”  
>
>Celyn took the sword and tested the balance.  “I can use it.”  
>
>Alys added, “Also the dagger fighting left you looking like a blood-drenched madman.”  
>
>Celyn shrugged and grinned at her.  “I do swear by the Wyrdling for a reason.”  She snorted.  
>
>He said his goodbyes to the Players and walked away.  “I don’t know where to go from here,” he addressed the air, and thought, perhaps, he heard a rustle.  “Do I go home?”  There was a road here, east and south, towards Eskbridge.  The Players would be going that way soon, so it couldn’t be Eskbridge; he was clear that the Players were going the wrong way.  
>
>“West to Gowerbourne?” he speculated, and shrugged, and tried that way.  Then, “Ow.”  The acorn had hit him square on the top of his head.  He paused, and then tried again; a second acorn hit him between the eyes.  Third time made a confirmation, though this time he brought his shield up to block it and said, “I’ll go a different way, then.”  
>
>They had come down from Embry.  Which meant taking the road south and a bit west, towards Fellburn.  
>
>There were no acorns thrown at his head when he went that way.
