Of all the acrobats, Alys was Celyn’s favorite.  She was shorter than he was, and also much broader, with a solidly built muscularity that put her in support roles more than the flashy top tumbles that the lighter performers would do.  Not that she couldn’t do them, and with flair, but the lightr acrobats couldn’t do the anchoring that she handled with equal panache.  She was a glorious performer with a mane of autumn-leaf colored curls that reminded Celyn a little bit of his sister’s red hair, though everything about its texture and style was different.  

Possibly he was just a little homesick.  

Alys loved to gamble as much as Celyn did, though she was a lot more intense about wanting to win rather than just the joy of the game.  But they spent a lot of evenings together, with whoever else they could drag in from the other performers or occasional people in their vicinity, throwing dice, drinking, being amiably rowdy.  

He did work around to wondering if how he felt about Alys had been how Ellis felt about him, though he did not manage to work out what to do with it before an evening where she came back from buying her beer from a local tavern and proceeded to wax rhapsodic about the curves on one of the barmaids there, in a way that made it very clear that no man could meet those sorts of standards.  

Celyn had spent too much time working on not being a woman to reconsider that now, so he relegated the question of how he felt about Alys to unimportant matters that he would not worry about.
