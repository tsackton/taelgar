Celyn had tucked himself into a fold of the hill under a tree to work on his drum.  The drum was an ever-changing thing, depending on which feathers and sticks and other such things seemed to need to go on it, threaded through the lacings or dangling from odd bits of thread or string that he salvaged from Mama’s work.  Today he wanted to get a pattern of leaves around the edge while they were still green, so he was working diligently on tucking them into the lacings without ripping them.  

There was a rustle, and he looked up: the person approaching was tall, darkhaired, carrying a crwth by a grip about the neck with a left hand.  Celyn narrowed his eyes slightly, glancing at the face, and then said, “Llew, tell Ellis to stop messing around. You stop messing around too.”  

Llew laughed and threw up his free hand in incredulity.  “How do you always know?  I lose this bet every time.”  

“If I told you you might get better at looking like him and then what would happen?  You might have to kiss me.  And you don’t like kissing boys.  Better I don’t tell you, and then you don’t have to worry about it.”  Celyn grinned at him.  

Llew laughed again and turned back, whistling sharply.  It was only a few minutes before Ellis joined them, twirling Llew’s favorite pipe in his hands, which produced a certain amount of brotherly bickering before they traded instruments.  Ellis curled his right hand around the neck of his crwth and sat down across from Celyn.  “Beat him again, huh?”  

Celyn shrugged.  “I just pay attention.”  He finished the leaf he was lacing into the drum and flipped it over, so he could brush his fingers across the head.  “C’mon, Llew, join us, let’s play.”
