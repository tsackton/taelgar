Celyn was not sure he’d done a good job explaining all of it, what he and Grandfather Trefor had said after he’d hiked down to Nefyn.  He hadn’t talked about what he and Ellis had discussed before, about knowing he was bound to leave, and he still didn’t talk about that; it was too complicated an injury for words.  He did, at least, manage to talk about how frustrated he was that everyone assumed that he would just settle into the Mother’s temple and do what he was told, and his mother had laughed and laughed at that.  Of course, she knew better.  

“I suppose I always knew,” she said then, “that you weren’t going to be settling down with that Crowther boy and making beautiful grandchildren.”  

Celyn grimaced and said, “Mama!” in protest.  He supposed, distractedly, that it was possible that he and Ellis might have someday worked around to something more physically intimate than the cuddling and kissing they actually did, but he was genuinely not sure how.  His thoughts went and skittered sideways at the thought, because his own body betrayed him, and that was not something that was fixed with his herbs and potions and binding.  It would take some other miracle, some other magic, and he was not counting on that happening again in his life.  

“I’m just teasing, dearest,” she said, softly, because she read something of the distress in his tone, he thought.  But she would have no reason to understand how much the concept of things like grandchildren was a complicated, painful tangle of body and spirit that he was in no way up for facing.  “And Blodwen and Cynog are keeping me in beautiful grandchildren.”  

“I know you’re teasing, mama,” he said, forgiving her immediately.  She meant him no harm.  “It’s okay.”
