“Come on, Llinos!  Don’t be lagging!”  
        Cynog was grumpy, but he was often grumpy, particularly with his youngest sibling - seven years younger and easily distracted, in this case by a flight of geese headed for the river to the west.  It was a gruff fondness, more often than not, rather than real annoyance.  
        Said youngest sibling waited for the geese to pass to the far side of the sky before making certain of the grip on a bundle of flowers and hurrying along behind Cynog.  They were going to Nefyn, and Nefyn was rather exciting compared to Clawyn; more specifically, they were going to see Delyth the Dyer.  
        The one called Llinos was more than a little uncertain of the web of trade and favor-trading that was involved there, but did know a few things.  First, that Delyth the Dyer needed lots of different sorts of plants, in quantity, to deal with the wool from Rassau and the mohair from Clawyn and whoever else had fleece, there were probably others.  Rassau was simply the known factor, up in the hills like Clawyn but not having the right sunlight or something for vines.  Second, that the people who supplied those plants were sometimes paid in coin, and sometimes in favors for later, which is how Cynog had his bright red coat that he was so pleased with.  And, of particular relevance to this hike, that the new leaves off the apple trees were among the things that Delyth the Dyer could make use of, which is why the whole family - and several others - had been up in the branches in the grove thinning leaves to put in the sack that Cynog was carrying.  
        All in all it was a wondrous and magical trip, even if Cynog was grumpy about having an eight-year-old tagging along behind.  
        The dyer’s house was surrounded by strictly organized gardens.  The dye-weed was in bloom, its bright yellow flowers in their clusters spilling scent everywhere; neighboring beds were full of plants whose season had not yet come for blooming.  Right up near the door were four beds that seemed to have the same plant - one thick with green stems and slender leaves, but with a sign stuck to the front of it with an arc of stars over a crown, where the bed marked with flowers and a full moon was thin of plants.  Llinos turned in place to confirm that, yes, the other two beds had signs too, one with the sun over grain, and one with a hammer and autumn leaves.  
        “Mistress Delyth?  It’s Cynog Bettws from Clawyn, we’ve the apple leaves for this season.”  
        Mistress Delyth opened the door.  She was an adult, but not old enough to have grey in her glossy hair, and she wore the blue that came of dye-weed.  “And who’s this, then?” she asked.  
        Cynog nudged Llinos, who bowed, careful not to drop the armful of flowers.  “You may call me Llinos.”  
        “A fine name.  Come in, let me get my book.  What are the shares?”  
        Cynog swung the sack around and put it where she pointed.  When she had the book down he said, “Four share for Bettws, three for the Crowthers, one each for the Lloyds and the Rheons.  And a half share for old lady Medwin.”  
        Delyth looked up.  “A half share?”  
        “Nye Medwin, he passed on at midwinter, and we all agreed on a half-share’s worth for the widow, ma’am.  She could do with some new bright.”  
        The dyer looked like she wanted to say something, but eventually just pursed her lips slightly and said, “Kind of you all to think of her.”  
        “Ma’am.”  
        “Why aren’t you happy about it?” Llinos asked.  
        “Llinos!” Cynog said, sharp and scandalized.  
        Delyth laughed.  “Oh, it’s just that a half-share messes my maths.  But I’ve put you in for eight shares for Bettws, six for the Crowthers, two for the other families, and one for the widow, and that works out just fine.”  
        “Oh,” said Llinos.  “Okay.”  
        “That’s twice as much as we brought, ma’am, that’s hardly fair to you.”  
        She shook her head and rubbed the bridge of her nose.  “Don’t you worry about it.  I’ll do it out by the weight of what you have.”  
        Cynog looked uncertain and anxious about it.  Llinos watched him for a moment and then asked, “Why does the plant in front of your house with the most, um, the most plants have the Night Queen sign?  And the one with hardly any have the Mother sign?”  
        That seemed to defuse the confusing situation.  Delyth chuckled and scooped up the sack and poured out the leaves into a basket for weighing.  “The madder root is harvested just before winter.  The Night Queen marks the one that I’m to harvest then.  Then I replant the new roots, and move the signs one season around, so the new planting is in spring, with the Mother, and it has four years to get nice fat roots before I dig it up again.”  
        “Moving the signs every time you harvest,” Llinos said thoughtfully.  “Okay.”  
        “And what is it you have there, Llinos?”  
        “Queen’s lace.”  
        “Queen’s lace?  You’re certain you have that and not hemlock.”  
        Llinos sighed the sigh of someone who did not understand why all the adults kept asking that question.  “The stems are sort of fuzzy, the flowers are resting in a cup of leaves, and the green isn’t blotched with purple like someone who’s got poison in them.  It’s Queen’s lace.”  After a pause, there was an additional sulky, “The lady said you’d like it.”  
        “The lady?”  
        “The green lady.  But she told me not to take all of it, just half.  But this is half.”  
        “The ... green lady.”  Delyth paused in her scooping up the weighed leaves to look at Cynog.  
        He cleared his throat.  “We suspect some sort of forest nymph, ma’am, but don’t you worry, she’s got the knack of making them like her, she’d not have poison from there.”  
        The dyer considered a moment and then accepted the bundle of flowers.  “An uncanny one, then.  All right.”  
        “She’ll be apprenticing to mind the standing stones and such when she’s a little older, ayup.  Keeps her out of trouble.”  He ruffled Llinos’s hair, causing a profound pout.  
        “And this is all Bettws share?”  
        “Yes,” said Cynog, and Llinos did not appear to object.  “Come on, we’ve got errands.”  
        Llinos laughed, sulk forgotten.  “You just want to go see Ffraid.”  
        Cynog’s complexion was the sort that showed blushes quite well.  
        “He thinks Mama doesn’t know,” the child added to Delyth.  “But she lets him do most of the errands to Nefyn.”  
        The dyer laughed, her tension defused somewhat by a more normal sort of uncanny perceptiveness.  “I don’t think your brother wanted you to notice that.  Possibly not your mother either.”  
        Llinos shrugged, and followed Cynog out as he departed, his ears still bright red.  
  
***  
  
        Depending on how one counted, there were between one and two dozen people in Clawyn of about Llinos’s age.  All of Llinos’s siblings were substantially older - Blodwen had earned herself a plum position as an apprentice vintner, learning the secrets of what happened after everyone else grew the grapes; Cynog worked in the vineyard, like their father; Pryce did his turn in the vineyards, but was what people called a little bit fey and got on better with the goats.  
        Where Pryce was a little bit fey - just a touch peculiar, maybe - Llinos was entirely so, occasionally verging into the feral.  If the child could be gotten to do the work of trimming back the grape leaves, it was only because there were garlands to be woven of them, apparently, to adorn some standing stone in response to some unarticulated need.  Weeding was impossible, unless of course the weeds were the sort of wildflower that was suited to flower crowns; on the other hand, Llinos’s cheerful willingness to occupy younger children with the manufacture of said crowns did at least keep the entire lot of them out of trouble so other work could get done.  The child could be found dancing with her shadow on sunny days or arranging rocks to change the trickling flow of runoff on rainy ones, rather than any more sensible chores.  Once Llinos brought an injured fox kit home, carried in folded-up skirts, and diligently fed it on eggs and offal until it had recovered enough to trot back into the hills.  It was entirely unclear to even the child’s family whether the comment “She didn’t give me a name to call her” implied that the kit had said something else.  
        Not all of Llinos’s antics were so benign.  The petty theft was, for the most part, petty rearrangements, at least when people managed to figure out what had happened; missing objects were often replaced with pretty - or at least interesting - rocks, and once with some sort of seashell whose interior was entirely pearlescent rainbows, the provenance of which was entirely mysterious.  When a prized trowel went missing only to be discovered with the haft buried in a pile of mulch, ringed with white stones, like some strange monument, there was enough general uproar that Llinos had to be seen to be punished.  
        “She asked me to,” was all the child would say in explanation, and that was not deemed enough.  
        But the next day the milk went sour.  All of it.  In the entire village.  
        This, too, provoked uproar, and after some discussion the temple steward and Llinos’s cousin Ilean - about Pryce’s age and learning the ways of boundary-walking and minding the standing stones - went and tried to figure out how they had offended the local fey.  In the end, Llinos was released from confinement and sent into the hills with the trowel, several honeycakes, and an actual bottle of wine, and after that the milk stopped reeking and the goats stopped tossing their heads and shifting uncertainly whenever anyone approached them to try to get more.  
        Ilean came to visit and said, “She’s going to need to start learning the ways soon,” with no preamble.  She was a fierce young woman already, her strength of personality honed by her need to protect her younger brother.  “Or she’ll get into more trouble.  And they like her.”  
        The fey did not object to Ilean, but it was true, they didn’t like her the way they liked Llinos.  
        “She can come out with me when I do the rounds.”  
  
***  
  
        After Llinos was actually learning to walk the boundaries and tend the stones, rather than being driven by impulse, things got a little less chaotic.  At least for a while.  The garland-making tendencies certainly dominated, and if the child was haring off to do shadow-dances or leave oats scattered in fairy rings that was, at least, technically within the scope of reasonable and sensible chores now.  Llinos had finally found a place that made sense, and there was a collective sigh of relief at that.  
        Which was not, of course, to say that there weren’t other incidents.  When Llinos was about eleven, all the children of reasonable age had gone out to clear nettles so they could be set out to dry and be harvested for fiber.  Wool was all right for outer layers, but even up in the hills when the summers got hot there needed to be other sorts of clothes, and those were blends of nettle and hemp, for the most part.  The vintner’s family had linen, and some of that made its way to the temple and a few others, but nobody nearby grew flax and that meant money and expense and trade the likes of which most people in the village could not afford.  Llinos was paired up with Ifan, in the hopes of keeping Ifan out of trouble; he would listen to his cousin’s guidance, at least, more than many, as they had been playmates for years, despite the difference in ages.  
        The chore was half picnic, with a basket of supplies and several of the children, who knew things about foraging, inclined to take breaks from the nettle-cutting, which was both hard work and likely to get them stung, to collect berries and things, either to eat now, or to bring home later.  Llinos was more than slightly inclined that way, though diligent enough to give Ifan clear direction on what he needed to do; his strength and general obliviousness to pain meant that he would be tremendously effective at clearing out the nettles.  
        It was, as things turned out, fortunate that Llinos was more inclined to forage than do the assigned task, though nobody was quite sure of that for some time after the child barreled into Ellis Crowther and punched him soundly in the face.  Ellis sat back on his rump, one hand pressed over his eye, while his twin brother loomed over Llinos.  The twins were not yet come into the height they would get later, but Llinos was still much smaller than they were.  
        “What’d you do that for?” Llew demanded.  
        “He was going to pick that mushroom.”  Llinos pointed.  
        “And?”  
        “That’s a fey mushroom.  They’d get mad.”  
        The boys put their heads together to talk quietly, half in gestures that made sense in the sort of secret language of twins.  Llinos had figured out a few bits of it, but not all of them.  
        “How do you know?” Ellis asked.  
        Llinos sighed.  “Look.”  Here was the cluster, the seven of them together; that was a sign.  Look at the way the moss grows thicker here than there.  Consider the path that leads back here, the way it shimmers slightly with magic.  “Also, it’s poisonous.”  
        “You could have started with that!” Ellis objected, but he was laughing.  
        “Oh,” said Llinos.  “Okay.”  
        The twins shook their heads, and Llew helped Ellis up, and they went back to the nettles, perhaps on the principle that doing that would be less likely to get them punched by an agemate who wasn’t all that strong but certainly meant it.  
        Ellis went back later and left a bit of bread and some berries he had gathered at the spot, though, just in case a gift might ease any offense he had given with his error, and Llinos beamed at him, and was not at all sure why his golden-brown skin darkened.  
  
***  
  
        By the time Llinos was thirteen, the sharp edges had started to grow again, and prowling around being feral and unpredictable occupied a great deal more time.  Some of it wound up, though, helping Pryce with the goats.  Pryce was Llinos’s favorite sibling; he made no demands, and he understood the things that were hard to talk about, like the way the breeze sometimes smelled of magic when it came out of the hills, or the ghostly sounds of pipes at night.  
        Pryce even seemed to understand the pain, well enough; when Llinos was overcome by it, he offered a shoulder to lean on, draped an arm around, and squeezed gently as they sat and watched the goats together.  He had no answers for why it was there, or how to make it better, but he could at least not blame Llinos for suffering it, or make disapproving faces.  He shared his bread, and gestured for Llinos to help with his regular rounds checking the goats for injuries, and made no demands.  
        “I’m going to go collect some berries and things,” Llinos said, and he just nodded and leaned on his stick, staring off down the slopes of the hills to where the grain around Nefyn was growing.  
        The expedition into the copse took longer than Llinos had expected; there was some sort of plant that did not belong there that had to be rooted out, though chasing that impulse down rooted out some of the impulse to destruction and left a rather good mood behind.  Llinos was expecting to rejoin Pryce and have a quiet remainder of the afternoon in good spirits.  
        Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  There were two men in the pasture, tall and looming over Pryce, who was built like Mama, who was built like Llinos, flexible like a willow twig.  
        “Look me in the eye and talk to me, boy,” boomed the one of them.  The accent was not local, and not familiar either, but of course nobody local would do something as ridiculous as demand someone look them in the eye.  Were they lost?  What on earth were they doing in Clawyn’s pastures?  They must have come up from the west, but why?  
        None of which was terribly relevant, really, for all the thoughts flitted through Llinos’s mind: the important thing was that they were upsetting Pryce, who kept backing up, holding his staff in front of him, his knuckles gone white clutching it.  
        “Leave him alone!”  Llinos marched down the slope, trying not to smash the berries with the impulse to make a fist.  “You’re upsetting him!”  
        One of the men turned away from Pryce, at least.  “What’s your name, girl?”  
        Llinos’s eyes widened slightly, not at the demand so much as its reckless rudeness.  “You can call me—”  It took a moment to figure out what to respond, but the next bit came out in flowing Sylvan, half in the hope that these men would realize that demanding names was likely to get them into trouble.  “The little bird who’s going to peck your forsaken eyes out if you don’t leave my brother alone.”  
        The two of them traded looks and one muttered, “Did you get all that?” to get a shrug from the other.  “All right, uh, Lulu—”  
        Llinos proceeded to ignore him.  Llinos had not given permission to be called ‘Lulu’.  Llinos was busy checking in with Pryce, in silent gesture and nods, because Pryce was in that state where talking to him was just going to make it worse.  There was a reason Pryce took care of the goats.  
        They were well in the midst of sorting that out when one of the men grabbed Llinos by the shoulder.  “Stop ignoring me, child.”  
        Pryce’s eyes went wide, and he got very pale as the other one demanded, “Stop being ridiculous, we are here to talk about the goats.”  
        “He doesn’t talk to strangers,” Llinos said, trying to wrench free of the grip and failing.  “Leave him alone, you’re upsetting him.”  The voice had gone to a low growl that made Pryce laugh, a high-pitched anxious noise.  
        After tugging a few more times, Llinos added, “Goat thieves.”  
        For some reason, that made the man let go, affronted.  “We are not thieves,” the one declared.  “We are here for proper trade and purchase of the wool.”  
        Llinos frowned.  “Then why are you bothering my brother instead of talking to people who work with the wool?”  Not that the wool was something they regularly sold; people needed it for clothes.  Certainly, the white fibers were quite fine and all, but that was no excuse to go distress Pryce like that.  
        “Take me to who I should talk to, then.”  
        Llinos looked over at Pryce, who was still gripping his staff like his life depended on it.  A gesture, then, to indicate ‘I’ll take them away and make them someone else’s problem’ and he nodded.  After a grumbled, “Lucky you let go or I’d have bitten you,” in Sylvan, Llinos led them out of the pasture.  
        “What was that?”  
        “Why would you think the goatherd was who to bother, anyway?”  Llinos did not bother to wait for an answer, but stomped off towards the edge of the current pasture, trusting that Pryce would be able to recover without help.  
        They followed into the village proper, which was a good half hour’s hike, and since they kept trying to address ‘Lulu’ Llinos did not bother to acknowledge anything they said.  They did say enough to make clear they had heard - from some route they did not bother to make clear - that the goats found in the Mostreve Hills had particularly fine hair that took dye particularly well, which was all well and good, but did not explain what they were going to do to replace the coats.  It wasn’t like there was a whole lot of extra to go around, and the vines took up a lot of space that was no good to turn the goats loose in.  
        Given that Llinos could not justify either biting them or punching them, the next best thing was to find Mama and proclaim, “Some strangers want to talk about goats and they upset Pryce.”  
        Mama set aside her spinning and stood, picking up her stick for balance; she came out of the house and stared past Llinos at the two following men, a level glare that carried the full weight of her disapproval.  “And how might you be called, then?” she demanded.  
        Llinos grinned fiercely and perched on a wall nearby to watch, so that Pryce might get properly informed of how things happened when he came in that evening after making sure the goats were properly bedded down for the night.  
        At that time, he greeted his sibling with a murmured, “Did you peck their eyes out?”  
        “Mama tore them up one side and down the—” Llinos paused to stare.  “You understood that?”  
        Pryce shrugged.  “I listen.”  
        Llinos laughed and tugged at his hand, dragging him back into the house.  After the meal, their mother gestured them to settle in and said, “Funny that we had such rude strangers asking after goats.  Have I ever told you about the Mostreve goats?”  
        “No, mama.”  
        Pa snorted.  He was set up in the corner with Cynog, discussing some finer point of the vines.  “Not that old wives tale, Olwen.”  
        “Am I not an old wife, Hywel?” she replied with a laugh, shifting her spinning so Llinos could, as was the habit, lean against her thigh.  Pa just laughed and shook his head, so she said, “This is an old tale, now.  Older than Sembara.  Involving a very vain foreigner.”  
        “As vain as Gwawr?”  Gwawr had cascades of rich black curls and deep brown skin and shining eyes and had just learned how to tilt her head just so to get the boys to do things for her, and was quite taken with doing so.  Llinos found it all rather silly.  
        Olwen laughed again. “Gwawr’s not vain, lovely, she’s learning about a new sort of power she’s discovered. She’s not fancying herself in the mirror.”  
        “Except when that mirror’s in a young fellow’s eyes,” Hywel commented from across the room.  
        Llinos made a faintly disgruntled noise, but Olwen’s hand stroking hair calmed it a little.  
        “Are you jealous?” Mama asked gently.  
        Llinos had to think about it.  “That’s not something I want,” was the eventual answer.  “I just.  She’s bending people around her because she can and I don’t know what I think about it.”  
        Olwen continued stroking hair.  “If everyone’s enjoying themselves, then there’s no harm done.  There will be hurt feelings, of course.  And people will learn how to use that power, and how to protect themselves from that power, and what ways they enjoy playing with it.  But it isn’t about vanity; it’s about connecting to people, using that power.  See what she does with it, when she has it - whether she chooses to hurt people, or chooses to enjoy herself, or chooses to help people.”  
        Llinos grunted again, softly.  “Go on, Mama.  With the story about the vain man.”  
        “He came into the hills one summer, the story goes, and he wanted everyone to look at him.  Not to see about liking, like Gwawr, but because he had long hair like silk, paler even than yours, and it shimmered in the light.  ‘Look at me,’ he said, ‘and how remarkable I am.’  And he got rather cranky when people didn’t want to stare at his long shining hair and his fine clothes.  He wanted people to look him in the eye and tell him how fine he was.”  
        “The men today wanted Pryce to look them in the eyes,” Llinos murmured.  
        “And we know better than that, here.  We have no desire to challenge the fey by staring, and the people told the man that he should stop making such demands.”  
        “But he didn’t listen.”  It was an easy guess.  
        “He did not.  He went on to insist that he was the most beautiful creature for miles around.”  
        Pryce let out a low whistle and shook his head, then flopped back onto his back on the floor, making an expansive gesture of disgust that brought everyone to chuckles.  
        “Exactly.  And people warned him again, that was not the sort of thing anyone wanted to overhear, because the fey might take notice of being such a braggart.”  
        “And then the fey did notice, didn’t they?”  
        “Oh yes.  The man was being rude and demanding of the people, and out came someone astride an elk, with hair like starlight and clothes like spun spidersilk, shimmering mist-green.  And they rode straight up to the man, and he looked them right in the eyes and demanded that they agree that he was beautiful.”  
        Both Pryce and Llinos sucked in a breath, in unison, then looked at each other and laughed.  
        “And what did that fey do but allow as how that man was very pleased with his long hair, but he wasn’t using it to do anyone any good.  And he huffed and puffed and said that his beauty was good enough to serve the world, and the fey, well.  The fey did not agree.”  When neither of her listening children jumped in with a ‘so what happened’, she laughed and said, “So they turned him into a goat.  Stubborn, wilful, prideful, yes, but with long shimmering hair.  And that is why the Mostreve goats are like they are, they say.  They have the same lovely hair as that prideful, stubborn man, but now, it serves for more than the adornment of one person’s vanity.”  
        Hywel asked, “So what did those strangers want?”  
        “They wanted to buy all the mohair, as if we don’t have need of it for our own clothes. Were they going to get us wool from Caeglas or further to replace it? That didn’t occur to them.  Come winter we’d want it, now, wouldn’t we?”  
        “Where did they go?”  
        “Down to Nefyn, they’re too proud to take the Wanderer’s Cot.  Maybe they’ll find someone to trade with there.”  Olwen shrugged and scooped up her spindle.  “City people have no sense that sometimes we have things because we’ve need of them.  They think everything is for sale.”  
  
***  
  
        Being angry at the whole entire universe and most of all oneself did not make for good friendships.  Llinos was even more angry than usual, now, because of the fit of rage that seemed to make Ampelos leave.  The petty dramas of the other teenagers were at least something to observe, and so that was what Llinos did; it was confounding enough to be a distraction from the dull ache of existing.  
        Sometimes people went to Olwen to ask what was wrong, and she just said, softly, “Llinos has a wound in her soul that we don’t know how to treat.  Be gentle with her,” which helped, a little, except that something about it also burned.  The Mother had no healing balm for it, not in any prayer, so Llinos sat on the temple steps and watched Gwawr hold court.  Today Llew was courting her with music played on his pipe, a process that Idris kept trying to interrupt, because Idris was rude that way and thought that he should have her attention.  Rather like a goat, perhaps.  
        “Silly, isn’t it?”  
        Llinos peered over at the speaker.  It was Ellis; he had one hand on his hip and was watching his twin flirt.  
        “Anyone with eyes knows she’s for Tegan, but does that stop Idris?”  
        “What about Llew?”  
        Ellis laughed and sat down on the steps.  “Llew isn’t looking to court, quite.  He’s just being friendly.  If she took him up on it, he’d be happy.  If she doesn’t, well, they’ve had a good time, he’s kept Idris off her back a little, and someone else will be happy to fool around sooner or later.”  
        “He knows he’s pretty,” Llinos said judiciously, which made Ellis laugh; it took a moment before the teenager quite realized that an identical twin might well take that as a compliment.  
        Ellis just agreed, though, with a, “He does.  But also we were brought up to make the mood better.”  Their father knew every worksong that had ever been sung in Clawyn and plenty of dance tunes besides, and both of the twins were working hard to swallow that knowledge whole.  They played as a duo, often enough, and went down to the inn in Nefyn sometimes to earn a little extra money.  “There’s plenty of people like that around.”  
        Llinos grunted softly and sighed.  
        “And some who don’t.  I can go if you’d rather?”  
        Llinos scowled.  “It’s not you.  It’s, I’m.”  
        “Your mama says you’re hurting and nobody knows how to mend it.”  
        A rolling shrug.  “I guess.”  
        “May I distract you?”  
        That got a snort.  “You can try.”  
        Knowing the Crowther twins, Llinos was expecting some sort of flirtation that would be, at least, up close enough to study.  However, Ellis instead rummaged about his person and produced a selection of small, brightly dyed woolen sacks, which he started to juggle.  “I’ve been practicing!” he said brightly.  “Sometimes music isn’t the thing.”  
        Llinos laughed.  “Okay, you’ve surprised me.”  
        He beamed.  “Good.  Here, catch.”  He tossed one of the bags over.  “Throw it back, nice and easy.”  
        Llinos arced it up and over, and he snatched it out of the air and kept going.  It had a reasonable heft to it; possibly it had some pebbles sewn in to make it the right sort of weight.  
        “I can only do four right now, I’m working on getting five but when I try they all go everywhere and Llew laughs at me.”  
        “Isn’t that what brothers are for?”  
        “Yeah, but it’s such a bother!”  He laughed again, spun in place, and caught all the bags in one hand with a flashy bow.  
        So things went.  Llinos did not think Ellis understood, at any level, the furious, self-destructive violence that he was being a distraction from; he certainly did not seem to have any particular impulse towards it.  He neither challenged it nor pretended it did not exist, but simply carried on as if it was true but not currently important.  He practiced his juggling, and taught Llinos how; other times he brought out his crwth and tried improvising tunes against Llinos’s drumming.  All in all, he did not stop the ache, but he created spaces and times when it didn’t matter so much, at least for a little while.  
        And, of course, he shared the gossip.  There were times they sat on a wall somewhere quiet, and Ellis had all the commentary about the petty dramas of their agemates that Llinos was observing and trying to make sense of.  He was as forthright about his own flirtations as he was anyone else’s, and there were times he explained things about what he was going to do and invited Llinos to watch, “Because you’re interested in people,” he would say, before loping off to present the wildflowers he had gathered while talking to someone or whatever else he had planned.  
        They had had one of those conversations near the current pasture for the goats, which meant after Ellis left, Llinos hopped over the stone wall and went and sat down on a rock there, while Pryce worked his way through his regular checks of the health of the goats.  When he finished, he came and sat nearby, head tipped a little to one side.  
        Llinos raised eyebrows.  
        “He likes you a lot huh.”  
        “What?”  
        “Ellis. Likes you.”  
        No amount of staring at him changed his placid expression.  “He’s not courting.  Not me.  He’s courting Delwyn right now.  Last week it was Nesta.  He’s not bringing me flowers or playing the crwth for me or telling me how pretty I am or whatever.”  
        “You like those things?”  
        “No!  They’re silly.  But that’s courting.”  
        “For play.  You don’t want the game.  He listens.  Plays with others, who enjoy it.”  Pryce pried himself up with his staff.  “Help with the goats? I’ll get the dog.”  
        One thing Pryce was always good at was dropping the subject so Llinos could figure out how to feel about what he’d said.  
  
***  
  
        About three days later, Ellis was tuning his crwth, sprawled under a tree, while Llinos gatherd flowers to weave a garland for the standing stones.  After a little bit, he set the instrument aside, though, to watch with a little frown.  “Are you all right?” he asked.  
        “Me?  Fine.”  
        Llis snorted and picked up his bow, testing it against the strings.  “You’ve had more convincing nothings,” he said.  “You want to talk about it?”  
        If he had noticed, there was probably no escaping the conversation.  Llinos dropped down on a patch of grass with a grunt.  “Pryce said something odd the other day.”  
        Ellis plucked a string, adjusted the tuning.  “Pryce doesn’t waste time with words unless he really means it,” he noted.  
        “Yeah.  I guess.”  Llinos flopped back and stared at the sky.  “He said you were flirting with me.”  
        “Did he now.”  He sounded amused, but it would be giving too much away to actually look at his expression, which meant the flop had probably been a bad tactical decision.  “And what do you think of that?”  
        “I told him you weren’t doing any of the things you do when you go courting with me.  He asked me if I liked those things, and of course I don’t, but....”  
        He set the crwth aside, and propped the bow against it.  “Pryce doesn’t say much but he’s not wrong often.”  
        That, at least, was worth rolling over for to peer.  “What?”  
        “I mean he’s right.  I think you’re amazing.  Thought it ever since you socked me in the eye that one time.  All I could think was you might not be as strong as my brother but you hit way more like you mean it.”  He laughed and leaned his head back against the tree.  “Llew and me, people say we’re not disciplined, but we’ve got a different art than the vines.  It has different rhythms, needs different things to play a worksong rather than do the work.  And Glynis is better at the worksongs than either of us.”  
        “She’s older.  More practice.”  
        He waved it off with a flip of his hand.  “People call you undisciplined, but they haven’t watched you weave the garlands, or seen how you work on the drums, or any of the other things you do.  And I’m sure when you go up into the hills you’re just as focused on that as you are on the things I can see.  You have a different rhythm too.  I like that. A lot.”  
        Llinos sat up and wrapped arms around knees, feeling the furious wrongness boiling up again.  “But what do you want?”  
        Ellis glanced that way, and then looked up into the branches of the tree again.  “I can’t say I don’t want to kiss you,” he said.  “But you’ve never shown any interest in kissing anyone.  So I’m happy spending time like this with you, and just enjoying it.”  
        There was something soft and vulnerable about him, and Llinos could not let that go unanswered, somehow.  “I really like spending time with you too.  I—”  Trying to explain the pain was impossible, but Llinos tried anyway.  “I don’t know how to say what things are like for me.  I’m just, I feel so wrong, all the time, and it makes me feel awful.  Being around you, it’s— it doesn’t go away, but it doesn’t matter as much either, for a little while.”  
        “I’m glad,” he said, with the sort of earnestness that only comes from a sixteen-year-old in love.  “I’m glad I can do that.  And it’s not like I didn’t know you have a temper, right?”  He touched his cheekbone lightly with two fingers and grinned.  
        Llinos smiled a little and then said, quietly, “Could I sit with you while I weave the garland?  Would it get in the way of your practicing?”  
        “I think we can work something out.”  He had never looked quite that happy, not that Llinos could remember.  
        So Llinos gathered up the flowers again, and settled down at the tree with Ellis, leaning back against his shoulder while he played.  
  
***  
  
        When Celyn came back out of the hills, the first thing he did was go home to find his mother.  He ghosted through the village, flitting from shadow to shadow, because he needed to find her first.  
        She was spinning, as usual, in the house, though she looked up when he opened the door, and said, “Llinos?”  
        “Not anymore,” he said.  “The birds took that name away.”  
        “What may I call you then?” she asked, not missing a beat.  
        “Celyn.  I’m Celyn.”  The fey had said something about holly, when she’d brought him to the tree, he remembered that, hazily.  But the meaning of the name had only occurred to him after he’d found it.  Chosen it.  Whatever.  
        “The Crowther boys and your cousins were looking for you,” she said.  “Are you all right?”  
        “I—”  He stopped.  “There was a miracle, mama.”  
        “You should tell someone about it,” she said.  “Do you want that to be me?”  
        “I’ll tell, mama, but—”  He had to gather his thoughts.  “Could you cut my hair?  I did such a bad job.”  
        She set the spinning aside.  “It is a little uneven,” she agreed with a smile.  “Come, sit, and tell me your miracle.”  
        He told her, in fits and starts, unevenly.  Leaving Idris behind.  Idris liked his hair.  He cut it off.  The fey.  The tree.  The two birds.  The feeling of being nameless, of finding the right name, the new name.  Coming home.  By the time he was finished Olwen had trimmed his hair neatly.  
        “Go see if you like that.”  
        He got up and went looking for the polished metal mirror, peering at it.  “Good.  Yes.”  
        “Would you go tell your cousins you’re home safe?”  
        “I can do that.”  Celyn sucked in a breath.  “Did Ellis go home too?”  
        “I believe he has, yes.”  She spoke very gently.  “Go on, then.”  
        Celyn nodded and slipped out again, moving quietly.  Talking to Aunt Dilys was easy enough, but then he was left with trying to figure out how he could possibly talk to Ellis.  The whole question of Ellis, really, was a tremendous tangle, and he drifted out of the village to the pasture spaces first, to find Pryce.  
        Pryce looked up immediately, though of course once Celyn was getting close he was not trying to keep quiet.  He looked Celyn up and down and raised an eyebrow.  “Better?”  
        “Yeah.”  Celyn hopped over the wall and came over to sit on a rock.  “I.  There was a miracle.”  
        Pryce’s eyebrows went up again.  
        “The Wyrdling.  Sent birds to speak to me.  To tell me what I am.”  He gestured at himself, staring off down the slope.  The pastureland did not get as much reliable sunlight as the places they planted the vines, but it was sunny now.  “That I hurt because I needed to grow into a man.”  
        Pryce nodded slightly.  “Now?”  
        “There’s a Wyrdling temple in Ruthin.  I need to go there.  Sometime.  Soon?”  
        He nodded.  
        They sat in companionable silence for perhaps fifteen minutes before there was the scrape of bow against strings, and then the sound of the crwth, the rippling chording of the strings playing a traditional tune.  Celyn was on his feet immediately, turning in place, and Pryce lifted a hand to point at the nearby copse.  
        The music continued, and Celyn climbed back over the wall and approached slowly.  It was Ellis, of course, who else could it possibly be, but he was tucked in under the trees, facing away from the pasture.  It took a little bit to anxiously circle around to in front of him, to wait for him to look up from his playing.  
        What Ellis said was, “Not Llinos,” immediately.  
        It was enough to make him laugh, an awkward chuckle.  “Yeah.”  
        “Tell me something Llinos would know, if you would,” he said, then, his head leaning back against the tree, deliberately not looking anywhere that could be taken as looking Celyn in the eye.  
        “When you first started courting me you could only juggle four.  I was furious at the world and watching Llew flirt, trying to figure out how he could be... could be him.  You asked if you could distract me.  I thought you were going to flirt with me and I’d have to get mad at you but being mad at you would be a change from just being mad, so I said you could.  And you started teaching me how to juggle instead.”  
        Ellis’s shoulders relaxed immediately.  “What would you like me to call you now?”  
        “Celyn.”  He half-crouched, then stopped and straightened up again.  “Why are you here?”  
        “I knew.  I knew when you came back, if you came back, you’d go looking for your brother.”  Ellis was still looking away.  “He knew I was here.  Pointed this way to tell me where to wait.  I couldn’t find you in the hills, but if you were on fey roads or, or gone to the other side, we wouldn’t.  But if you came back, you’d come here.”  He looked in the vague vicinity of Celyn’s face.  “I didn’t hear anything you said.  Just that you were talking.”  
        “Okay.”  Trying to talk through the miracle a third time was somehow beyond him, so he blurted out, “The Wyrdling told me I’m a boy.”  
        “And you’re...”  Ellis was now studying him.  “You’re not hurting as much anymore.”  
        “I’m hurting.  But I understand. And I know what I need to learn to hurt less.”  
        He took the correction with a small nod.  “You’re.”  His skin darkened a little with a blush.  “You’re beautiful.  Um.  Now.”  
        Celyn sat down nearby.  “You’ve never said I’m beautiful before,” he pointed out.  
        “You’d have hated it if I did,” Ellis said.  “Because it’d have sounded like me telling you you were a pretty girl.  It wasn’t the right thing to say.”  
        “But it’s the right thing to say now?”  
        “I, yeah, maybe?  You’re—”  Celyn had not often seen Ellis at a loss for words, he was usually smooth with language, even glib.  “You’ve been off-balance ever since we were, what, twelve?  Something like twelve?  And now you look like you could walk the ridge of a roof without slipping once.”  
        “I can totally do that anyway,” Celyn objected, before adding, “... I get what you mean though.  And you think me being on balance now is...”  
        “Beautiful.  Yeah.”  He grinned suddenly.  “And fortunately I have more sense than my brother and like boys too.  If—”  He shifted the crwth to one side, opening space for Celyn to sit next to him, making the offer to curl up against his side like they had done so many times in the last year or so.  
        Celyn let out a breath he hadn’t entirely realized he was holding and scooted around to lean on Ellis.  After thinking it over for a moment he said, “You could kiss me if you wanted.”  
        “Could I?”  Ellis’s eyes were suddenly shining.  “I never thought you would.”  
        “Only kisses now that I’m a boy.  Before it just.  No.”  
        “Then I will.”  
  
***  
  
        In the time that Celyn spent in Ruthin learning how to take care of his fellow trans people, he kept thorough and diligent notes in his book.  It was an odd assemblage, considered by the standards of people who might like an orderly prayerbook; while it had prayers, and notes on miracle stories, it was also full of recipes and lists of herbs and what they were good for, all relevant to making the sorts of potions and medicines that people might want.  The contents were all jumbled together, getting added to as he learned things, or heard new stories, rather than divided out neatly into sections.  When he left there were still a number of pages in it, so he could keep noting things down.  Eirian had encouraged him to try writing poetry, but he had not managed the knack for it, certainly not anything worth recording in the book.  
        Having the book was further soothing to the roiling knot of pain.  The things that he had learned had helped him, yes; he had stopped his courses, deepened his voice, the fat on his body had rearranged somewhat.  He still couldn’t grow a beard, but he was coming around to finding that funny rather than infuriating.  All those notes were in the book, but also the sense that he could use what he knew to help the people who needed that blessing, who needed the Wyrdling’s love and acceptance of the difficult and twisting road it was to become themselves.  
        Despite knowing that there were not likely to be many people like him in Clawyn, just for the sheer numbers, he turned his feet back towards home.  As he walked he meditated on the duality of it, the way he had shaped himself to serve and protect people who were not in his home village, not from the people he was from.  The necessity of choice, the tension of it, left him feeling twitchy and uncertain, but there was nowhere else that he particularly wanted to go, so home is where he went.  The Wyrdling has two faces, he thought to himself, the laughing and the crying one.  He contemplated the likelihood that he, too, would live in two states for the rest of his life, tha he had done so before, in fact; it was an odd peace, to accept that ambivalence.  
        He suspected that most people would not be comfortable there.  That that was an edge of madness too far for many.  
        Then he shrugged and kept walking.  
        He was a man who had grown up a girl.  He had been a sweet child with a violent, destructive, thieving streak.  He had been too fey for the humans to handle, too mortal to be fey.  He had been mad, perhaps, and now he was piercingly sane in a way that other people thought was, at best, odd.  What was home and the call of service to his other people but another juxtaposition on the pile, anyway?  
        When he got home, he knew his family would open their arms to him, and would ask him to tell them about his time in Ruthin.  So he rehearsed the stories, the time he spent learning, the things he had learned about costuming that he could talk to his mother about, because Olwen knew about spinning and such and would appreciate that in particular.  He had managed to win a bottle of particularly nice wine from somewhere other than home in a dice game near the temple just before he left, and he thought he would give it to Blodwen, who had won the coveted position of assistant vintner just before he had left.  Maybe it would be useful in her singleminded pursuit of her craft.  
        And indeed, everything was very much as he expected.  Olwen hugged him close, and Cynog grunted his greetings, and Pryce went up to Blodwen’s house to fetch her back so she could accept the bottle of wine and join the celebration that the youngest Bettws had come home.  
        “Are you going to be staying, then, lad?” his father Hywel had asked.  
        Conscious of the tug of his dual nature, Celyn could only answer, “For a while at least.”  He was relieved that nobody seemed surprised by that answer.  
        The next day he went out with Pryce to the pasture and sat, leaning on his brother’s shoulder, just quiet together.  When they brought out the bread and cheese and fruit for lunch, Pryce put his head a little to one side and said, “A while, then?”  
        Celyn sighed.  “I don’t know.  I don’t want to go.  But I don’t think I fit here, either.”  
        Pryce considered, then nodded.  “Gods, different.”  He tossed a bit of cheese to the dog, who accepted it and sprawled nearby, tail thumping.  
        “Yeah.”  He laughed a little and stared off down the slope.  “I didn’t fit before, but I didn’t fit in a way that fits?  The standing stones and knowing which trees we shouldn’t harvest from and I belonged here.  But now I’ve got, I need to take care of my people, which is more than my family.  The Wyrdling’s people.”  
        Pryce nodded again.  “Even Nefyn doesn’t have many.  Apothecary’s good there though.”  
        “Yeah.  It’s... It’s taken care of here.”  Celyn sighed and flopped back on the ground.  “I don’t want to go.  But I need to be the right kind of useful.”  
        His brother leaned back on his hands.  “Rest now.  Solve later.”  
        “Yeah.”  
  
***  
  
        Celyn could not imagine that in the time he had been away Ellis had not moved on.  It had been months, after all, and certainly he would have found someone to be serious about, if not in Clawyn, in Nefyn or one of the surrounding villages.  
        He was not expecting at all that when he slipped into the Golden Sheaf to look for the Crowther twins - they had apparently picked up a regular job entertaining at that inn - that Ellis would spot him near-immediately and gesture vigorously to Llew and then, at a break in their sets, for both of them to come down off the stage to greet him - Ellis to sweep him into a hug, and Llew to complain, “He’s been pining.”  
        Celyn nudged Ellis in the ribs.  “Plenty of pretty girls and sweet boys for you to court,” he said, to cover up his awkwardness about it.  
        Ellis draped an arm around his shoulders.  “But none of them are you!  Did you bring your drum?  No?  I bet we could find a drum, hang on, Llew, would you go see if they have a drum?”  
        “I’m not a performer!” Celyn protested, but Llew was laughing and gone already and Ellis was herding him up towards the stage.  
        “Play with me?”  It was soft and earnest and what could Celyn do but say yes, wedging himself behind the twins with a drum Llew had managed to get from the innkeeper - a bit dusty and with a head badly in need of oiling but it would do for now.  He could pick up the rhythms of what they were playing easily enough and support them in the moment.  
        When they finished up and wound up at the bar for drinks, Llew punched Ellis in the shoulder.  “Show me your tips.”  He peered into the hat and said, “Yeah, I thought so.  You’re too happy, they all went for your hat, not mine.”  
        Celyn leaned his head against Ellis’s shoulder.  “Don’t tell me you haven’t played at flirting with half of Nefyn by now, I won’t believe you.”  
        “Oh, sure,” Ellis said with a laugh.  “That doesn’t mean I’m not glad you’re back.”  
        Celyn was now sure that at some point he was going to break Ellis’s heart, and resolved quietly to put off that day for as long as possible.  
  
***  
  
        In the time Celyn had been gone, Ifan had gotten cranky.  Usually he was like a giant kid, happy to play and do things if a little prone to tantrums.  Now, though, he was more tantrum than play, and unlike Celyn - who had a lot of sympathy for that, really - he was strong enough to make for rather large trouble when he was inclined to be, and it was difficult to get him to stop.  It meant that Ilean turned up very promptly to tell Celyn that the stones needed tending because she needed to keep an eye on Ifan.  
        He was, of course, happy to do so, and happy to have a chance to have a conversaton with Ampelos, who appeared on a branch above him while he was pouring out the wine on the stone and cheerfully demanded a swig from the flask.  It was late afternoon when he came back down out of the hills, to find Ifan and Ilean shouting at each other in the street.  
        “I can do it!”  
        “I just need to be sure—”  
        “Just let me do it!”  
        It turned out that Ifan had been set to clearing stones out of the vegetable field and carting them over to stack up where a wall needed to be repaired.  He was leaning on the handles of the wheelbarrow, looking increasingly white-knuckled furious about it, and the wood creaked alarmingly.  
        “Hey,” Celyn said.  “Why don’t I talk to Ifan, I’m done with the stones and things.”  
        Ilean looked down her nose at him, a little dubiously, but said, “Fine, you talk sense into him.”  
        Ifan glared at her as she went and then shifted his gaze to Celyn.  “You’re going to tell me not to do my job.”  
        “What did Ilean say?”  
        “She said I couldn’t do it alone.  They’re just rocks.”  
        “It seems like the sort of thing you could just do, yeah.  Why won’t she let you?”  
        “She thinks I can’t be trusted with it.”  
        “It seems like the sort of thing where I used to say I’d keep an eye on you and then go pick berries and you’d finish it up,” Celyn pointed out.  
        Ifan grinned, but said, “No berries yet.”  
        “It’s true.  But I think you’ll be fine.”  
        Ifan grunted, and stopped threatening the wheelbarrow, and went and got his rocks.  Celyn did not disappear— he wanted to be sure Ifan was doing all right— but on the third cart of rocks he decided that it was well enough established and he could safely go about his own business.  
        This had two substantial consequences.  The first was that Ifan took the notion to try to repair the wall himself, which promptly collapsed, though fortunately it was not an active pasture space, just the wall around one of the vineyards.  The second was that almost every time after that that Ifan got into an argument with his sister about whether or not he could complete a task, he demanded that Celyn come supervise him.  
        About half the time, it was fine.  Ifan did the work, and wandered off to his own entertainments afterwards, and everything was normal.  The rest of the time Ifan took a notion to take the next step, and then Celyn - if he was still there - had to figure out if it was fine, or if the result was going to be a larger problem.  And when Celyn decided that Ifan needed to be redirected, most of those also turned into fights.  
        It would be easier if Ifan didn’t mean well, really.  Celyn remembered being angry and not actually reliably meaning well, but Ifan just wanted to help.  The problem was that he thought of things to help where he did not have the skills, or where he was unable to understand that it wouldn’t turn out well if he tried.  One of his ideas about goats got him headbutted in the knee and had Pryce, utterly speechless with frustration, prodding him with his staff until he left the pasture.  He broke two amphorae before anyone could convince him that his new idea for how to move and store them was not good.  Sometimes he did just fine, but he remembered his successes far better than he remembered his failures, and got stubborn about it all.  
        Celyn found himself almost as frustrated by him as Ilean was, if, perhaps, a tiny, fading bit more sympathetic.  
  
***  
  
        The time between coming home and when Ifan got himself trampled by an ox was perhaps the most idyllic time Celyn and Ellis managed to spend together.  When neither of them had other things to do, they spent the time largely in each other’s company.  Ellis carried things for Celyn to be extravagant with the standing stones, though Ampelos never showed up when Ellis was there.  They talked for hours - about Celyn’s time in the temple in Ruthin, about Ellis’s amusements of flirting with others, about Ellis and Llew’s vague impulse to come up with something to do with themselves that was not in the village, something that let them be musicians in the world.  They played together, Celyn drumming and Ellis challenging himself to make tunes to the rhythms; sometimes Llew joined them.  
        One evening they were watching the stars come out, Celyn with his head on Ellis’s chest as they both laid in the grass and stared up at the sky.  
        “Oh, I should show you something.”  Ellis rummaged and produced a small object, which he pressed into Celyn’s hand.  
        It was a stone, a little bit rough, but with a hole through it about a third of the way from the edge.  A hagstone.  “Nice,” Celyn murmured.  
        “I’m a little nervous to look through it.  If I see a fey when they don’t want me to they might get angry with me.”  
        Celyn chuckled.  “It’s a risk,” he agreed.  “But I haven’t found them to be that touchy.”  
        Ellis snorted.  “They like you a lot, though.  So I don’t think the rest of us can count on that.”  
        “True enough.”  Celyn laid back down on Ellis’s chest.  “You wanna see something?  Though it’ll mess with the stars.”  
        “What?  Sure...”  Ellis seemed rather uncertain about what could possibly interfere with the stars, and Celyn was pretty sure he had phrased things wrong, really, but there was nothing to do about that now.  
        He cupped his hands around the stone and let out a long breath, feeling the well of hope and inspiration that sustained him, opening a channel to let it flow.  Just a little, just enough to set the hagstone glowing with the shimmering rainbow light.  He uncupped his hands and handed it back to Ellis.  
        “Oh,” said Ellis, claiming it reverently.  “Oh, that’s....”  Some complex realization crossed his expression, and he looked down at the rock, and then back up at Celyn, and it was as if the melancholy that Celyn felt had touched him, somehow, despite the light.  
        “That’s?” Celyn asked, uncertainly.  
        “Will it stay?”  
        “It’ll fade out in a bit,” Celyn assured him.  
        Ellis nodded, sittng up, inviting Celyn to lean against his shoulder, putting an arm around him when he did.  “You have miracles.”  
        “Just light,” Celyn murmured.  “I haven’t told anyone else.”  
        Ellis smiled at that.  “Oh, so it’s our special secret.”  
        “Well.  As much as a light on the hillside is.  Though you can tuck it into your pocket if you want to hide it.”  
        Ellis nodded and cupped it in his hands, slightly shielding the glow.  “The Wyrdling gave you a lot.”  
        “Yeah.”  Celyn sighed.  “I... It bothers me sometimes.”  
        “Bothers you?”  
        “I need to share the light that they gave me.  Does that make sense?  I learned a lot in the temple.”  
        “And then you came back here.”  Ellis squeezed him gently.  “You feel like you’re wasting your skills?”  
        “Something like that.  I don’t know. I’m restless.  I wasn’t restless before.”  
        Ellis nodded.  “It’s okay,” he said, quietly.  He did not elaborate on what he meant by that, but Celyn didn’t need him to, and asking him to say it out loud would hurt both of them too much, anyway.  
        They curled up around the light until it winked out, and then flopped back into the grass together and watched the stars.  
        “There,” Ellis said, pointing near the horizon.  “Moon’s coming up.  We should probably go back.”  
        “Yeah,” Celyn said, quietly, though he did not move until Ellis nudged him.

        After the miracle, Celyn could not stand to be in Clawyn when people might find him.  Hiding from them was not difficult for him, overall, but the entire process was one of infinite frustration, because everyone wanted to talk to him about miracles and nobody would leave him be to recover or, bluntly, to brood.  Even if he was hiding he had to worry about people stumbling across him, anyway, so it was better to be somewhere else.  
        He wondered a lot about whether it was in some way his fault, since he had been supporting Ifan in pursuing some of his notions.  Though he wouldn’t have let Ifan deal with the ox on his own, because Ifan and animals never went well, and Ifan on things that were bigger than he was also did not have a great history.  Ifan was so used to being larger than problems that he dealt badly when that didn’t help the situation any.  
        Celyn had ensconced himself up in the hills, not near anywhere he might run into Ampelos or any other fey, and was working on getting the brooding properly sorted out.  Eventually he wound up sufficiently frustrated that he picked up a stick and started working through shadow-fighting, never mind that Ampelos was not there to make it move for him; he could duel the imaginary figures in his mind just as well.  
        He heard a rustling sound, and turned, and saw Ellis, who had not been trying to be quiet, but who was clearly slightly startled to have Celyn turn on him and threaten him with a stick.  
        “Didn’t mean to startle you,” he said.  
        Celyn said “Ugh” and flopped down on the ground abruptly.  “You found me, huh.”  
        “I asked Pryce which way to go.”  
        That, at least, was good for a laugh.  “You’re smarter than everyone else then.”  
        Ellis shrugged and sat down nearby, leaving Celyn enough space that he could decide if he wanted to lean.  “I’ve always tried to pay more attention to actual you than, you know, what everyone thinks you’re like.”  
        “You actually like actual me.”  The bitterness was rather obvious to both of them, if a bit surprising in its intensity.  
        Ellis considered, leaning his head back against a tree.  “You’re angry at the world again.  Like you were before.”  
        That had not occurred to Celyn, so he frowned and considered it.  “Sort of?”  
        “So I’m not wrong but I’m maybe not right?”  
        Celyn snorted.  “Yeah.  Just.”  He stared at his feet.  “Before I was angry at everything.  And yeah, my temper was there, bubbling up at everything, and I was having tantrums about it, and all those kinds of things, but it wasn’t focused.  It was just what was there.”  
        “And now you’re mad at specific things.  People.”  
        “Yeah.  And I get to the point that I’m thinking about actually hurting people and then I come up here and I wait until it passes.”  
        Ellis nodded, and then said, softly, “You know I don’t understand the, the fighting thing.  But I’ve always known it’s in you.  And I saw you practicing just now?  You fight like you mean it.  I mean, actually dangerous.”  
        “Does that bother you?”  Celyn looked at him sidelong.  
        Ellis had to think about it.  “I don’t know,” he finally said.  “I want to say that of course it doesn’t, but,” he shrugged.  “I don’t want to lie to you and I don’t know if that’s the truth.”  
        Celyn snorted.  “That’s how I feel about it a lot of the time.  I don’t actually want to hurt people.  I’m not Idris.”  
        “I’m not sure Idris wants to hurt people he just wants people to think he’s awesome.”  
        Celyn scooped up a rock and hurled it at a tree.  “Then he should stop being terrible.”  
        “Unfortunately, punishing people for not thinking he’s awesome doesn’t go well for the ‘stop being terrible’ approach,” Ellis said with deliberate, overexaggerated blandness that was rewarded with the desired wry chuckle.  “Anyway,” he went on, “I have a guess about why it makes you so mad.”  
        “Yeah?”  
        “I mean, when you were furious all the time before it was because everyone thought you were a girl, right?  And even though you hadn’t realized you weren’t there was all the, just, people thought you were a girl because of how you were born and acted like that was real even though it wasn’t.”  
        “Right, yeah.”  
        “And you’re not a girl.  And you know you’re not a girl because the Wyrdling gave you a miracle.  And then you went and spent nearly a year at the Wyrdling temple in Ruthin.  It was the Wyrdling that healed you, and....”  Ellis had to look away.  “It changed you.  Not in a bad way!  I’m just, you’re really intense now.  And you’re intense about Wyrdling things.”  
        “Okay?”  
        “But Clawyn’s temple is to the Mother.  And you healed Ifan.  And everyone is oh, praise the Mother, praise the Mother, only that’s not you, that’s some, some unspecific scion of Clawyn would be that.  You’re not unspecific.  You’re exactly who you are.”  This time he looked over and grinned.  “But it’s exactly like them assuming you’re a girl because of how you were born.  They’re assuming you brought out the Mother’s miracle because of where you were born.”  
        Celyn could not deny the truth of it, though he protested a soft, “It was a healing miracle.”  
        “And the Wyrdling healed you.  And what did you tell me, that you were about the light of hope?  Give Ifan hope to do better.  And him dying wouldn’t have been very hopeful, would it.”  
        Celyn snorted.  “No.”  
        “But they’re not going to stop trying to make you fit, and you were never made to fit, and that’s even more now.”  Ellis held out a hand, a little tentatively, and Celyn took it.  “They’re going to keep making you crazy.”  
        “Crazy is also the Wyrdling’s,” Celyn pointed out, with a certain dark humor.  
        Ellis squeezed the hand.  “But so is change, and it’s not going to change.  I, look.”  He looked away.  “I’ve known you weren’t going to stay ever since the night when you showed me the light.”  
        “How do you know that?”  
        He shrugged helplessly.  “I don’t know.  Maybe the Wyrdling’s light gave me an insight into fate?  I just, you’re someone with a destiny.  I’m pretty sure I’m not.”  
        Celyn had no idea what to say to that so he just wrapped his hands around Ellis’s.  
        “I don’t understand miracles, and I don’t understand what makes you fight like you do, and that’s kind of a lot to not understand.  I accept it.  But I don’t understand it.  And that means that at some point I’ll hurt you, not understanding.”  
        “I don’t think you would.”  
        “I wouldn’t mean to.  I just, you’re going to get to be too much to stay here and I know it and I’m just glad you spent the time you did with me.”  
        “Maybe I don’t want a destiny if it’ll hurt you.”  
        Ellis looked his way again.  “Do you get to have a choice?”  
        Celyn sighed.  “Probably not.”  He squeezed Ellis’s hand and then said, “But you and Llew keep talking about leaving Clawyn.  You don’t fit either, you said.”  
        He chuckled.  “It’s true.  But that’s not the same as you.  I feel like you’d be happy here, tending the stones and making flower garlands, except that you’re.  Restless.  Because there’s a god in you now.  Or... Or whatever that’s like, I don’t know.”  He waved his other hand, then moved to cover Celyn’s with it.  “Where Llew and me, we wouldn’t be happy here, and that’s different.  Or maybe we could be happy, but it’d mean changing things we don’t want to change.”  
        Celyn nodded slowly.  “Do you know what you’d do?”  
        Ellis laughed and leaned back against the tree a little more comfortably.  “We have a thousand half-baked ideas.  I don’t know.  Maybe someday we’ll try them.  Or maybe having them will turn out to be enough.”  
        “You should fly too.  Both of you.  Like birds.  Have you ever thought about how amazing birds are?”  
  
***  
  
        There wasn’t really much call for mail to Clawyn.  Villages like that didn’t have people who sent them messages.  Which was fine, Celyn knew how it worked: send the letter to one of the inns in Nefyn and at some point someone would have reason to go to the outlying village and would bring it, or someone from Clawyn would be there and bring it home with them.  
        Celyn wrote two letters, and carefully addressed them, directing the to the Golden Sheaf in Nefyn.  Maybe the Crowther twins were still playing there on the regular; that would make things easy.  He worked out the arrangement to send the letters with a trader, who was happy to have a few coin to convey them with no particular urgency on his regular run into the market town to buy wine and other such things to take back to Tafolwern.  
        One was addressed to Olwen Bettws, Clawyn, by way of the Golden Sheaf.  
        The other was addressed to Ellis Crowther, Clawyn, also by way of the Golden Sheaf.  
        They had roughly the same content to them: that Celyn had work with a theatre troupe called Mahout’s Miracle Players, that they were leaving for Eskbridge now.  That he was working with the costumer and helping with the makeup for the performers.  That the playwright was maybe a little mad, and he felt satisfied helping there, for now.  That he was still no good at poetry, even with the playwright right there to be an example, but maybe that would change.  
        To his mother he added that she should tell Pryce everything, not that he doubted she would do so.  
        To Ellis he added that travelling shows might have a use for jugglers and musicians and whatever else, and that being twins might be a good selling point to get people to hire them on.  If they wanted another plan, for their thousand half-baked ideas, at least.  
        He added a little drawing of two birds, even though he was not good at drawing.
