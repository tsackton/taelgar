# House Rules

## Wealth and Gold

Tracking small purchases and gold available at the individual gold piece level is not interesting. Instead, all player characters are assumed to have a small pool of accessible wealth that fluctuates over time. This is assumed to cover daily expenses, food, inns, and so on as well as small income, i.e. from performing or similar activities. In true need, a player can liquidate this wealth to gain 50 gold, but if that gold is spent wealth needs to be tracked on a daily level until that 50 gold is 'paid back'

Additionally, for flavor, numerous monetary systems exist (for example [[Coinage of Sembara]], [[Dunmari Economy#Coins|Coins of Dunmar]], or [[Dwarven Coins]]). However, tracking the conversion of many different types in a realistic way is a lot of needless math, and it prevents making "interesting" monetary systems that are not easily decimalized, but which were common historically. Therefore to simplify tracking of wealth, although a treasure horde might be described as "a large pile of Sembaran royals from the reign of Bertram I", I will also give you a value in "gold pieces" for tracking, and prices will be stated in "gold pieces". The term "gold pieces" shouldn't be thought of as a specific number of actual coins, but a notation of wealth. After all we are playing Dungeons and Dragons not Treasure Hordes and Accountants. 

## Spells

In order to simplify spell-casting, the following additional rules apply:
- All cleric, paladin, and bard spells have verbal components only, and can be cast without a free hand.
- Warlock, sorcerer, and wizard spells follow the standard D&D rules, and require a free hand if they have somatic components
- No spells have material components except the following (4th and under only, will update with higher level spells later)
	- Continual Flame (a gem worth 50 gold, which is consumed)
	- Glyph of Warding (powered diamond worth 200 gold, which is consumed)
	- Revivify (diamond worth 300 gold, which is consumed)
	- Illusory Script (ink worth 10 gold)
	- Arcane Lock (golden dust worth 25 gold)
- All casters can cast ritual spells. As a note, to cast a spell as a ritual it must be prepared or known.
## Mounted Combat

> Mounted combat in D&D is a little bit unsatisfying but also designed for both simplicity and to ensure that a mounted combatant isn’t enormously more powerful than a non-mounted combatant. Here is a slight tweak to the mounted combat rules to try to keep most of the balance but make it a little bit more satisfying. 

When a mount is being ridden, the following rules apply:

- The mount acts on the same initiative count as its rider    
- The mount can move and take bonus actions as normal
- The mount may not take any actions other than Dash, Disengage, or Dodge
- The rider, when taking the Attack action, may choose to direct their mount to attack in place of their own attack. If the mount attacks, it may not take any other action  

When an enemy makes an opportunity attack against a mounted rider, they may choose whether to attack the mount or the rider. However, opportunity attacks do not apply to creatures that are moved by another creature or moved unwillingly. So this means that:

- If a mounted combatant withdraws from combat and their mount takes the Disengage action, neither mount nor rider can be targeted with an opportunity attack
- If a mounted combatant withdraws from combat and their mount does not take the Disengage action, either the mount or rider can be targeted
- There is no benefit to the rider taking the Disengage action 

#### Mounted Combatant Feat

The mounted combatant feat is changed as follows:

- You may, as a bonus action, direct their mount to attack or distract, allowing the mount to take either the Attack or Help actions    
- You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails

## Ranged Combat

As a reminder, several official rules we have not been consistent about that I will be trying to remember:
- Ranged attacks, including ranged spell attacks, have disadvantage if you are within 5’ of an enemy 
- Ranged attacks have disadvantage if you are outside the lower range of your weapon
- When targeted enemies with ranged attacks, including ranged spell attacks, if there are things in the way - including allies or other enemies - the target has half-cover (+2 to AC)
## Death and Dying

When a PC drops to 0 or fewer HP, you gain the dying condition. While you have the dying condition, the following rules apply: 

- You cannot take actions, reactions, or bonus actions
- Your speed is halved    
- You start each turn prone
- Attacks against you have advantage
- You have disadvantage on all saving throws
- At the end of your turn, if you did not take damage, you must make a DC 13 Constitution check. 
- If you fail the check, you fall unconscious. If you took damage, you also fall unconscious
- Each time you take damage while dying you suffer a wound

Once you are unconscious, you make a death saving throw each turn. On three successes, you stabilize. For each failure, you gain a wound. Once you reach 6 wounds, from a rules perspective what happens here is undefined, but in general:
- Further damage will usually result in death
- The passage of time will usually result in stabilization at 1 HP

#### Recovery from Dying

When a character regains hit points after being in the dying state, you also gain two levels of the wounded condition. Each long rest or magical healing for >50% of your hit points reduces your level of wounded by one. 
 
The effect of wounded is as follows:
* Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks
* Level 2: Speed is halved
* Level 3: Disadvantage on attack and saving throws
* Level 4: Hit point maximum halved. You cannot spend Hit Dice to regain hit points.
* Level 5: Speed is 0
* Level 6: Coma
#### NPCs and Monsters

For the vast majority of monsters and monstrous humanoids 0 HP means dead. If the plot dictates it is sensible for someone to survive, perhaps they will still be alive, but in general the default assumption is the creature dies at 0 HP. For most non-monstrous humanoids (i.e. humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk and other sentient creatures) I'll generally run 0 HP as badly wounded enough to be no longer useful on the battlefield, and let the plot and party actions dictate what exactly happens -- but usually emergency healing (magical or Medicine checks) would work to keep them alive.
## Medicine Skill and First Aid

In general, unless a character specifically doesn’t have the First Aid competency (see below), the following are allowed with 10 minutes of effort:
- Awaken an unconscious comrade 
- Keep a fallen non-monstrous humanoid from dying

The following additional actions are possible with a Medicine skill proficiency:
- As part of a long rest, reduce the number of wounds a character has by 1 (DC 10+wound level) 
- As an action, grant advantage on a Constitution check to stay conscious while dying
## Skills

We play with a simplified set of rules around skills, designed to reduce the relationship between classes and skills.  
### New Skill System

All class and race-based skill lists are eliminated, and replaced with the following table indicating how many skill proficiencies each class gets:

| Class | Proficiencies at Level 1 | Gained when multiclassing | Bonus Proficiency Levels |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Cleric | 4 | 0 |  |
| Bard | 5 | 1 | 2 at 3rd and 2 at 10th |
| Rogue | 6 | 1 | 2 at 1st and 2 at 6th |
| Warlock | 4 | 0 |  |
| Paladin | 4 | 0 |  |
| Sorcerer | 4 | 0 |  |
| Wizard | 4 | 0 |  |
| Ranger | 5 | 1 |  |

* The “Expertise” feature is eliminated
* All characters gain a bonus proficiency at 7th and 13th level.
* Humans additionally gain one bonus skill proficiency at level 1.

A skill proficiency can be spent to do one of three things:

- Become proficient in a skill 
- Become expert (twice-proficiency bonus) in a skill that you are already proficient in
- Become trained (half-proficiency bonus) in two skills  

Trained is a minor benefit except for the skills (see below) where some training is required to even attempt them.

### Research and Information Gathering

The Investigation skill (or a specific competency, like Research) can be used to discover information you don’t know. This always takes a fair bit of time, and is therefore not a substitute for History or Nature, which indicates the knowledge base your character has.

To investigate a topic, first you need to state the topic or question you will be investigating, and be in a place where there are some resources to help you. You can’t investigate the history of Semara in a dungeon in the mountains! 

Once you have started investigating, the GM will indicate:

1. The initial DC (usually between 9 and 16)
2. How long each investigation roll takes

This might vary based on specific game facts, i.e. if you know additional languages or have access to a specific library the initial DC might be lower, or the time for each roll might be lower. 

The investigation then begins, with the player making a roll. The player can continue making rolls for as long as they wish until they get two failures in a row, at which point no further information on this topic can be found.

Each success increases the DC by 2. If the roll beats the DC by 10 or more, the DC does not increase. A critical success counts as 2 successes.

In general:

- 1-2 successes means some useful information was found, but rarely anything secret or esoteric and rarely all of the information that was available
- 3-4 successes means most of the mundane information is found, and perhaps one or two unusual facts
- 5-8 successes means that all of the reasonable mundane information to be found was, and if any esoteric or secret knowledge could be discovered, it probably is
- 9+ successes would usually mean some key piece of secret knowledge is discovered beyond plausibility, i.e. you discover a hidden scroll or something

But this all depends a little bit on what information could plausibly be found. Looking for the secret name of a fey lord in a small hamlet that has never heard of the fey is not going to be successful no matter how many successes a player gets.

Once the player has decided to stop gathering information, they take a couple of hours and make one more roll - to synthesize the gathered information. The DC for this roll depends somewhat on the number of successes. The more information, the easier it is to synthesize. But it would usually be between 5 and 12, depending on the specifics. It could be higher for more esoteric information though.

The syntheses roll helps determine how accurate the information is. Obviously, some information will always be mysterious, but a very poor synthesis roll might result in 2 options that sound plausible with no idea which is correct. 

## Competencies 
In addition to skills, this house rule introduces the concept of a competency. A competency is relatively small thing (less broad than a skill) that your character knows how to do or is good at. Good competencies would include:

- Limited subsets of existing skills (“Local history of Embry”, “The rituals of the Dunmari cult of Bishma”, “Hunting”, “first aid”, “swimming”)    
- Knowledge of specific instruments,forms of entertainment (“poetry”, “lute”, “singing”)
- Random knowledge skills that don’t fit nicely into the main knowledge skills (“astronomy”, “cooking”, “geology”)
- Professional skills (“soldier”, “sailor”, “merchant”, “carpentry”)
- Unclassified abilities (“disguise”, “forgery”, “poison-making”, “gambling”)
- Random color (“wine connoisseur”, “flower arranging”, “heraldry”)

In addition, with the exception of thieves’ tools, a competency can be spent to learn any standard D&D tool proficiency, as well as any of the Taelgar-appropriate languages. 
### Starting Competencies
All characters start with 8 competencies and one language. This includes 5 “background” competencies (which replaces the 3 language/tools from a standard background) and 3 racial competencies (which replaces starting languages or tools from races). The one language is your native tongue. Note that if you wish to speak Common, you must take it with one of your competencies. 

In addition, some classes gain bonus competencies at first level or on multiclassing as per the following table (not all classes listed, let me know if anyone is considering multiclassing to an unlisted class at any point)

| Class | Bonus at Level 1 | Bonus on Multiclass |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Rogue | 2 | 1 |
| Bard | 3 | 1 |
| Druid | 2 | 0 |
| Sorcerer | 0 | 0 |
| Paladin | 0 | 0 |
| Warlock | 0 | 0 |
| Cleric | 0 | 0 |

Note however that no classes start with special languages (Thieves Cant, Druidic). These can be taken via the bonus competencies, if desired. But of course not all rogues necessary speak Thieves Cant.
#### Gaining Competencies
At 3rd level, and every other level afterwards (5th, 7th, 9th, etc) all characters gain a bonus competency. These competencies can only be gained after some plausible in-game event: downtime with a teacher, practice, etc. In some cases this might mean that the actual gain of a competency is delayed by a session or two from when the character gains a new level. In other cases, it might be that practice or training during the previous level results in getting the competency on level up.
#### Game Effect of Competencies
Most competencies act like skills: they give you proficiency bonus on some ability check you are trying to make. For many competencies, having the competency is necessary for even attempting the check. In other cases, it may be something you can do untrained. 

In you have both a skill and a competency, depending on the specific game situation, you might:
- Gain advantage on the skill check
- Not have disadvantage on the skill check (where someone without the competency would have disadvantage)
- Be able to try something with your skill that otherwise would be impossible  

In general, the idea is to apply common sense, and use the Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic as a way to avoid numbers inflation.

#### Special Competencies
A handful of abilities are things that all characters can do, but not necessarily well. This includes:  

| Competency | Game Effect if you don’t have it |
| ---- | ---- |
| Swimming | You must make a DC 8 STR check to not drown anytime you are in water over your head. You have disadvantage in situations where characters who know how to swim would make checks. |
| Climbing | You must make a DC 8 STR check to climb anything at all. You have disadvantage in situations where characters who know how to climb would make checks. |
| Reading and Writing | You can’t decipher written language nor write anything yourself |
| Arithmetic | You can’t add or subtract even small sums and are largely innumerate. You have disadvantage when haggling or selling items, and in any social situation where math might be relevant. |
| Riding | You must have a DC 8 DEX check to stay on horseback in any situation. You have disadvantage in situations where characters who know how to ride would make checks. |
| First Aid | You may not attempt to stabilize dying creatures. |
For all of these, a character by default can “do the thing”. If anyone wants their character to not be able to “do the thing”, you can take a bonus competency in exchange. Also, all of the above are eligible to be competencies, allowing you to apply your proficiency bonus to roles.

For example, all characters can swim by default, and in a situation where a check is needed, would make a straight STR check. If anyone wants to not be able to swim, you can note “unable to swim” on your character sheet and take a bonus competency instead. 

If you want to be good at all athletics skills, you should take Athletics. But if you wanted to be JUST good at swimming, you could take the Swimming competency which would then allow you to add your proficiency bonus to your STR check when swimming only.
