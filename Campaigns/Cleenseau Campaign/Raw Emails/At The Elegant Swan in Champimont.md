We flash back to yesterday evening, before departing Champimont, in  
the back room of the Elegant Swan. The party has quieted down some,  
and plans have been discussed, and in the back room, conversation has  
turned to magic.  
  
%%Tim, my brother, will be playing the part of Tristan; I assume  
Viepuck, Izgil, and Celyn are participating and Robin is not - Dan  
please shout if you want us to wait for Robin's input. This is really  
intended to kick off the conversation; it would be fine for any of you  
to just ask questions back to him, but I didn't want to overly dictate  
the starting point of the conversation%%
  
Sitting around the table are Celyn, the young Tyrwinghan, in his  
leather armor; Viepuck, no longer disguised as a dwarf, now appearing  
as the almost-teen he actually is; Izgil, the dwarf in truth, with his  
white beard and stories of the moon; and Tristan, in fine green and  
black robes, with his almost-yellow eyes.  
Tristan has spent the evening mostly avoiding talking about himself,  
although he did talk about the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter, in  
an aside, in a way that implied he remembered it - although he  
certainly doesn't like the 50-something years old that would imply.  
  
Tristan looks around, and starts the conversation: "Miracles" (looking  
at Celyn), "undetectable illusions" (looking at Viepuck), "the moon"  
(looking at Izgil). "You have many tales I think of strangeness and  
magic. I would talk with you a while, if you can spare an hour despite  
the upcoming dawn, and hear more of these miracles and magics you can  
control. Or even just speculate, in honor of the Sibyl, as the wise  
and foolish both do, on the true nature of magic, together."

There is a long pause here while Celyn visibly is chewing on phrasing of something, or perhaps the underlying concept, but he does eventually speak - slowly, like he’s picking his way through thornbushes.  “I have been doing a lot of thinking about, about… the difference between a miracle and other sorts of magic.  The feel of opening to allow the miracle to pass through is… it’s different than the things *I* do.”  
  
His hands twitch a little and he eventually gets control of that by picking up a fork and tapping it against his other hand in a syncopated rhythm.  “So where’s the line between a miracle and other sorts of magic.  Is the miracle, the Sibyl’s quiet miracle, that the other magic could be learned _at all_?  Because it’s, it’s definitely different to _do_.  Things that come from the Wyrdling, and things that come from me."  
  
He looks like he might have said something else, but then stops, perhaps a little abruptly; that was actually rather a lot for him on this topic, and he’s visibly a bit awkward about talking about it.  But, on the other hand, Tristan probably has lots of ideas about this, and he cannot resist finding out what some of those might be.

Tristan looks at Celyn thoughtfully. His eyes seem to dim a little, from a pale yellow to almost white, as he begins to speak: "What is a miracle, really?" He moves his hands in a smooth flowing gesture, and you see the beer in his mug rise up. It spirals into the shape of a simple wand, with a sleek shaft that twists into a spirally, corkscrew-like design, subtly hinting at the shape of a heart, perhaps.  %%You recognize this immediately, as a representation of the Sibyl's wand%%

"The Sibyl is in everything I do, even these small tricks of magic, of course. I can feel the vast, indescribable well of her power, just out of reach. The enormity of it, the feeling of..." Tristan pauses for a moment, uncertain, searching for a word. "the force of it? pressure? I am not sure how to find the words to describe it. It is like...I have heard tales that on the great peaks of the Sentinels, where there is always snow, sometimes the mountains shake the snow loose and it comes rushing in a great wave of cold, swallowing everything in its path. I feel as if the Sibyl's power is that wave, and the true miracle is that she protects me, allowing only an infinitesimal trickle of her power to flow through me, for me to shape and use. Even that is hard enough to bear, at times."

Tristan grows thoughtful, as if remembering something. The beer returns to the mug, and Tristan's eyes shift back to pale yellow. 

"This is different, I think, from what you describe as the Wyrdling's miracles. The Sibyl's teachings make it clear that the Divines cannot act in the material world except through the souls of sentient creatures, which is why we teach that miracles are gifts to humanity, for which we give thanks, and not spells done to us. For me, this power does not always feel like a gift, but the way you talk makes me feel you perhaps have a different relationship with the Wyrdling's power than I do with the Sibyl's. Do you feel the Wyrdling's power all the time, pressing at you, threatening to break out and consume you utterly? Or is it just in the moment of prayer itself that they reach through you to act in the world and grant you a blessing?"

Celyn leans back, continuing to drum with the fork against his hand, because he does that sort of thing when he’s distracted.  After some consideration he says, “The first miracle I experienced was the one by which I was _not_ consumed utterly by the fact of being out of season, the one that gave me the grace to know myself rather than to feel myself furious about the wrongness of my being.  My *life* is the miracle I live constantly, the wonder of it, the gift of it.”  
  
He stops the fidgeting, sets the fork down, but it glows, now, with miraculous light, like that shimmers and pulses a little erratically, shifting in color in rainbow coruscations.  Disco fork.  He gestures at it, as if that should explain everything, while he searches for more words.  “I am made for light in dark places.  The Wyrdling, they are the light that keep me from my own dark places.  I live in the tension between how I choose to be and what I am capable of, and I choose wonder, I choose hope, I accept my fate, however it may come.  The Wyrdling is my foundation, the shifting ground upon which I rebuilt myself.”  
  
This is rather deeper than the rest of the party has heard from him, given that he is usually just amiably perky and perhaps comes across as a little bit stoned most of the time.  But then again, nobody’s actually much gotten him talking _religion_.  
  
“If I am consumed, then that is my destiny, and I accept that.  It does not,” he pauses.  “It doesn’t bother me?  It’s not something I spend my time on?  I look for the point, the spot where things can be changed, I act there, with the tools fate and chance have given me.  Is that any less the Wyrdling’s miracle when it is my swordtip than when I call their light?  I can’t believe it is less.  Because it’s me, and my life is a miracle.  I can’t untangle that.  I’m not sure if trying would be ungrateful, anyway.”  
  
He flicks his fingers again, and a ghostly half-illusion of a hand plucks up the fork and starts to spin it in place; he has found a way of fidgeting with it *magically* now.  Just for variety.  (If Tristan is still maintaining the det magic he cast before it will confirm the blatantly obvious thing that mage hand is not clerical magic.)

  Viepuck won’t be the first to speak, and will start when he does with “I apologize, the table here contains some knowledgable and skilled theoreticians of magic, more so than I, who has mostly been taught a few simple tricks and little of the underlying flow of how they work.  As such my interpretations may seem foreign or inaccurate.  With luck I may be granted some insight to provide.”

V: “Like your strings are being plucked?  Rather than singing yourself?”

V: “That seems terribly dangerous.  Hepy (Tristan will recognize this as a Patron reference, but not the full name (he had asked for location-of-origin before, not name, and this is obviously a nickname of the sort you would give your favorite aunt, lighthearted and perky but with deep adoration and respect) said we are very fragile and so can only do small magics.  Forcing too much through us can cause damage. That’s why I was taught not plucked."

V: "That sounds about right?  Hepy said that trying to come too close to look around directly would tear…. No, basil isn’t the right word…. Nutmeg…”. Viepuck is trying to translate a concept that was explained in probably not a language and will mutter for a moment in various food metaphors…. “Something sandwichy?… but with crunch.  Anyway, it would be bad to break you would get tomatoes everywhere and they sound terrible."

V: "Tristan, you have a very unique experience on the world.  Usually I don’t bother asking, but there is a spell that helps Hepy learn about the world and Sybil seems someone that should be introduced.  You might be able to help that?  Do you mind?”

Celyn’s more usual perky attitude immediately manifests here.  “I’m very fond of the miracles that people have forgotten are miracles.  But I come from vineyard people who recognize the Mother in the way blossom becomes fruit.”  He waves a hand a little airily; about here is when the mage hand gives out and he catches the falling fork with his other hand without looking at it.  “We tell the stories about pruning back the leaves, tending the vines, and such, but I think most people have forgotten that this isn’t just ‘teaching people how to tend the vines’, it’s reminding the miracle how to grow.”

As Tristan listens to Celyn and Viepuck talk, about miracles large and small and the story of the Wanderer's miracle on the bridge, he smiles, a bit wistfully, and for a moment it seems as if the eyes that look out of his face are those of a much older person. 

  

"Indeed, the stories of the big miracles are the ones we tell to help us remember the blessings of the gods. I am sure the legend of the Wanderer's blessing on the bridge will grow with the telling. Perhaps one day in the future the people of Cleenseau will celebrate that victory with a festival to mark the occasion, even. But I wonder if the small miracles have a greater force. I have talked to many people about miracles, and it seems many feel as you do, Celyn. Their miracles lay easy on them: a gift of the you you didn't realize you could be, the blessing of knowing how to live as your truest self. I think the gods choose the people they grant the power to channel their prayers to carefully. I do not think it sounds hard, exactly. Well, except that sometimes the journey is hard, to being true to yourself, to upholding the trust the gods place in you."

  

He pauses for a minute, gathering his thoughts. 

  

"I think many things can be miracles. The gods work in mysterious ways, and even those who do not directly channel their power through prayers and magic may perform miracles, in their own way. The true miracle, I think, is the gift of ourselves the gods give us."

He pauses again, uncertain, continuing hesitantly. 

"This is what I have struggled with the most, I must admit, for when I came into my power, it was not a revelation, not a blessing of finding myself and uncovering my true power. My very being was consumed, utterly, and for a moment I was lost completely in the vast crushing weight of the Sibyl's power, overwhelmed by fragments of memories and dreams not my own, forcing themselves into my mind. I have spent the past decade trying to understand that moment, and how it changed me, and I am not sure I am any closer to understanding the Sibyl's purpose for me, or what happened that night."

He sighs, slowly. 

"I am not sure why I am telling you this. Perhaps because this must be among the strangest collection of magic users that have gathered in one room in Champimont for some time."  

Lost in thought for a moment, he turns back to Viepuck. 
  
"Earlier, you mentioned something about a spell, and meeting the Sibyl? What did you mean by that?"

V: “There’s a ‘…walks into a bar’ joke in there somewhere, but it has been a long day and I for once lack the wit to find it easily.  Or my attention is elsewhere.”

V: “Not…. Us meeting the Sibyil, per se.  One of my functions for Hepy is to gather information, as people are new and interesting to experience.  There’s a sort of a spell (maybe it’s a spell?  I don’t really know what qualifies as a spell in the grand scheme of things, and with talk of miracles vs magic that doesn’t particularly help clarify matters) that opens the mind and conveys that experience. Not invasive, really you barely notice it’s happened.  But also I’ve been told that when some are particularly close to the more potent entities of the world, gods or great fey or such, it can act as something of an introduction or maybe calling-card between them.”

  

“As I said, normally it’s not the type of thing I bother asking, as it can be mildly beneficial to the recipient, but I figured that in the context of magical discussion it was at least polite to ask.”

Celyn murmurs a soft, “Poor Robin,” in here; the habitual smile has a sort of sympathetic melancholy to it for a moment.

“Given where I was when I was put on the journey, I can only believe that for me, at least, it’s easier than the alternative.  People give me such confused looks when I say I found peace with the Wyrdling but,” he shrugs, “I did."

Celyn has started fidgeting with the fork again; the rhythm that he taps with it is unreasonably complicated, but at least he’s doing it against his palm rather than the table, where the noise might be irritating.  “She gave you a deep need to _know_, which seems about right?” he offers, after a moment.

Celyn snorts at Viepuck’s not-quite-a-joke and tosses his glowing fork into the air again, this time catching it with a new mage hand and once again setting it spinning like a propeller.  He lets the conversational bits regarding Viepuck’s patron wash past him; he is apparently staring into the mystery of the cantrip.

While waiting for whatever magic Viepuck is about to do to commence, Tristan turns back to Celyn with a wry smile. "Well, yes. I am not sure if giving me the need to know, but not the answers, or, apparently, the means to find them is the Sibyl's idea of a joke, or if I just have not found the right way to ask. I have not found my peace, not yet at least. I am glad you have found yours, though."

I have not found my peace, not yet at least. I am glad you have found yours, though.”  
  
“I suppose peace depends on how troubled you are when you start,” Celyn says philosophically, catching the fork out of the air again.  He has very quick hands.  Possibly this is related to the drumming habit.  
  
“In the spirit of *knowing*, though.  When I become a conduit for a miracle, it’s … I have to hold the shape of it, so it can pass through me, correctly, without…”  Words are hard.  “Without burning?  I am a gateway, to allow it to happen.”  Again the fork tossed into the air, again caught with a cantrip.  “When I do other magic, that’s not a— uh.  Direct? Miracle? It’s not passing through me, it’s a thing I do, that I summon up myself.  Not that different from drawing a bow, where I am also drawing up my own power.  The trick to those spells isn’t in holding the space, it’s the—“  He shoots Viepuck an amused look here, and offers, “flavor, I guess,” to conclude it.  
  
He adds, “I bet Izgil does it a whole different way too.  He probably doesn’t have to remember how to feel like the moon to do what he does.  But he prefers what he does to make _sense_.”  There’s a sort of amusement, at that, like Celyn considers it a reasonably futile goal, but hey, you do you, Izgil.  
  
“But which is it more like for you?  The miraculous magic or other kinds?  That’s what I’ve been thinking a lot about lately.  Miracles, finding magic, the way it’s different when I do it and when _they_ do it through me.  It’s probably a weird question.” Another shrug; weird questions are of course normal, but he waves a hand at Viepuck and Izgil to include them in the broader query.  
  
  
(Poor Matt is gonna have so much to read when he gets his power back. :D )

V:  “Ok…. Done.”  You note no movement, no change of expression or sound required.  

Net effect for you: a moment of almost a bit of flashback on various life events and a sudden burst of recall and personal insight.  Gain Advantage on your next INT check.  

Net effect NOT for you: your entire mind and memory has been scanned and uploaded to an off world entity.  Including methods-of-contact for any entities you might regularly be in contact with.  What happens from there is entirely off-character-screen.  

  

Mike would have to determine if there was anything else.

Tristan shakes himself, as if waking up from a memory. His eyes are almost completely white. "Ah, that was...strange." [referring to Viepuck's ability / spell]. He takes a moment to gather himself and his thoughts. 

  

"After I came into my power, but before I met Vaihaya and their companions, I spent some time in Tollen, to the north, trying to learn, at the Temple of the Sibyl there. Ah, that was a place! Seeing the sun shine through the stained glass windows, the rainbows of color dancing across the tiled marble floors, that was something else. The priests there, they could see I had power, clearly, and not the skill or wisdom to use it. They kept trying to teach me the way that The Sibyl had taught them. To twist your soul into the proper shape to allow the miracles of the Sibyl to flow from her Divine Realm to our material world, much as you describe, Celyn. I was a puzzle to them, I think, because this never worked for me. No matter how hard I tried, the shape would come out wrong. Either nothing would happen, or the wrong thing."
  

"I met another pilgrim there, a young man blessed with great potential. Godfrey, was his name, from some small village in Sembara, Marburgh I think. The soul-shapes came easy to him, but he took pity on me, and tried to help. I remember fondly our long walks along Gold Street by the Volta, past the merchant estates, talking into the night. It was from these talks that I came to realize the truth at the heart of it all: magic, simply, is the application of extraplanar power to our material world. The prayers and soul-shapes and miracle conduits my masters had been trying to teach me were all about the channel, creating the means for the Divine energy to reach us. Miracles are easy for the Divine, effortless even - we just need to become a passage for that energy to flow."

  

"My problem was different. I could feel the Divine energy pressing on me, consuming me, all the time. It was -- still is -- incessant, endless. Almost as if I was somehow a conduit myself, just by being. There was no need for me to channel the Divine presence, to summon the Sibyl to me with prayer and soul-shapes. She was there, always, holding back the flood of energy that constantly threatens to consume me. What I needed, I realized, was to learn how to twist this energy myself. How to make things out of it. The Sibyl would not shape it for me. Maybe this is more like the other magic you do, Celyn. I don't know."

  

"It's like. Hmm. My parents were shoemakers in Tafolwern, and I grew up with the smell of leather and the sound of stiching and pounding, watching shoes take shape from raw leather and thread. I loved the feeling of holding something blank and unfinished in your hands, and being able to see and feel it turn into something new. I think I would have been a good shoemaker, if fate and the Sibyl hadn't taken me in a different direction. But when I do magic, it feels the same, like a craft, like there is this deep well of eternal energy flowing through me, and if I can just learn to control it, to shape it, using my mind instead of a knife and awl, I can do anything."

  

"It has not been easy, though, this learning. I have learned more from Vaihaya than I expected. Their elven magic seems effortless, a subtle twist, the gentlest of touches, from what source I know not. For me each small measure of control has been hard-won, a great struggle."

  

Tristan trails off a bit at this point, clearly having found himself speaking a little more openly than he might have expected, perhaps a lingering effect of the flood of memories brought about by Viepuck's magic.

Celyn lets the pause here go for a little while before saying, “… like a millrace, then, where the water is channeled from a difficult stream so that it can make things turn.  She divides the channel from the rapids for you, but you have to do the work of building the mill and making it go.”  
  
He considers and then speaks slowly again.  “I learned my other magic from the fey. In the Mostreve Hills.  Starting when I was a child.  More recently… more… I suspect by the Wyrdling’s grace.  Since it was in dreaming.”  A pause, another ridiculous twirl of the fork.  “It was … difficult.  I got teased a lot over it, for being unable to do the simplest things as the fey reckon them.  But I already thought more like them than most people, it’s why I was apprenticing to walk the boundaries and mind the standing stones and make sure that when a tree got felled the right compensation was paid.  Eventually I got the trick to it, the twist.  But I don’t have a millrace.  I just have me, and what I’ve come to understand of fey tricks and charms.  Maybe … the twist, that makes me a little more like them, opens the space for that, um.  Extraplanar power. That mortals don’t usually do.”  He glances at Izgil here.  Izgil has talked about ‘extraplanar’ and stuff like that, which is all a bit beyond him.  
  
Perhaps he’s sharing this in the spirit of recognizing that unexpected openness.  Perhaps he’s sharing this because he expects another Tyrwinghan might understand.  
  
He catches the fork as it drops and with a twist of his hands, it vanishes; even the light is hidden.

Tristan glances up at the mention of the fey, curious. "I wonder, if perhaps my magic is more akin to your fey tricks, than the miracles of the Wyrdling. Raw power, even Divine power, isn't enough, after all; I needed to learn the trick of it to make anything of that power, at least anything more than a nasty headache and bad dreams for myself...."

  

"I did actually ask a fae about magic, once. When I was in Tollen, I met a fae woman named Caelynn. Her house was grand, and strange in that fey way, but also utterly unlike anything I was used to from back home. She was from some fey realm far to the west, I think; she didn't feel a part of the city, not the way I expected. The fey back home feel part of the land, you know? Like they belong. She didn't, not exactly."

  

He continues. "In any case, I thought maybe she could help me understand my power, but she just laughed, and told me if carrying a fragment of The Sibyl's soul was too much of a burden, she knew someone who would take it from me. She spoke at length, then, about the ties between planes and how the fey carried their magic with them, and how I was kind of like a fey in that regard. I didn't rightly understand much of what she said, to be honest, it was a lot of talk of magical creatures and the fey and their magic and the magic of the Feywild. I think perhaps she found my confusion amusing."

  

"But it never occured to me that one could just....learn fey magic. But then again, all of you seem to have found your magic by unusual paths."

  

Tristan pauses again, and takes a deep drink from his mug.

Celyn, visibly amused by the concept of a fae who uses a name so similar to his own, nods at this.

“Fragment of a god’s soul?  … I guess that would have to be an, uh, plane thing.”  Celyn is wholly out of his element when it comes to this level of theory.

“I’m not sure how common it is to be able to? I bet more Tyrwinghans could than other people, obviously, but even at home people commented about how they like me a lot.”  Celyn shrugs.  “I expect a lot comes down to whether or not they’d be interested enough in any given mortal to bother with it as much or even more than natural, what’s the word.  Um.”   
  
The word is ‘aptitude’.  He makes a vague gesture with his hand, unable to bring the word to mind, though as he does the glowing fork reappars in his grasp, and he spins it around his fingers.
