[meta: this is more of a roleplaying opportunity but it could definitely impact the plot, so worth trying to finish up before next game]

  

The Duke's command tent is fine and functional, and as the afternoon light wanes Celyn, Robin, and Viepuck find themselves gathered in the back of the tent, along with about dozen clerks, guards, courtiers, and hangers-on. The Duke is holding court, and Marcel, the captain of the guard, has invited the party for an audience when the court's business has finished. 

  

The Duke starts with an announcement. He, and his immediate court will be departing for Embry as the sun sets, with urgent business with the King. He is leaving behind Marcel and three regimental captains, and the bulk of the army, to help reestablish order along the Enst. He is bringing a small contingent with him to Embry, and sending home the soldiers he borrowed from the least prepared places. He reads a missive, to his barons and lords, which he is distributing far and and wide, which reads, slightly summarized: 

  

Protect your people, and keep them safe. Guard your lands and homes and villages. Make sure the crops are planted come spring. I am your liege and your lord, and if anyone, be they monster, fairy, god, or king orders you to do else, to leave your people unguarded, send for me.

  

He seems furious at the lose of life the skeletons caused, and more so the mismanagement of it.

  

[Meta: Within the Duchy of Wisford, the Duke is sworn to the king, but the barons of Wisford are sworn to the Duke. Outside the duchies, the barons are sworn directly to the king. So some barons are feudal vassals of the Duke, whereas other barons are feudal vassals of the King direct. He is speaking here to his vassals - which notably, **does not** include Cleenseau or Aveil]

  

With that announcement, he announces his only official order of court business: resolving the disputed succession of the Barony of Fellburn. At this point the twins you saw earlier on the wall, Lord Hubert Moreau and his sister, Lady Elise Moreau, step forward. Whatever retinues they had brought with them don't seem to be around, and the Duke turns to Lord Moreau.

  

"Lord Hubert, you stand accused of dereliction of duty and unfitness to lead. Your sister claims that despite your father's wish that you inherit, your actions in the recent difficulties directly led to your father's death, and thus prove you are unfit for this solemn responsibility." The Duke pauses, and holds Lord Moreau's eyes. "Your family has served mine for four generations. We stood together under the Singing Tree and heard the song of hope, after your mother died. You carry my grandfather's sword. I owe you. You owe me. Before the gods and my court tell me what is true." The Duke's speech is compelling, you can feel the weight of his command, his loyalty, the power of his voice. He is _good_ at this. 

  

Lord Moreau holds the Duke's eye for a minute, then bows his head. "I cannot deny the charge, although", he glances at this sister, "some would not have spread the tale so widely" (clearly, he is somewhat bitter at her). And so he tells a tale of mishap and misfortune. The details are not overly important, but the gist is that he panicked in the first moments, when the skeletons started rising, and fled, and ordered the gates of the city closed while farmers in the fields, and, his father, visiting one the family estates were kept out and slaughtered by the skeletons. It was only after his father's death, and as the death toll grew, that his sister and several others countermanded him and rode out to rescue who they could.

  

His story is slow to be told, with some excuses, and hemming and hawing. At the end, the Duke is silent for a moment. He looks saddened more than anything. He asks if Elise, or anyone else wishes to speak, and the scattered folks are quite. Elise only says, softly:  "Don't forget my father is dead." Which seems to pierce Hubert's heart as she speaks, and he looks pained.

  

The Duke glances up at that, a flash of emotion - perhaps anger? - on his face, and after another moment he continues. 

  

"This is my judgement: The Barony of Fellburn shall fall to Lady Elise Moreau, may she serve in honor and health. Lord Moreau, I judge your actions foolish and ill, and yes, cowardly, but not, I think, treasonous. I sentence you thus: leave here with your horse and sword and a hundred doubles [meta: ~150 gp]. Find bravery and better judgement in the wide world. Return to me at Wisford when you are wiser. Until then, you must not be seen in the Duchy. Should you not accept this judgement, you may appeal to the royal court, as is your right" He pauses again and ends more softly. "I hope you find wholeness and healing as well. I have not forgotten your father is dead."

  

After this memorable seen, most of the courtiers and scribes disperse, to carry out the Duke's commands, and make the camp ready to leave, when Marcel presents you to the Duke:

  

"Your Highness, may I present Celyn, of Tyrwingha, Robin, of Abenfyrd in Tyrwingha, and Viepuck, of Embry, Robin's page. All lately from Cleenseau, where they have gained some acclaim for their deeds. This one" he points at Robin "is blessed of the Wanderer and slew a monstrous large skeleton with the strength of his devotion, I hear."

  

The Duke looks up, and murmurs a few words of thanks. "My gratitude for your actions, both hear and across the realm. The duchy is of course my primary responsibility, but all good souls must pull together in these times. If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know, although I must hurry to Embry. Will you be returning to Cleenseau? Is Wymar Essford still lord there? He knew my father, in the wars."

Celyn gives a sidelong look at Robin at that, somewhat wry and sympathetic.

“Lord Wymar is one of those who was afflicted with a wasting illness of the mind, so while he governs, it is very much in name only now,” Celyn says immediately, because he has an angle to something he cares about here.  “His daughter Rosalind is his regent, but was summoned to Embry not long before one of the larger assaults upon the town.  As we have noticed has been the case for others who have been called away.”  He puts in a pause here, but from the Duke’s distribution of troops earlier in the meeting he is clear that the Duke is _well aware_ that this is a pattern.  Including here, at the skeleton war, hence the hurry.  
  
After a breath he continues, "Rinault is currently managing things for his sister, but since Robin is the greater portion of his good sense, we do intend to return soon. We wanted to see the roads clear again.”  If Rinault didn’t want to have a reputation for being a hotheaded fool he should perhaps have made better choices in life.  
  
“Despite the current clearness of the roads, I do suspect that there are no paths from here that do not go into danger.  In these unsettling circumstances, sir, will you accept a blessing of the Wyrdling, for protection in the face of risk, and hope for the future?"

The Duke glances up at this comment with interest, his eyes bright and his attention more fully on Celyn. But he doesn’t say anything other than: “I met Lady Rosalind once. A fine leader. “

The Duke: “I have asked the Father daily to carry my prayers to the Wanderer, for safe journeys, to the Wyrdling, for hope, and to the Warlord for courage. I would be honored to have your blessings join mine. “

Celyn nods acknowledgement here and does not pursue the matter of people being called away further: he has sown the necessary chaos into this situation and poking it further will not help.  The Duke got it; that’s what matters.  
  
>> “Despite the current clearness of the roads, I do suspect that there are no paths from here that do not go into danger.  In these unsettling circumstances, sir, will you accept a blessing of the Wyrdling, for protection in the face of risk, and hope for the future?

Celyn has spent all his levelled spells and it’s not like there’s a _specific spell_ for a blessing anyway, but he has his devotion to bring regardless, and the shimmering internal light that he is always aware of as the presence of his god.  He takes several careful, centering breaths, and something changes about him; he has, at times, been serious, but he has almost never been, well… focused.  At least not outside of combat, when he tends to rapid flurries of pinpoints of literally piercing attention.  
  
All of that scattered attention is now gathered in place, with all the tension of a drawn bow about it, and he cups his hands together, as if to catch something in them.  There’s a near-silent whisper of, “Wyrdling hear me and let me open to your blessings,” reverent and earnest and with a humming intensity to it; he has *strong feelings about this situation*.  Then he speaks, more loudly and clearly, “May fortune favor and speed your travels, may luck keep you safe, and may hope bring you and your people back home.  As we are all out of season and out of place in this time of troubles, may their blessing shelter you and your people until spring is again spring and autumn is again autumn, until the summer’s sun ripens the grain in its proper time and the winter’s night offers peaceful rest."  
  
He spreads his hands, then, centering the gesture on the Duke, but expanding it to encompass the people remaining with him, his household and immediate retainers who are travelling with him to Embry.  
  
Regardless of whether anything _happens_ other than his words, he steps back with a little bow, now silent and visibly exhausted as he settles back near Robin and lets the paladin and Viepuck add whatever they want to contribute to the conversation.  Celyn will absolutely overcommit his energy to things when he thinks they matter, after all.

From Dan:

At the mention of being Rinault's "good sense", Robin looks like he'd rather be almost anywhere else.  
  
If we think we've got the main topics covered (I guess we mostly just wanted to impart our concerns about all the leadership being pulled away at critical times), I guess there's not a lot more to add other than Robin offering his well wishes to the Duke as well. It feels like this would be a good opportunity to bring up important stuff, but I guess I can't really think of anything unless others have thoughts.

Duke, I wish you good luck but also urge you to caution of which you are surely aware is needed in Embry.  The timing of all these events, letters we have seen to the Western Army from the king providing orders which actively weakened defenses there, called away the garrison at Cleanseau a week before we were attacked there…. It is conjecture, but it all seems so well coordinated.  

  

I fear that it may not be a mere lack of governing skill that affects the king, I fear that his gathering of nobles is as much a trap and a ploy to weaken the lands around.  I don’t know whether he is making these orders directly or in secret service to another, but so many changes so fast lead us to believe that someone there knows 

  

Be cautious, even moreso than you believe you need to be, with your reputation as a hero here and elsewhere you may be a bigger target that you think, an obvious point of rally against the chaos that could be controlled with any number of charges brought up for being competent while being ordered not to…. 

  

If she is still there Lady Rosalind will surely be an ally, but also I suspect anyone who tries maintain stability in contrast to the king’s orders may be in danger.

So we may want to make a foray to Aveil at some point.  Though it would be nice to hear from Rosalind first….

Interesting that he wasn’t affected by the sickness that hit so many of the other lords?  Do we have a rough map of the radius-of-effect on that?

(This is precisely the skill that I want to point out to him above is going to make him a target of a possible non-human court influence in Embry - he’s good enough to be a competent rival and rallying point in times of trouble)

Viepuck will not comment directly on any of this, but having talked to him on the way over, and probalby not much of this having come out, will sort of bow-head-into-hand-in-disappoitnment.

I would want to consult with the party first, but basically: if he has nowhere to go but can fight, we’re looking for anyone we can for armies/garrisons at Cleenseau?  He could fit in there, starting under Ada, arrive as an unknown we have met not a former lord, and work up?  He’s been raised to command but fearful of it, so perhaps starting by learning to take orders in the face of danger…. 

  

My fear is that he might get involved with Rinault’s drinking crew and that would go poorly.  

  

Thoughts before the offer is made?  Does he have armor or other possessions or anything or is this basically “you’re cast out with what you’re carrying”?

I think the biggest thing he can do for us is to make sure that he watch his back in Embry…. 

  

And to continue fighting to organize and protect the people, a reminder that nobility is defined by one’s actions, not by one’s title.  

(This may irk Hubert and get a positive emotional nod from his sister if they’re still there.  This is not unintentional, as I’m hoping to drag him Cleenseau-ward and have more time there).

 Nothing visible happens. But Celyn feels a sense of dread, like his prayer is a small piece of cloth, flapping in the wind, wholly inadequate to protect the Duke from the storm that surrounds him.

(Feel free to share, or not. I've intentionally sent just to Celyn)

Explanations can wait until after the audience.

There is certainly a moment after the audience when Viepuck could approach the Duke, if not exactly alone, certainly with only a few trusted retainers around, as he is, for example, getting ready to ride, and have a few quiet words. He patiently thanks Viepuck for the warning, and the information. He is certainly gracious, but he adds: "Yes, the dead rising is an unusual danger, and it seems, targeted - although perhaps not at me. I am well aware of the dangers facing the realm, and my eyes are open, and my spirit ready for what fate may bring."

As far as you know, it was mostly scattered small border lords in the Barony of Aveil and the borderlands south of the Enst, largely between Cleenseau and Rinburg, with some scattered reports as far north as the Aine Hills, and as far west as Fellburn (but only south of the Enst). Your information was mostly from Eremon, who was investigating this prior to coming to Cleenseau. This was all about a year ago now.

The implication of "horse and sword" is not literally just a horse and sword, but equipment - armor, bow, horse, sword, tent, bedroll, etc. He just isn't allowed to take more wealth than 100 doubles (which is for "double crowns" and is worth about 150gp). You don't know exactly what sort of equipment he'd have but you can assume a baron's heir would likely have decent chain armor, at least, or plate if they were particularly invested in being a military leader, crossbow or longbow, arrows, spear, sword, a shield, a couple of daggers, and other miscellaneous useful equipment. 

  

You could certainly catch up with Hubert and talk to him, he is heading back to the city to gather his things, but he would be easy to find, or easy for a messenger to find if you wanted to send him a note.

The Moreau twins have left at this point, the audience with the Duke is semi-private (not literally just you and the Duke, but those not part of his travelling entourage are gone, unlike the prior events with the Moreaus, which was more in the nature of an open court/call to judgement). But the Duke nods at the sentiment, and with a bit of a fierce unhappy smile, adds: "Fear not. I am hard to kill."
