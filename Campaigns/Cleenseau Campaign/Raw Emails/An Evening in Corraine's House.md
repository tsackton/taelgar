An hour after sunset, the meal, cooked by unseen hands eaten, and plans for the next day discussed, quiet settles over the table.  
  
Armand, stands, excusing himself with a brief apology: "I wish to say my prayers to the night, and prepare for tomorrow. I wish you good rest." Odo was uncomfortable all evening, being served by an unseen servant, and, looking withdrawn and a little homesick, stands, stammering: "I th-thi-think I would bed now, please, if I may."  
  
Corrine waves her hand, and a glowing arrow appears on the wall, pointing the way to the kitchen, the warmest place downstairs to sleep, and Odo nervously follows it.  
  
And so five are left sitting around the table: Viepuck, no longer disguised as a dwarf; Celyn; Robin; Emilie, looking fascinated and starry-eyed; and Corrine, elegant now in her clean robes, with an air of power and about her.  
  
Corrine gestures and the unseen servant starts to clear the table. Into the silence, she speaks: "Thank you again, Robin, and Celyn, for the healing. I appreciate your encouragement in helping Armand get over his fears." She glances at the lantern, which has been sitting on the table (at her encouragement) during dinner.  
  
"That is quite a soothing light. It.. showed... " (she seems unsure if this is the right word) ".. me that some fears are not true. As did the divine grace of your healing - all of your healing, the Wyrdling, the Wanderer, and the Night Queen. A truly blessed group."  
  
She continues. "I feel I owe you an explanation, at least a brief one. My nightmare, you see, is unwilling transformation. Those poor dead fisherfolk, transformed partly to eels." She shudders. "Ever since I was a little girl I've known transformation was possible. I was born in a boy's body. Transformed, even at birth. It fascinated me, as I grew up, the possibilities of transformation, of metamorphosis, of the inner and outer selves. I was curious. I went searching, looking for answers to this mystery of transformation. And in the many books, there are of course tales: the fey and the wizards of Chardon, yes. But also terrors: The werewolves of the Mad One. The perversion of life into undeath. The hag who turns you to a worm. It has been a difficult day, and in my delirious state I was not quite sure I wasn't turning into an eel myself. I feared to spread it to anyone else." She looks herself over: "All cured, by your blessing, now, though".  
  
She pauses, and then continues: "I would dearly love to hear more of that lantern and where it came from. Or how four such remarkable people came to be sitting here. But of course, the hospitality of my house is yours, should you prefer to rest. Or if would you wish tea, or other further refreshment, please just ask.”  
  
%% Other possible hooks for conversation could be her artwork - there are four notable pieces in the room, an intimate portrait of a man’s body with a woman’s head, mid transformation hanging above the hearth; two silver sculptures of  cat turning into a bird and a bird turning into a cat, decorating her chair; a tapestry of all manner of   
chimerical beasts; a delicate wooden carving of centaur, sitting as a centerpiece on the table %%
  
Side note, Robin would know that Corrine means "maiden or girl" in Drankorian, and Morphokamia sounds derived from the Drankorian word for transformation ("morph") and work or toil ("kamia"), i.e. "Morph" is embedded there on purpose. It is unusual and sounds like a chosen name which would mean something like Shape Toiler or Transformation Worker or similar.

From Kiya:
Contextual thing the party could have noticed:  
  
Celyn in the initial meeting with Corinne did have, perhaps, some of the culturally expected caution about a wizard, though honestly not a lot of it, because of course Celyn is at ‘You’re a wizard?  Oh, okay!’ about _that_ too.  When he went to get the tea, there was a moment where he paused and then clearly realized *something*, after which point his attitude towards Corinne had shifted to ’sympathy and perhaps something else’ and he got very intense about letting the Wyrdling heal her.

Celyn watches Odo go and shakes his head slightly, with a murmured, “I suspect this is rather a lot for him, particularly when he’s having such a terrible time.”  (If Corinne asks he will add, “He’s from Eftly.”)

In here, Celyn chuckles softly and murmurs, “Okay, I was only _mostly_ right."

At the ‘I would love to hear more about that lantern’, Celyn looks over at Robin with a little grin, because he has heard a _little_ of this story and is clearly hoping that Robin might share More Story.

Viepuck will make sure to wish Odo a good sleep, (also ask if he is having difficulty sleeping at all after Efly.  I have some things that can help with that if you need rest, we have a big day tomorrow).

But of course, the hospitality of my house is yours, should you prefer to rest. Or if would you wish tea, or other further refreshment, please just ask.”  
  
It will take a while before Viepuck starts really talking to Corrine much directly, and will start with an apology.  
  
“Corrine, I wish to thank you not only for your hospitality but for an unintended transformation you have performed.  I have had some of the common Sembaran adversity to associations with wizards, though in my case from at least a more personal cause then reinforced…  Your willingness to help with the local troubles at the near cost of your own life, hearing of your own personal struggles finding place in the world, and your assistance toward us has helped shift that considerably.”

Viepuck will admire but is not an art connisour. Largely after the apology will remain sort of quiet and distant for much of the evening unless addressed.

Odo swallows nervously. "The knowing is better than not knowing. So finding out the truth was... a relief I guess. It all feels very distant right now." He pauses. "Sleep comes easy though." He continues very earnestly. "I will be ready for tomorrow"

 > “Corrine, I wish to thank you not only for your hospitality but for an unintended transformation you have performed.  I have had some of the common Sembaran adversity to associations with wizards, though in my case from at least a more personal cause then reinforced…  Your willingness to help with the local troubles at the near cost of your own life, hearing of your own personal struggles finding place in the world, and your assistance toward us has helped shift that considerably.” 

Corrine looks up at this. "Oh, my struggles were minor." She seems cheerful when she says this. "If anything, being born in a boy's body was a gift. It never really bothered me, and it taught me at a young age that myself and my physical form are not the same thing. I know some like me who have struggled to come to themselves, but I don't even remember the wrong name my parent's first gave me. I've been Corrine as long as I can remember."

She continues. "So I appreciate your thanks, but my struggles have perhaps not been the ones you are thinking of. I love this house, but sometimes I think I should return to Tollen. Rinburg has been good to me, especially when I was younger, but my studies into transformation draw so much suspicion. Despite the stories, I would not turn anyone into a beast who didn't want me to!" - this last, almost a yell, or at least, a slightly frustrated and angry half-raised voice.

And then more quietly: "But I would dearly love to know how..."

She finishes, almost a whisper: "I had hoped to learn something down below. But it was all darkness and death..."

 %%Emilie does potentially have some stuff to add, and happy for any responses to this, but also want to give Dan a chance to jump in if he gets a little less overwhelmed at some point, so trying not to have this thread move too far along just yet%%

Celyn murmurs, “I _remember_ my old name.  But I have always been fond of birds.  It’s definitely not mine anymore, though.  Birds took it away.  I hope whoever they gave it to is happy with it.  I think there’s a balance in that.”  He gestures to the cat-and-bird and bird-and-cat images. “I’m called for a tree now, though, not a cat."
