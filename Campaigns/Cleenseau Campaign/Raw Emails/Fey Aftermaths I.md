Hi all,

  

A few quick notes from the game. As I mentioned, you found a certain number of items and goods on Areschera's body:

  

* A wand, twisted and black, like a crooked branch of a dead tree, radiating strong fey magic

* A brooch, delicate and likely valuable but not magical

* Two rings, one set with a small ruby, one with a small diamond, neither magical

* A gem of spell storing

* A red rose, sparkling slightly with fire and giving off a pleasant heat (magical)

* A pair of elegantly engraved leather bracers with complex silver engravings in Sylvan (magical)

* A small locket on a silver chain, polished to a mirror-like finish, but with no picture inside (magical)

  

In Taelgar, it is the evening of Feb 24th - and the baroness is, supposively, due back tomorrow, Feb 25th, by late afternoon. As a note, you can't long rest twice in one day, and since you spent the day asleep, you can't get back spells and such until the night after the baroness arrives.

  

So a few immediate questions:

  

**Identifying items**. Matt, you are welcome to spend spell slots to identify stuff, but that does mean slots you won't have when the baroness arrives (I have no idea if that would matter of course). I assume you used your free identify on the gem, the details of which follow.

  

**Immediate actions.** Anything you immediately want to do in town? Chris I think you mentioned wanting to tell the magistrate (Victorine Rosseau) about the detected-thoughts baroness is evil rumors...? Happy to leave that for next session as well, but to the extent we could resolve any "before the baroness arrives" stuff before next session, might be good.

  

**Plans**. Any thoughts on your next steps? Hang around for the baron and then... ? Or get out of town now? It is fair to want to await events but if you had a general idea of your planned next step (whether that's stick around town to investigate the baroness in more detail, go after the hunter, go after the hag, or head to the forest eaves and look for the centaur and/or what the baroness was poking around in, or something else) it would be useful for me to know.

From a politics point of view I suspect we cannot meaningfully bail before the baroness comes back, at least long enough to say ‘we have dealt with a threat and now there is more threat we have to deal with, nice meeting you, gotta run to deal with similar threats elsewhere’.  If we head out before then the power structure will think we’re sketchy, or at least it will be harder to maintain an upright reputation if people (baroness or otherwise) want to slander us in our absence.  
  
Chris and I were talking about the baroness situation this evening and he pointed out that we can argue to the magistrate that given we’ve got demonstrable fey incursion here we should search the keep and see if there are Dangerous Fey Artifacts there that might be causing additional problems, which is a nice cover for searching to see if we can find any necromantic bullshit in the baroness’s tower.  Which we want to do before she gets back.  
  
(The theory that the baroness is a necromancer/pawn of the big necromancer at least explains where the necromantic kipple that we know exists has been coming from.)  
  
Knowing where she was / what she was doing there would be useful so we know if that’s an emergency we need to triage above going and stabbing contestants #2 and #3….
