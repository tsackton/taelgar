One background note, that at least Viepuck would definitely know. The Royal Council being called here is a specific legal thing - specifically if the king wants to raise certain taxes (i.e. the War Tax [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/taxes-in-sembara/#war-taxes](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/taxes-in-sembara/#war-taxes)) it requires assent of his major vassals, in particular the six dukes (of Sembara, Wisford, Telham, Arnsbury, Cheimin, and Seham). Other similarly major royal initiatives (i.e. a major change to the army, declaration of a new heir, certain legal decrees, accusations of crimes against a duke, etc) would usually be presented to the royal council for their assent. Beyond that, in times of crisis, one of the things a vassal owes their lord is counsel and support.

For example -- and this is very much just an example, I don't mean to imply you have any evidence this is true -- if the King had evidence that the Duke of Sembara (Sembara is a duchy as well as the realm itself, and a very powerful one) was causing problems, it would be fairly unlikely that he would just move against the Duke, without first presenting evidence to the other dukes and getting their agreement. 

  

So although Rosalind being summoned to Embry was certainly unusual - and the summoning of other lords and ladies of her "level" is also unusual - (none of them are the liege of the king, Rosalind is a liege of the Baroness of Aveil, who is in turn a liege of the king - some of the others summoned were vassals of the various barons in Wisford, who were in turn the vassals of the Duke, who is in turn the vassal of the king) the royal council the Duke of speaking of is, if anything, late.

  

What is _supposed_ to happen is the army goes and fights the trouble while the dukes and monarch gather to plan.
