As afternoon stretched into evening, the audience with the Duke over, the party is watching a stream of people walking up the hill from Fellburn to the Oracle of Hope, sometimes called the Singing Tree or the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, the twisted beacon of hope that has sat on the hill above Fellburn for time immemorial.

The Oracle of Hope
![[oracle-of-hope.jpg|400]]


No one knows where it came from, or what it is, but sometimes, at random - sometimes, once an hour, or sometimes once in a week, it will sing, to those standing within its swirls, an indescribable song of comfort and hope. Pilgrims have always come to wait and hear it, and although layfolk sometimes call it a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, those touched by the divine know this not to be true. It is something else, older perhaps than even the gods.

The Duke's camp is near the Oracle, for symbolism, but also, the undead would not come near it, and as it is on top of a hill, it commands a wide view. Now, the stream of pilgrims is returning, and the party watches from the sides as many people walk up from Fellburn and come to the Oracle, although it is not singing today, just standing within its swirls is a blessing for many.

A young couple walks past, a curvy, confident and beautiful woman tightly holding the hand of a scruffy looking man, a few years older than her perhaps, but maybe that is just because he is unshaven.

The Oracle may not be the Wyrdling’s, but that doesn’t mean Celyn hasn’t visited it before.  It is strange and wondrous and named for hope and he appreciates that about it.  This means that he is amiably observing people milling about, drumming distractedly on whatever he’s sitting on, until he stops and goes still as the couple go by.  Then he cocks his head slightly to one side, looking, if anything, _perplexed_.  
  
“… the Players don’t usually come this way and I can’t imagine a reason she’d _leave_….”  
  
He leans back a little.  “… they were on the way to Eskbridge and Tafolwern when I left, I guess that’s….”  
  
“Huh.”  That’s in much the same tone as his more usual ‘oh okay’ but is acknowledging a mystery, rather than data.  He’s not going to approach them just now but he’s definitely tracking them *more* than he tracks the other random folk.

Viepuck is largely unconcerned with the Oracle itself and is more watching people here and there.

(Viepuck tends toward letting people externally-process and watching more often than not, but also has listened to a lot of Celyn’s ramblings-when-prompted lately, so is starting to feel that maybe Celyn needs more help and prompting to open up?). 

V: Players?  The ones you used to travel with?

Celyn glances over at Viepuck with a little nod, clearly pulled out of his ruminations.  He straightens up, shifting his attention back towards the woman and her partner, and absently holds out one hand more or less towards Robin as he works through what to say.

“Mahaut’s Miracle Players do a sort of,” he holds up his other hand briefly in a C shape before dropping it back onto his leg, “arc like that, around the Western Gulf.  Usually.  So Tafolwern to Eskbridge up to Wisford and past there, not west to here.  Eskbridge was the _wrong way_, that’s why I came this way.”  He had said he left the travelling theatre people when they ‘went the wrong way’.  “So it’d be odd if they were here.”

He gestures towards the woman.  “She joined the Players not long after I did?  Really unsure of herself. I helped her get better.  See?  She’s much happier now.”  There’s a certain pride in that; he clearly at least genuinely believes that he gets some credit for this woman’s obvious confidence.  “She made more of it than it was, though.  It got awkward, until she decided to give up on chasing me and chased Antonin instead.  That’s not him, but she’s always been generous with her attention, at least once she found herself.  But she’d gotten up to being close to leading lady when I left, I can’t imagine she’d *want* to stop with _that_.  She really likes being liked.  So her being here without the Players would also be odd.”  There, he has laid out the mystery.

He stops peering at the woman to glance at Robin, and then goes back to watching her.  His voice has gotten a little softer.  “I healed Antonin after he got stabbed.  He still remembered that I was just Celyn, same as I’d always been, after that, but Charlotte never knew how to talk with me afterwards.  That wasn’t why I left the Players.  But it does mean I’m not sure what to say to her.”

He shrugs slightly.  “I’ll see about waving to her when she comes back down, though. I want to know about the Players.  They were on the way to Tyrwingha when I left them in Wisford last summer…."

======================

Robin has a concerned look and takes Celyn's hand when he reaches out and gives a reassuring squeeze, than mostly listens quietly, unsure what to add but wanting to be supportive. When Celyn looks at him he nods a little, but is basically trying to show his support.

And ten minutes later Charlotte and her campaign come up the hill, and Charlotte sees Celyn. Her face turns pale, she looks startled, and her eyes widen, like she has seen a ghost or something, and lets out a half shout/half squeak: "Celyn!! What are you mixed up in?!?"  She turns to her companion, and explains briefly: "He's the fairy-touched one I told you about." She holds his hand a bit tighter, and half steps behind him, as they both approach Celyn. She's clearly nervous, but she is also flirting a bit, and at least Celyn can see a veneer of acting over the genuine unease, a bit of an excuse to snuggle closer to her companion.

Since Robin is holding Celyn’s hand, he can feel the little flinch; Celyn hides it reasonably competently, but not *that* competently.  
  
Still, he manages to speak more or less evenly, if not with his usual upbeat tone.  “How’ve you been, Charlotte?  How are the Players?  This is a bit off the usual route.”  If Charlotte won’t be normal at him he will be tooth-grittingly normal at her.

Robin is admittedly confused and not at all sure what exactly is going on with this dynamic, but he's staying next to Celyn and is keeping a polite demeanor while observing warily. He gives Ceyln's hand a squeeze at the flinch.

Charlotte swallows, and starts to say: "He said..." but then pauses, like she's reconsidering what she wants to say, and instead answers: "I've been well, until...." She gestures at the battlefield, encompassing but not quite speaking the whole "dead rose from ground thing".

"Mahaut and the Players are fine, well, I pray to the Wyrdling they are fine, we are wintering near Eskbridge... The rumors though... I am anxious to get back, and make sure they are fine. Hugh"  she points at her companion - "joined us recently. Antonin met someone this summer, in Eskbridge, after you left us. He keeps threatening to run off with her, and Mahaut, well, would you believe he'd leave the stage? But just in case, she says, we should have an understudy, thus Hugh. I'm training him up." She winks at Celyn with a hint of a smile at this. 

  

"We - Hugh and I -  left Caerenad [meta: a small town on the road from Eskbridge to Tafolwern about a 3 day journey south from Eskbridge] in late November. The earl there was impressed with our shows in Tafolwern and invited us to spend the quiet weeks between Vitalae and Quintarum [meta: the "leave taking holiday", the other half of Viatale. I might change the name, and coming up on Jan 22, so just a few days from now] at his estate. Mahaut jumped at the chance. Hugh here is a Sembaran boy, like me, and had some family debts to settle in Orbas [meta: a small village near Fellburn, deserted now, you passed it on your way along the road], and Josse is finally writing that play about the Oracle of Hope he has been talking about for years. Well, one thing led to another and as I've never seen the Oracle, Hugh had family business, and a few weeks on the road together seemed nice, after Antonin... We are due to rejoin Mahaut in Eskbridge in a week... I hope all is well."

  

She pauses again, and beckons Celyn closer, like she wants to speak more privately.

Which gets Celyn nodding, because that is indeed a lot, even if he’s sort of inured to it now.

Celyn manages a chuckle and a nod there.

“I’m glad to know the Players are okay.  From what I’ve heard the troubles have mostly not reached Tyrwingha though of course I worry.”  Celyn levers himself back up to his feet - his exhaustion is still there even if he’s recovered somewhat by this point - and gives Robin’s hand another squeeze before letting go and approaching the woman to hear what she wants to say.

Charlotte begins: “He said to tell you..” and here her acting skill is evident, she makes her voice a bit deeper and repeats a line, clearly from memory: “A little bird’s wings can’t reach from sunrise to sunset, nor even from the late afternoon shadow to the sunset gate.

But, I haven’t said who he is. It all started a few months ago. The earl keeps a manor on a hill above Caerenad, a lovely place, there is a little wooded trail that follows a stream down the hill and a little pool where the moon sometimes reflects off the water. A good place to be alone, or alone with someone. Um. Anyway, Antonin was with his lady, and Hugh had played the leading and we were full of energy, you know how it is after a performance where everything clicks… and we went down the hill, and at the pool, there was a man, whistling a lovely tune. A halfling I thought at first, but at second glance I saw he was just very short. I think I was a bit rude, I was surprised to see him, so I blurted out - “Who are you?”  
  
And he replied - “the past, the present, and the future, and who are you, young lady?”  
  
I thought his answer quite odd, but I replied: “Charlotte, actor, of Mahaut’s Miracle Players. And this is Hugh, recently joined of the same company, and a fine actor as well, and beautiful in the moonlight!”  
  
He seemed amused at this, and whistled a jaunty little tune, and held out his hand to me and said: “May I tell your fortune? I am practicing you see. I only ask you deliver a message to one of Mahaut’s Players for me. May I do this, Charlotte the actor, beautiful in the moonlight?”  
  
I said yes, and he reached out his hand, and looked at my palm for some time, tracing lines, muttering in a language I didn’t know. His face looked grave a moment, like a cloud over the sun, but then it was gone and he said:  
  
“Ah, a long life and happiness!” Which I thought was a bit simple after he spent five minutes looking at my palm. But then he added, “And I have a message for the little bird, when you see him again.” I was confused, said I didn’t know any little birds, to which he said, “Of course, only a few call him that. The holly tree, I mean.”  
  
When I stared blankly he looked at me annoyed and said: “Celyn, you dolt!”  Which I didn’t think was very fair and when I tried to explain you were not with the players anymore, he said: “Never you mind. Repeat this when you see him” and he told me the thing about birds and eagles, and handed me scrap of paper with Ruby’s name on it, and whistling a tune, turned his back on us and left. I could never find him again, although to be honest I didn’t dare look.  
  
I took the paper back to Ruby, but she said there was nothing written there. When I told her this story she slapped me and called me an idiot and told me it wasn’t safe for me to talk to fairies alone and that I shouldn’t be left to wander accompanied only by fools in the Tyrwinghan countryside.  But I don’t think anything too bad happened, although I assumed I’d never see you again.  I thought about writing a letter but I had no idea where to address it.  
  
But then three days later the earl’s wife gave Mahaut a jewel, in thanks for a particularly fine performance, and we all got some money.

And now I’m standing here on the road telling you this message, just like the strange man told me. I’m scared Celyn, what am I mixed up in?

Celyn’s expression when he says this shifts to one of incredulous, faintly horrified and exhausted exasperation that he cannot control, because he knows a fey when he hears about one and why do Sembarans have _no sense about fairies_ dear gods.  He is too tired from the entire course of the day to hide it, though he tries to soften it with, “I’ve done stupider things talking to fairies,” and a vague wave of his hand.

> He seemed amused at this, and whistled a jaunty little tune, and held out his hand to me and said: “May I tell your fortune? I am practicing you see. I only ask you deliver a message to one of Mahaut’s Players for me. May I do this, Charlotte the actor, beautiful in the moonlight?”

There’s a streak of some protectiveness in Celyn about this woman, despite the fact that she is clearly also very complicated for him, and he says something he believes will clarify things for her somewhat:  “The name I was called when I was a child was an old word for a kind of finch.  So the fey often call me ‘little bird’, even though I’m not a finch anymore. I think they might think it’s funnier now that I’m _not_, actually."

Celyn says, a little distracted, “I’m sorry the Oracle doesn’t seem to be in a singing mood today, it’s… remarkable when it does,” as he tries to figure out how on earth to explain *anything*.

He wants to reassure her, now.  “From what he told you, I think all you need to worry about being mixed up in is bringing me that message, which you did.  I’m not sure what it means, yet, but I am glad that he thought to tell me, and glad that fortune brought you to where you could deliver it.  He divined a happy life for you, and you should have that.  And you’re headed back to Tyrwingha, right?  I believe it is safer in Tyrwingha, right now.”  He certainly hopes so, at least.

“As to what I’m mixed up in….”  Celyn turns back to gesture at Robin and Viepuck.  “We helped the Duke break the siege here, a little bit.  There have been troubles on the road, but it’s clear to Cleenseau for now.  I’ve been…”  Words are hard, and he stares at the sky a moment.  “We’ve been trying to figure out what’s causing all these things, and keep people as safe as we can.”

There are all kinds of things he doesn’t even know how to start saying here, visibly so, so instead he works on wrapping up the conversation.  “You stay safe and get back to the Players safe, okay?  Tell Mahaut she was right that the armour was a good parting gift, and Alys and Adri that I have been doing my best to not look like a blood-drenched madman, okay?”  As shared jokes it is perhaps not the most reassuring one but he is so tired, too tired to come up with something better.  “And tell Mahaut it’s safer that side of the river right now.  And… if anyone needs to reach me, post to Cleenseau Manor will find me eventually.”

He takes a breath and turns to address Hugh, saying, “You do right by her, all right? She’s done so much to get to where she is.  Luck go with you, with the Players."

> “As to what I’m mixed up in….”  Celyn turns back to gesture at Robin and Viepuck.  “We helped the Duke break the siege here, a little bit.  There have been troubles on the road, but it’s clear to Cleenseau for now.  I’ve been…”  Words are hard, and he stares at the sky a moment.  “We’ve been trying to figure out what’s causing all these things, and keep people as safe as we can.” 

 > There are all kinds of things he doesn’t even know how to start saying here, visibly so, so instead he works on wrapping up the conversation.  “You stay safe and get back to the Players safe, okay?  Tell Mahaut she was right that the armour was a good parting gift, and Alys and Adri that I have been doing my best to not look like a blood-drenched madman, okay?”  As shared jokes it is perhaps not the most reassuring one but he is so tired, too tired to come up with something better.  “And tell Mahaut it’s safer that side of the river right now.  And… if anyone needs to reach me, post to Cleenseau Manor will find me eventually.”

Charlotte gulps a bit at this, and nods, listening hard, like she is taking instructions from a mentor. "We are heading east just as soon as we can, tomorrow, I think. I hear some of the Duke's men are riding toward Eskbridge, and offering anyone going that way their company." She looks at Hugh. "We mean to take the offer, and stay safe. And I will tell Mahaut what you said, and Alys and Adri, and everyone. Maybe this summer we will stay in Tyrwingha, as you say."

  

She pauses: "You've grown..." She trails off, uncertain how to finish the sentence. And then ends more quietly: "I'm sorry, about before. The world needs your kind of unnerving. To prevent.." she gestures again towards the battlefield.  ".. other kinds." And even more softly: "Don't die, please?"

 > He takes a breath and turns to address Hugh, saying, “You do right by her, all right? She’s done so much to get to where she is.  Luck go with you, with the Players."

Hugh has been silent this whole time, listening, not inattentive or distracted, but clearly he knew the story and knew it was Charlotte's to tell. "I'll do my best. She's special, for sure. I'll stick with her as long as she'll have me." He adds: "And I understand you helped her. Thanks for that. And we will take all the luck and blessings you can give us, with gratitude." He looks at all three of you - Robin, Celyn, Viepuck: "Go be heroes, for all us simple folk now. And if you've ever a need for an acting troupe, my family will be settled back in Orbas soon, just ask around for the Cossons. I send letters home regular, they should know where we are, approximately at least."

Celyn nods, and takes her hand in both of his, and gives it a gentle squeeze.  “I’ve seen things you don’t want to have to think about, and it’s okay, I see them so you don’t have to think about them.  Maybe someday I’ll give Josse some fodder for more tales over a bottle of wine.  Let’s hope for that, shall we?”

He pauses, letting go, and says, “I don’t intend to,” with that same quietness, but as he steps back he makes that dice-throwing gesture again.  He does not know.

To Hugh he says, “She needed my help when she was still in pinfeathers, but the flying she does is all her own.”  He draws in a breath and holds out his hands, saying “Fortune favor your travels, both of you.  May the Wyrdling shelter you and return you to your stage,” before taking the few steps back to Robin’s side.

Later, when the actors are gone, Viepuck will inquire on this: 

“It…. Has moods?  Or is that just metaphor?  Having moods would make it quite a bit more interesting”…. 

(I fully expect that I will spend all the Mind-Probes on interesting people (Lenora, the Duke, I think Elise maybe) but then tomorrow morning will try probing the Oracle, just to see what happens…)

Celyn shrugs slightly.  “Sometimes it sings a lot, sometimes it doesn’t.  I don’t know if it’s a … person, a being, but ‘moods’ is as good an explanation as any?"
