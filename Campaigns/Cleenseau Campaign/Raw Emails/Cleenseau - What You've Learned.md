Hi all,  

  

I'm going to assume that you went and talked to Wymar, and this email outlines a couple of things: (a) some general background, (b) what you learned recently from Jonathon Henwyn (the steward), (c) Wymar Essford (the old lord), (d) Harold Stonebridge (the halfling child), (e) Béatrix (the woman who just miscarried a zombie baby)

  

My assumption is that our next session will start at about 12pm, in Essford manor, immediately after having finished talking to Wymar. Viepuck has to lead the conversation with Wymar. Everyone else can choose to either take a short rest, accompany Viepuck, or do something else. If you want to do something else, let me know.

  

**Background**

Some general background on hobgoblins, recent history, and Cleenseau might be useful. This is all stuff that everyone would know or would have learned in the 3+ months you've been in town.

The current date is early January, 1720.

-  Hobgoblins, unlike orcs, are not crazy bloodlust-driven monsters. They are basically soulless fascists. When they have occasionally conquered places, they tend to prevent anyone from leaving, confiscate a good portion of the product of human labor (but leave just enough for humans to survive, if not comfortably), and order folks around They have no compunctions about killing, but they are basically rationale and don't engage in the type of wanton murder and cruelty that you saw from the orcs.
- The Great War was a huge, world-wide conflict against a dragon, Cha'mutte, who commanded legions of hobgoblins. It ended in DR 1545 (175 years ago). The ~100 years after the Great War were a difficult time and involved several hobgoblin wars and other disasters
- Queen Cece I came to the throne in 1648 in the middle of the Third Hobgoblin War, which Sembara was losing. She -- supposedly because of the blessing of the Father -- turned the tide of the war and ushered in a golden age. Her son Robert I is the current king
- During the 3rd Hobgoblin War (75 years ago), Cleenseau was sacked by hobgoblins and most of the population put to death. 
- Reginald Essford (Rosalind's grandfather, Wymar's father) was an army captain in the 3rd Hobgoblin War and was raised to the Lord of Cleenseau by Cece for his heroics
- The great bridge in Cleenseau is very ancient, older than Sembara. Some people think it was built by the dwarves, or maybe giants. But not everyone even believes giants are real.
- Cleenseau is on the north bank on the Enst. On the south bank is a pretty run down ruined fort. It's old but no one really knows when it was from. Probably the Great War.
- Essford Manor is two stories with a main basement and some root cellars beneath the main basement. There are several outbuildings, mostly single story with attics and storage cellars.

**Jonathon Henwyn's Stories**

Jonathon is the steward of Essford Manor and responsible for its bookkeeping and upkeep, as well as collecting the rents from farmers and other manorial administration. He shares the following stories and information. He doesn't know much about the older history of the town, but shares the following information about the Essford period.

- The hobgoblins occupied Cleenseau during the 3rd Hobgoblin War and built a motte and bailey castle / fortification here, but it was destroyed except for the actual hill of the motte by Cece's troops but a lot of rubble was left behind 
- Cleenseau was an army camp for a couple of years in the 1649 - 1651 period while Cece was still fighting the hobgoblins to the south.
- There are probably some records or information about this war hidden away in the garrison
- Essford Manor was built by Reginald shortly after he became lord in the early 1650s on top of the hobgoblin-built motte  
    
- Underhill (the poor neighborhood where Tumbledown Manor is) was mostly built on top of the ruins of the hobgoblin fort in the 1660s and 1670s as the town grew. 

**Wymar's Stories**

You find Rinault and go talk to Wymar, specifically curious about the history of Essford Manor. Before even getting to talk to Wymar,  Rinault shares a few stories:

- When Renault was a bored teenager he sometimes took some buddies and went to smash stuff in the old ruins on the south side of the Enst. One night, he says, he swore he saw a skeleton arm move in the dirt. 
- He was fiercely forbidden from climbing around the hill or the basements of Essford Manor. He was always a rambunctious kid and often didn't follow the rules, but the one time he and two friends were "digging for buried treasure" in the side of the hill his father was apoplectic and he was confined to his room for a month afterwards. 

Wymar is harder to rouse now then before, he seems even more lost in his dementia. It is hard to direct the conversation or get answers to questions, and Wymar doesn't really seem to have a lot of memories of the keep and certainly not any secrets that his father passed along. But you do manage to gather one remembrance that seems relevant:  

- Wymar recounts a memory of when he was a boy, overhearing his parents (Reginald and Celine). Reginald was very drunk, and was weeping. Wymar recalls hearing his father sobbing to Celine Essford: "I can't forget it. That day, the bodies just kept walking up out of the tower, just below us, and he was grinning even as we struck him down. Mother help me, I want to forget. Sometimes in my dreams I still see it. Was it wrong to build here? Is this place cursed?".

(  Just to be clear, Reginald was a captain in the 3rd hobgoblin wars and got around. Not saying your inference is wrong, but also don’t immediately assume he was talking about this tower.)

**Harold Stonebridge**  

Harold is the young halfling who Celyn befriended, and who showed you the secret passage beneath the Crossroads Inn. He tells you a couple of interesting things:

- He says that his great-grand aunt Marigold says that the Crossroads Inn is hundreds of years old, and is the oldest building in Cleenseau. She was alive, he says, when the hobgoblins were here 75 years ago.
- He says is brothers used to tell him scary stories about this secret passageway, but he never believed them and he wouldn't repeat them to Celyn if asked. Tracking down the brothers would be easy though

**Béatrix**   

In the aftermath of her miscarriage, Béatrix is upset, but she tells you two things that might be relevant. 

  ![[email_image_01.png]]

In the map above, the blue circle is around Margaret Ashford (the midwife's) house. The red X is where you fought the zombies. The 2 is her house. 1 is Tumbledown Farm.

  

Her story is that:

* On January 3rd, her neighbor (Jon) his wife (Susanne) and their 3 grown kids (Samuel, Ella, and Betsy) (who lives at 3) were all ill. She brought him and his family soup.

* January 4th they seemed to be better but Beatrix was ill

* January 5th, she was feeling better and went out with Robin 

* January 6th, she had a miscarriage and zombie stuff

(  Beatrix checked on them on the 4th (2 days ago) and they seemed fine.)
