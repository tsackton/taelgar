Meta notes

(1) I'm keeping this off the list for now in case anyone wants to preserve the ability to report this in game to Matt; I can forward him the whole thing and/or move it onto the list if no one wants to roleplay the report back to Izgil

  

(2) I've gone back a little bit in time and mostly redescribed the ending scene of last session, to clarify/remind everyone what is going on]

  

After emerging from the lake and accepting the hospitality of the grandee's of Rinburg in thanks for the defeat of the rotting eel (and perhaps, an end to the famous Rinburg eel casseroles, although time will tell), the party rides east, chasing rumors of battle and war. 

  

January 18th is a sunny day, unseasonably warm, and the countryside flashes by, as the horses eat up the miles of the Great South Road. A restless and uneasy night is spent in Cienne, one of the last market towns that is still populated, about 20 miles from Fellburn. The town is full of rumors of battle - an inconclusive affair was fought two days ago, and the Duke is apparently waiting for something. As the morning of January 19th, dawns, Es*talios reports a battle is imminent, and the party races ahead, pushing their horses to try to reach Fellburn in time to help.

  

Fellburn itself is set on the banks of the Enst, where the land is flat along the north bank. There is a wide bend in the river, and the city sits in this bend. The south bank of the river here is quite hilly and rocky. The north bank is dominated by three hills: the Gottarbain, to the northwest, the Fellbain, where the Oracle of Hope sits, to the north east, and the Enstbain, along the banks of the Enst, to the east.
  
![[fellburn-rough-map.png]]
  

As you ride towards the city from the west, the sun reaching towards noon, you can see the plains in front of you, between the city walls and the three hills, covered by an army of skeletons. Amongst the skeletons you can see trampled and destroyed croplands, and several small abandoned villages, but the walls of Fellburn seem unbreached and defended. The battle is well joined, and has clearly been going on for some time.

  

On the Fellbain, you see an encampment, with fluttering banners, and tents perched amongst the Oracle itself, and tiny figures standing and watching the battle - presumably this is the Duke's command post.

  

In front of the Enstbain, spreading north, is a large and well established force of archers and pikemen, holding the hill itself and the ground just to the west of it. The Duke's banner is prominent here, as is the crown of stars of the Night Queen, and sparkling in the air above them are seven motes of light, which dance and flare whenever undead come within about 100 feet. The undead, when this happens, fall to dust, invariably. From behind the pikemen, you see barrel after barrel of flaming oil, and volley after volley firing from the archers of flaming arrows. 

  

Riding south, from between the hills, a dozen groups of fast moving calvary ride, driving the skeletons, as much as possible, towards the east and the trap of the Enstbain. On the Gottarbain, holding the high ground, you can see reinforcements and reserves, mostly with swords, maces, and hammers.

  

And riding above it all, a paladin in pure white metal plate mail, riding a black and silver pegasus, riding down wherever there is trouble, or groups of skeletons flinging bones, she descends upon them like a vengeful spirit and destroys them, sometimes by merely flinging up her hand, but mostly with her sword, which seems to carry some blessing of the night and moves almost too quickly to follow. 

  

As you ride nearer, you can see the battle is going well for the Duke - the skeletons are mostly being herded as needed, and although a few are slipping into the river, mostly upstream (west) of Fellburn, the calvary forces are doing a good job keeping the edge of the battlefield clear.

  

One calvary group in particular is riding along the western edge of the battle, and would be easy to reach or join with, alternatively, if you made your way through the battlefield - doable, certainly, and in an hour, probably not even necessarily dangerous - you could reach either the Duke's encampment or the main force of archers. The reserves on the Gottarbain are also quite near to you, and seem to be primarily watching, although as you ride closer, you start to see movement and flags waving from the command post, as if the reserves are perhaps being given some order.

  

Finally of course, there is a paladin above you, as well as scattered skeletons fleeing the wrong way or slipping into the river. Your group is smaller than the 20-person calvary parties, but you have your own power, and could simply try to form your own raid/contain/harass unit.

  

Feel free to discuss in or out of character a bit on what you're doing, and let me know, at which point I'll narrate most of the rest of the battle and then transition to opportunities to roleplay/info-gather with the various people around. Of course the options above are not the only things you can do, I can answer questions about the scene if needed.

  

[Meta - if you are doing something "battle like" - i.e. forming a harassment unit or joining the calvary a random element would be good - roll a d8 and let me know what you got, plus give me some idea of the main tactics you are using]

From Chris:

Quick commentary - they mostly have it under control, I think our best use would be for river skeletons cleanup so that they don’t escape and invade the surrounding countryside, we’ve had to deal with a lot of that and it would be best to spare the local farmers more trouble if possible.  6 on d8 should that be relevant for this action, but only taking this action if other people agree, Viepuck is not riding away from the group. 

  

Meeting up with other soldier groups can be done after, they seem to not particularly NEED us, except as possibly border skirmishers.  

  

I am not up for summarizing for Izgul in-character.  I vote main-list.

From Mike:

The party rides down the hill and the battle is joined. Mostly, the party takes a defensive position between the low foothills rising to Gotterbain and the walls of Fellburn, making sure no skeletons escape to the Enst. The skeletons come in clumps and trickles, one or two, then perhaps a dozen, then a long spell with none, then another burst. For the most part, the fighting is not hard, and Viepuck's eldritch magic shatters skeleton after skeleton. Once, a larger clump surrounding a bone thrower appears, but Armaund throws up the Night Queen's symbol and scatters the infantry, leaving the bone thrower vulnerable to Robin's charge. Another time, twenty skeletons make a break from the west, stumbling down the hill behind the party, and there is a bit of scramble as Celyn, Robin, and Emile close ranks to hold off the skeletons while Odo, Armaund, and Viepck attack from the rear. Celyn's rapier flicks again and again at the weak spots of the skeletons, and Robin smashes a particularly large one with the might of the Wanderer. Emile takes a bad wound, but is healed in the quiet afterwards, and so the next hour passes.

  

Once the black and silver pegasus flies low over the party, and the woman in white armor raises a hand in greeting before flying onward to continue the fight. The walls of Fellburn are nearby, and occasionally a defender appears, but they seem ill-equipped and do not participate much. Once, a man in a fine red cloak appears on the wall and watches the party through a spyglass for a few minutes. Later, a twin brother and sister appear on the wall, both wearing chain mail and fine fur cloaks, but carrying no (apparent) weapons, and watch the party for some time, before moving onward along the wall to watch other parts of the battle.

  

As morning turns to afternoon, the reserves, positioned on the top of the Gotterbain, ride down from the hill, sweeping past the party in well organized ranks, before turning north to complete the mop up of the remaining skeletons on the battlefield north of the city. No further skeletons leak through to the river, and the sounds of battle fade. 

  

As the battle ends, the party looks around. To the north is the main battlefield, covered in bones, and some - but blessed few - dying or dead soldiers. In the center of this battlefield, the reserve troops have established a camp of sorts, and most of the scattered calvary are heading there, to dismount, and care for their horses, and recover from the battle. You can also see, riding from the hills to the east, a group of about a dozen men and women on horseback, riding toward the camp, bearing signs of the Night Queen. 

  

To the west, the road back towards Rinburg is empty, and to the south, the river rushes by unconcerned with mortal affairs. 

  

To the east, is the city of Fellburn itself, and the walls are growing more crowded, as a mood of celebration starts to take hold. You can see the brother of the twins you saw earlier, standing on the wall watching you and beckoning in welcome. Beyond Fellburn, you can't see what else is happening in the east, although on the hill of the Oracle, the Duke's encampment has not changed much, yet. You recall that a strong force of archers and magic that destroyed undead was on the east side of Fellburn.

  

Finally, in the sky above the black and silver pegasus with its holy rider circles, watching. She flies low over the party again, curiously.

  

What do you do?

  

(meta: I'm not sure how well I've conveyed it, but some obvious things you could do is go towards the city or the camp or the Duke's encampment or the paladin or the archers - its basically a question of who do you try to talk to first, or you could also split up if you want, multiple conversations are easy enough to do in email)

Celyn’s first impulse is to check in with Robin to see if they can go see if any of the wounded can be saved, because this does not sound like the sort of fighting that has cost us much in levelled spells and thus we are loaded up on miracle power actually.  If that seems to be covered by the Night Queen’s forces, though, and we would be superfluous, he is reasonably amiable about anything (and perhaps slightly suspecting that Viepuck may want to talk to the paladin).


From Chris:

Probably first wave at the woman on the pegasus, though more in greeting and less in “come over here”.  I’m sure she has things to do first.   
  
Take 24 goodberries for the healing fund.  (If I can spend 3 spell slots and leave a 2nd-lvl in reserve. Otherwise 16, would like to have one slot anyway). They don’t heal much but can stabilize someone.   
Viepuck will largely follow Robin’s starting lead.  It may be sensible to deploy spreading out over the battlefield surveying, as more eyes will spot more that can be saved.   
  
I can write a quick letter of introduction (or several in sequence) and send Es’Tiasilos to deliver them, though dog-with-letter probably a little easier to parse than flying-octopus-abomonation.   
  
Mike - if I cast a Simple Image over Es’Tiasolos, can that move about with if that is the only spell I’m concentrating on?  Would it need to be in visual range and keep my attention, or just Concentration?

From Mike:

Quick notes-  
  
On healing: Robin used a couple of leveled spells to smite but otherwise you have all your spells. You don’t really know how much healing the army has but you’d guess there are more injuries than healing and faster is better, ie a badly wounded person will do better getting some healing the hour they are wounded than a day or two later.  
  
On silent image: you can move the image using your action, but you have to be within 60’. Once you are 60’ away it’s static. So you can disguise estaliaos only if you stay within 60’  
  
Mike

From Tim:

FWIW, with the battle over, Armand's first priority is helping with healing as much as he can. He'll stick with the group assuming others are doing the same, or spread out to cover more ground, depending on whatever the rest of the party proposes. 

  

If he recognizes the paladin on the pegasus, he is happy to introduce the party to her. 

  

Otherwise, once the general chaos of battle and the immediate post-battle aftermath settles, his main goal is to head to the Oracle of Hope and check in; he guesses that this is where any clerics of the Night Queen helping with the battle would be found. He is also happy to facilitate introductions to anyone he knows at the main Oracle of Hope camp.  

  

Also, Armand is planning on remaining in Fellburn for some time. Unless the party is intending to depart before evening, he'll make plans to join them for dinner, assuming that is amenable to everyone. He figures he is not likely to see this group again soon and would like some time for a proper goodbye.

From Chris:

Ok.  Did someone want Viepuck to run off to provide a herald-introduction anywhere?  Possibly run to the city, talk to people there and tell them that you will be checking on the camp first and then stopping by later?  Then I can meet you at the camp?  
  
Add a pile of 20+ goodberries to the healing cause, more for stabilization to get later attention than anything else.  
Es’Tiasilos can stay with you and relay messages to me if needed.   
  
Viepuck REALLY wants to meet the paladin, but also recognizes that this is an important political-connection-moment and that to some extent it may be important to be in multiple places at once so no one feels slighted later.  (I don’t think anyone will, but we don’t know who we’re dealing with yet).

You can also see, riding from the hills to the east, a group of about a dozen men and women on horseback, riding toward the camp, bearing signs of the Night Queen. 

Armand, Robin, Odo, Emile, and Celyn ride north, along the walls of Fellburn, towards this makeshift camp. You arrive at a scene of controlled chaos. The battle was won, yes, but the sounds of dying humans and horses fill the air, and the camp is awash with noise and soldiers. It seems the battle has not been entirely without injury. After brief greetings, the offer of healing assistance is gratefully accepted, and Robin, Armand, and Celyn find themselves working alongside young-seeming halfling, who introduces himself as Anton Whitehill - clearly a medic or healing of some sort, although he does not immediately appear to have magic - and quickly directs the spellcasters to help the worst of the wounded. The goodberries as much appreciated, and Anton puts them to good use. Two hours pass, as the party criss-crosses the battlefield, helps with triage and healing, and generally keeps busy with tending to the aftermath of battle, and the sun sinks lower on the horizon. Joining the party in this task are many soldiers of course, as well as a group of ten acolytes and disciples of the Night Queen, lead by an ageless man, thin but strong looking, in a fine black tunic, now slightly dusty and torn, embroidered with three stars on each of the shoulders. He is always somehow the center of the healing, and he prays again and again over the worst injured.  As his prayer continues over the next many minutes, three times motes of light fly from his hands, spreading healing. He seems spent though, and you sense the better part of his power has been exhausted in the battle.  

  

And so, in time, the party is introduced to Raoul Boulain, elder of the Night Queen. Armand knows of him, of course, but has never met him personally. He notices carefully the party, and their healing magic, and speaks a few words of gratitude and blessing to the party. His blessing seems to carry a density with it, a feeling of compassion and the peacefulness of a wholesome night's rest. After brief introductions, he says, "I see you, Celyn of the Wyrdling, growing by a twisty path to your destiny. I see you, Robin of the Wanderer, your heart singing with charity. I perceive you have been fighting with us for some weeks." He gestures towards the Duke's camp. "I am sure your story will fall on eager ears, there."  To Armand, he says: "Your calling shines in you. I thank you for your service." To Odo, he says: "Your pain will heal. Your valor is seen." He touches him briefly. "May your sleep be untroubled by nightmares, with my Queen's blessing and thanks."  To Emile, he murmurs, "Fear not. It will be well."

  

As Raoul finishes his blessings, one of his followers steps forward, and embraces Armand. (Clearly, they know each other). "Armand, fate brings us together. Come, we must speak, I would know of your journeys these past weeks...."

  

And so Armand is pulled away, with introductions and promises to meet for again before leaving, perhaps in the Duke's camp later. The encampment is growing, as the archers from the east start marching this way, and people from Fellburn reach the camp - but there is also a sense of activity. You learn this is a somewhat makeshift army, several regiments of the Army of the South at its core, but supplemented by many levies and loans from the lords of Wisford. The battle at Gowerbourne was difficult, for the Night Queen's magic was not so strong, the Elder Boulain had not joined the camp. You hear stories from the wounded, of the walking dead at Gowerbourne, sliced again and again with swords, only to get up and keep fighting, again and again. A nightmare, it seems, and many soldiers died there. Half the people you talk to are young, new recruits, and half veterans, recently rejoined, to supplement the troops. The Duke is beloved, but there is some muttering about King Robert, and much lamenting that the old Queen, Cece of blessed memory, was not still ruler. 

The Duke's camp is a bustling, well organized place near the Oracle of Hope, although the Duke is already packing to leave. It seems he plans to take an early supper and ride for Embry with a vanguard of his troops and most of his advisors and courtiers. There is much activity, and it is hard to be properly introduced, or have a sensible conversation. You talk for some time with Marcel Desrosiers, the captain of the Duke's guard, who spares half an hour to get your story and answer your questions. You learn that King Robert has summoned the dukes to Embry, for a conclave, to discuss what is to be done, and he fears he will arrive late.

  

You get the sense that this is not an optional summons, and being late could have consequences. The Duke’s household certainly seems eager to be on the road. But they seem to be waiting for something, beyond just supper and a meal, and recovery from the battle. 

  

In the meantime, feel free to jump in with any questions or things you want to do in camp. The paladin is around (although busy), if you want to talk to her.  I’ll continue with the Duke’s departure, and one scene on the Oracle of Hope shortly regardless of responses here (we can run a bit in parallel).

  

Finally there is the ride back to Cleenseau- if there is anything in particular you want to do let me know.

Celyn accepts the blessing with a slightly awkward little bow and a murmured, “Fate does seem to have caught up with me,” that is a little wry and amused.  He glances at Robin when he receives his own blessing, smiling gently, and nods a little at Odo’s, seemingly grateful that someone has said something potentially sensible there.

Celyn wishes to give the Duke a blessing, which he works on phrasing with a sort of ferocious intensity and eventually settles on, “May fortune favor and speed your travels, may luck keep you safe, and may hope bring you and your people back home” should he be permitted to deliver it.

Celyn wants to know if the roads are clear past Fellburn, particularly in the direction of Eskbridge.  It is possible that it will become clear that he wants to find someone going that way (probably in Fellburn itself) to send a letter with before the party returns to Cleenseau, and is thinking in terms of ‘find a merchant going to Tyrwingha and add it to their cargo’, because it genuinely doesn’t occur to him to hire a courier, that is how he’s always sent letters home.  (But it’s no good unless the roads are safe enough.)  
  
(I will send you the letter contents later, Mike, when I am awake enough to write the damn thing.)


From Dan:

I guess what I want to ask...if someone can think of a diplomatic way to do so...is if the Duke is leaving, what is everyone else supposed to do? Who's in charge if most of his advisors are going with him? Is there going to someone here capable and respected enough to rally more forces if another skeleton hoard (or worse) shows up? The regional nobility keeps getting summoned to Embry for these councils or whatever, and I get it, but it also seems like everything's falling apart while everyone with any authority has either gone to the capital or are dithering about trying to figure out what to do about random conflicting orders.

Celyn is pretty sure that there is something *extremely sketchy* going on with these orders calling various nobles and the army and what have you back and forth, and has no idea what to do about it other than call the attention of the Wyrdling, who protects those who are _taking risks_, to the Duke and his people.  Which is why he got intense about wanting to give that crew his blessing.
