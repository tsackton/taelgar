Here are the loose ends I recall from the session.

Stench Monster
The stench monster of Eftly was not hunted down. Odo is from Eftly, and may have information, assistance, etc if you go after it. Eftly is 40 miles, which is basically what you can cover in a day. So it would be a 2-3 day trip, probably. Less if you have some magic or other means to push your mounts beyond normal.

(And Greymalkin is a little faster than a normal horse, but you'd need to keep to the pace of the rest of the party)

Investigate Sarabeth and Lucas Asa
The previous lord of Asieneau, who disappeared mysteriously 4 years ago, and his mother, who disappeared in 1667

Investigate the Bogbight Report
The Bogbight report tells of a number of dangers that appeared to be fey-related and occurred in 1667/1668 (~50 years ago)

It mentions a number of names:
*  Philip Mutha of Beury (the current lord's father)
* Marcel de Valarin, from Valarin in Maseau (dead, the founder of the Order of the Charitable Wanderer)
* Adèle Laurent, in Rinburg (unclear status, part of the Rangers)
* Oswald Greensborn in the Barony of Vaubonne (unclear status, Vaubonne is one of the small baronies south of the Enst from Fellburn)
* Vahaiya, the report author (likely still alive, as they are an elf)

Note also that anyone in Cleenseau who was alive during this period might have more information to share. Walter, the retired janitor, definitely was, as was Marigold. Others might have been if you ask around. You basically need to find people who are 70+ years old.

Just throwing these out as notes. Feel free to reply with anything you want to remember as a loose end.
