[meta: switching to the main list for the rest of this. Matt, the rough background here is that the party has witnessed the end of the siege of Fellburn, and are now visiting with the Duke of Wisford, who was instrumental in breaking the siege, in his camp, before departing, presumably to return to Cleenseau. This email is the plot/info dump email, mostly outlining the people you meet and what you learn. I'm going to send two other emails, for more roleplaying background purposes - a scene by the Oracle of Hope, and an audience with the Duke]

  

The Duke's camp is a busy place, and in the course of the evening, much information is exchanged. In particular, you speak for some time with Marcel Desrosiers, the captain of the Duke's household guard, who is currently serving as something of a liaison with various soldiers, army regimental commanders, and so on, and Yolande Leclair, a disciple of the Night Queen, and servant of Raoul. Raoul himself seems to have disappeared, although Yolande will only say that she trusts he is where the Night Queen needs him to be. Armand seems unphased by his disappearance, and adds that Raoul was very interested in the body of the zombie eel, currently at the Night Queen's temple in Rinburg. 

  

From Marcel, you learn the basic lay of the land:   

  

He has little news of the west (Dunfry, and the Western Wall, and other western baronies), but he knows of five major undead attacks (not including Cleenseau, which he has just learned of, from you):

  

The places are all on the map here, if you need context: [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/sembara/)

  

* skeletons in Fellburn, just now defeated, and apparently the largest group anywhere

* skeletons and zombies just north of Eskbridge, defeated about a week ago by mixed force of Sembarans and Tyrwinghans led by a warlock of Ethlenn, Rhiannon Greencloak

* skeletons south of Gowerbourne, defeated about a week ago as well, by the Duke's ragtag force

* zombies in the Aveil Hills, still roaming as far as Marcel knows, although the best intelligence the Duke's group has is that this is comparatively very small (on the order of a hundred zombies, similar to say the force that attacked Cleenseau)

* zombies in the hills north of the city of Ainwick, which is also besieged. Information is scattered here, and Marcel is not clear on what is true and what is a rumor, but he thinks the Army of the West has gone to Ainwick

  

As far as he knows, there have been no other reports, especially not from the areas north and east of Embry. His news from the south and west, as I said above, is sketchy at best. 

  

The random zombies and skeletons across the land seemed to have been focused in the broad band of Wisford and the baronies to the west, in the region between the Wistel and the Enst. He has had no reports of new awakenings in the last ten days, although there are still scattered reports of undefeated undead in small handfuls in places that suffered badly, like Eftly. 

  

Marcel has some concerns about how heavily they have stripped the guards of small villages and towns to build this army quickly. He explains that the army camped outside Fellburn is, at its core, several companies of the Army of the South, along with some of the Duke's personal guard, the town guard of Wisford, and parts of about five dozen lord's guards from various small villages and towns across Wisford. One of the Duke's major goals from the royal council is to get reinforcements.

  

He also does report, however, that as best he knows (when combined with your reports), the roads are clear from Cleenseau to Eskbridge, Fellburn to Embry, and from Wisford to the borders of the Duchy, at least. And farther north, to Chemin, Arnsbury, and Telham, as well. The west is uncertain though, as are the borderlands south of the Enst. 

  

He believes Tyrwingha has been unaffected, as far as he knows, although there are strange rumors - the Army of Mostreve (Tyrwinghan's army) is said to be patrolling the borders of the Enst, as if danger might be coming from Sembara, and the Oracle of the Riven has been in hiding it is said, or gone to the Feywild, or into the Mostreve Hills seeking something.

  

From Yolande, you learn some more about the Night Queen's involvement. She tells you briefly of the premonitions she, and many others felt, of something terrible rising, of the darkness of Pyravela this year (remember, this is partly a festival of prophecy, see [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/time/holidays-and-festivals/pyravela/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/time/holidays-and-festivals/pyravela/)) when for many it felt like all of the prophecies were ones of unspecified doom.

  

She speaks somewhat of the efforts of Lenora (the paladin), Raoul (the elder), and others to explore, to find what was happening, scattering from Embry and other centers. And the despair at seeing the dead rise, knowing premonition wasn't enough.

  

Armand nods along to this, and mentions a centaur he knows, Omphale, a prophet, who lives in the Cleenseau Wood, near Windlea (not mapped, but see [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/windlea/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/gazetteer/greater-sembara/sembara/barony-of-aveil/windlea/)), who he had been seeking (but had not found yet), who he was hoping could shed some light on the premonitions.  

  

Feel free to ask questions to this, just as questions rather than in character.

Notes:

> Timing-wise, it seems like the evil mist globe came after the attacks. The zombie attacks in Cleenseau (when Beatrix miscarried) were the morning of January 6th (and your investigation suggested that the evil mist probably created them the previous night - Jan 5th-6th, or perhaps two nights previous - Jan 4th-5th). But they certainly weren't around Jan 4th during the day.

Marcel is pretty sure the Eskbridge skeletons emerged overnight Jan 4th - 5th. The Aveil zombies were well attested by January 7th, but he isn't sure when the first appeared, could have been a day or two earlier. The Ainwick zombies were besieging the town by January 10th, but they definitely emerged between 1 and 3 days earlier, as they walked down to Ainwick from the hills. The Fellburn skeletons were outside Fellburn the morning of Jan 7th.  

  

Recall also Ida was attacked January 7th and that group of skeletons took some time to walk to the road. 

  

Maybe it was the evil mist globe? You don't know for sure how it started. But it seemed to have a very specific effect of creating zombies based on breathing the mist of being bitten by an infected creature. It didn't seem to, for example, create skeletons. You could certainly dig into the history more once you are back in Cleenseau.

Armand can give directions, which boil down to: a day's walk east of Windlea, along the Leandre (a brook that runs out of the wood). But Armand also reports Omphale wasn't actually there. He doesn't know where he would have gone exactly and he didn't have time to follow clues. None of you know exactly where Windlea is, but the Leandre is a river you know how to find: Lake Rin, as you might recall, is at the confluence of two rivers: The Enst and the Auberonne. The Leandre is a tributary of the Auberonne, joining it at Aslain (which is a town about the size of Cleenseau). Someone in Aslain would certainly know where Windlea is (also as a note, there was a disciple of the Father you met in Beury, Jean-Luc, who is from Aslain and might also know where Windlea is)
