The scene:

  

In the golden hour before sunset in late February, Areschera is lying dead in the brown grass, her final curse still on her lips. Celyn stands over her, having just pierced her heart with Silverthorne. Viepuck stands nearby, and Izgil and Robin peer down from the window, about 5 feet above the ground. Behind you is the tower, and the walls of the keep. In front of you, two guards are running towards you, and you can see Magistrate Rosseau looking down from the window next to Robin. The bloody wound on Areschera's cheek seems to still be oozing, even after death, and you can see her glittering items, in particular the red rose, her gem, and her bracers, which all seem obviously magical.

  

In the next few minutes, chaos reigns. Rosseau sends runners for more guards and advisors, Viepuck contacts Lenora Belles (the paladin of the Night Queen) [using his last Pact Magic slot], and the party stands around Areschera's body, keeping onlookers away and gathering her items.

  

Lenora responds to Viepuck's sending: 

  

Information valuable. Suspected evil in Aveil - Baroness? Close associate?. Misdirection possible. Keep **quiet. VERY DANGEROUS**, situation delicate. Meet Raoul, near Rinburg, 10 days.

  

As the chaos settles, about 30 minutes later, a small group of advisors are gathered around the party and the body:

  

**Magistrate Victorine Rosseau**, looking deeply worried but determined

**Captain Marceline Dupont**, standing outside the main group, looking scared

Two guards, standing near Captain Dupont, focused on keeping others away

**Emeric**, the steward of Veltor, a older man who mostly seems panicked about the mess the records are surely in

**Perette**, the chamberlain of the Baroness and keeper of her rooms, who seems nervous and keeps looking over her shoulder

**Julien**, one of the disciples of the Warlord based in Veltor, who was tending to some ill guards, he is in awe of the party, and inclined towards flattery and ass-kissing

**Madeline d'Aslain**, the wife of Robin d'Aslain (who is Baroness Isabeau's cousin and secretary, but who is currently travelling with the Baroness), who seems worried about further dangers to her husband and family, in particular

  

There is some chatter as to the basics of the situation - Marguerite Deschamps, the chief clerk of the barony, was replaced by a fey, now lying dead at the ground, and how the party discovered this and killed her before she could cause further harm. The magistrate shares the news about the Duskhound, which causes a mild panic that there could be more dangers in the keep. There is some talk about the Baroness' return tomorrow evening and a fair bit of relief to drop the problem on her (and her household). In particular, the secretary - **Robin d'Aslain** - currently traveling with the Baroness - is highly regarded. The most immediate concerns, however, are what to do with the body and whether there is any further danger. 

  

A search of the keep for further evidence of fey activity, led by the party, is accepted gratefully, and in general, the consensus is to regroup after there is certainty no further danger exists - the party is invited to report any findings to the Magistrate Rosseau after the search. No one seems sure what to do with the body, and, unless the party suggests anything, Captain Dupont sets a guard and waits for the search to be complete. The party is accompanied by three people on the search: Julien (as a witness), Emeric (the steward), and Perette (the chamberlain). 

  

[Meta: Feel free to add in anything you'd like to share immediately, or just continue with the flow and search the tower. I'll try to keep the email thread going through the second meeting]

  

The keep:

  

The keep of Veltor is an ancient and sprawling keep with narrow, arched windows and moss on many of the walls. Although it was clearly originally built as a major defensive fortification it does not look like it has been under siege in many many years.

There are four towers (the Tower of Records, where  Areschera was, the Baroness' Tower, the Tower of Justice, and the Kitchen Tower), each with five stories, which are connected to the main building by stone corridors. The main building has a ground floor, an upper floor, an attic, and two sub-basements. As you search the keep, Emeric is willing to unlock doors, and in general gain access. 

[Meta: I'm going to write up a basic layout of the keep below - let me know anywhere you want to search in more detail, and please include an Investigation roll for each thing you are searching in more detail or a Sleight of Hand check if you are trying to pick a lock. I’ve noted anything magical already. But also each thing you search in detail takes time, searching every room in detail would take half the night probably]

  

_The Tower of Records_

This is the heart of Areschera's domain. The ground floor stretches across the width of the tower, but all the floors above the first are built in the interior, and a staircase spirals on the exterior, with frequent narrow windows.

- The ground floor is divided into two rooms, an antechamber and entrance hall, designed for registering visitors, with an elaborate painted mural of flowers on the wall, and a formal dining room that seats about 15, still set with enchanted food and fine goblets. A locked buffet sits on one side, which Emeric indicates it contains one of the lesser quality sets of plates and silver. The key would be kept by the clerk's valet/butler, although said person is nowhere to be found at the moment. And Perette adds that it’s been at least a week since she’s seen the clerks valet. 
- The first floor is divided into three rooms: a hearing room with a dais and heavy tapestries on the walls, and two workrooms with three desks each, set for scribes and correspondence. 
- The second floor is one of the major records archives, and contains many organized folios and scrolls. It would take quite some time to search through all the paper here. There are two fine desks each with drawers and inkwells, and a complex hanging chandelier made of reflecting crystal with a central element that glows with a Continual Flame spell. Emeric indicates one of the desks was the Chief Clerk's, and the other was shared by three senior clerks. The drawers seem to contain mostly quills and blank paper.
- The third floor is where the landing you previously saw was, and opens into Arechera's suite. This is a set of three rooms - a sitting room, dressing room, and bedroom - set aside for the use of the chief clerk. The sitting room has three rich velvet chairs, a fine table with an elaborate candelabra , and three elegant mirrors on the walls (one of which appears to be magical). The dressing robe has a large wardrobe with several fine dresses as well as a few slightly incongruous outfits (an oilskin coat, a rough peasant tunic, a fine red set of robes dyed with the famous Tollen Red dye), as well as a locked jewelry box (Emeric apologies, again, he does not have the key) and a small metal chest sitting next to the wardrobe (also locked). The bedroom is dominated by a large four poster bed set covered in fine furs, and a large fireplace that seems to cleverly vent through a chimney between the walls, but is otherwise rather plain. There are three chests with additional bedding and linens, and a golden chamberpot. 
- The fourth floor is where Damien was kept, and is currently empty, although Emeric is suprised. He indicates that this is normally a dormitory and living quarters for the chief clerk's close staff. 

[Meta: To be continued - figured I'd send this now before writing up the rest of the towers and keep... also, is this a boringly large amount of detail?]

Obviously at some point we loot the magic items.  We should make sure to keep the bodies of the dusk hound and Areschera separated?  Ceyln, I’m not sure what appropriate fey disposal process is?  Bury?  Burn?  Throw in the woods to be eaten by birds (this seems like really bad idea that would likely have consequences)?

How far away IS Rinberg?  I don’t think we can make it that fast? And there’s 2 more fey to respond to.  Assuming I have a free spell slot, should I respond immediately?  Also, who was Raoul again?  I feel like I know that, but:

I tried to check maps/names, but site seems to be down?  

  

Possible Message (pending commentary from another party member): 

Complications.  Fey replaced clerk.  2 more known to south needing management immediately.  Possible necromancy needs investigating.  Unlikely able Rinburg 10 days.

Allies.

Does he report to Magistrate Rosseau?  Site down means I can’t check what Veltor means.

I should use the circlet on her to mind-scan.  DC15 for initial contact.  

  

> **Julien**, one of the disciples of the Warlord based in Veltor, who was tending to some ill guards, he is in awe of the party, and inclined towards flattery and ass-kissing

  

May or may not be useful?  Could at least give a location to store one of the bodies so we can keep them separated?  Or Warlord-blessings might keep them from being raised?  

  

> **Madeline d'Aslain**, the wife of Robin d'Aslain (who is Baroness Isabeau's cousin and secretary, but who is currently travelling with the Baroness), who seems worried about further dangers to her husband and family, in particular

  

Understandable concerns, may or may not know of necromancy, but I think is a secondary scan target?

  

> There is some chatter as to the basics of the situation - Marguerite Deschamps, the chief clerk of the barony, was replaced by a fey, now lying dead at the ground, and how the party discovered this and killed her before she could cause further harm.

  

At least Magistrate Rosseau can confirm here that the dinner was a trap we managed to spring in our favor?

Julien might be helpful here - Warlord probably has anti-necromancy rituals and protection for corpses, which is a concern given how things have gone in the south (and wow do we not want the potential necromancer to show up and have 2 fresh powerful targets).   Suggestions that they go there for proper corpse-rites?  Burning them immediately for safety also an option, but unsure how that goes over with fey.  Robin?  Ceyln?  (Not spell-suggestion)

Indeed, we need the witnesses, so even if we take the bodies to the Warlord temple it may need to be done after? 

  

> [Meta: Feel free to add in anything you'd like to share immediately, or just continue with the flow and search the tower. I'll try to keep the email thread going through the second meeting]

  

We want to make sure that there are no lingering artifacts that could exert undue influence on the baron before she returns tomorrow, so we need to make sure to search her space ASAP as well.

  

Who is officially ranking-in-charge at the moment?  (That lives here, I suspect Robin is likely to be deferred to by default by a lot of people in the current emergency.  Also now might be the time for a rousing speech to help calm people’s nerves? 

  

To Magistrate Rosseau, we do know of 2 more hostile fey in the barony further south.  They seem to be playing some kind of game and need to be confronted ASAP.  We need to search here to determine that influence is removed, but then may need to leave rapidly to deal with the others before they begin acting now that one of their number has been removed.  

  

* should I send Es’Tiasilos to go find the baron and escort/spy on the way back, or use the additional search/spy help here?

Half the night isn’t too bad….

Was the mural always there, or is it new?

We should probably avoid the enchanted food sadly, just in case there is lingering magic or it flags a different fey?  Try slopping some pigs and see what happens?  We believed it to be enchantments not poison.  

  

The goblets are standard for the castle, or new?

The key would be kept by the clerk's valet/butler, although said person is nowhere to be found at the moment. And Perette adds that it’s been at least a week since she’s seen the clerks valet. 

That’s not good, it’s entirely likely Areschera has been disappearing people who happen to get too close for some time.  Ceyln, can you get that open (Viepuck could try, but is currently not demonstrating that skill publicly., and is not as good at it). 

> - The first floor is divided into three rooms: a hearing room with a dais and heavy tapestries on the walls, and two workrooms with three desks each, set for scribes and correspondence. 

Cursory scan for magic is I think what we’re doing at the moment.  Obviously a scribe and clerk will need to sort through all of this.  Quick investigation of correspondence to check for anything out of the ordinary?  Investigation 15+5=20. 

  

> - The second floor is one of the major records archives, and contains many organized folios and scrolls. It would take quite some time to search through all the paper here. There are two fine desks each with drawers and inkwells, and a complex hanging chandelier made of reflecting crystal with a central element that glows with a Continual Flame spell. Emeric indicates one of the desks was the Chief Clerk's, and the other was shared by three senior clerks. The drawers seem to contain mostly quills and blank paper.

Largely this is a longer-term project.  I think glance through the space looking for scrolls magic  or something, but someone else is going to have to go through all the correspondence and records.  Quick check for secret compartments in the desks, or skip it?  (If checking, 19+5=24, otherwise will use elsewhere?  Thus the hazards of play-by-mail.).

Um…. Is that mirror supposed to be magical?  (If not, could be a fey communication device?  If not supposed to be or not known to be magical, how large is it.  If already known to be magical, what does it do?). 

  

> - The dressing robe has a large wardrobe with several fine dresses as well as a few slightly incongruous outfits (an oilskin coat, a rough peasant tunic, a fine red set of robes dyed with the famous Tollen Red dye),

Costumes?  Could she not replicate those in the changing?

Celyn - I think this is your department.  Emeric - were these items already here, or arrived recently?  

> - The bedroom is dominated by a large four poster bed set covered in fine furs, and a large fireplace that seems to cleverly vent through a chimney between the walls, but is otherwise rather plain. There are three chests with additional bedding and linens, and a golden chamberpot. 

The rest all seems standard? Do a basic walk-about dragging fingers along walls, sweeping under beds with a stick, etc.  Basically trying to determine if there are any other illusory-concealed spaces.  Investigation 17+5=22 (Using the dice cloud roll had been favorable apparently) 

> - The fourth floor is where Damien was kept, and is currently empty, although Emeric is suprised. He indicates that this is normally a dormitory and living quarters for the chief clerk's close staff. 

Who have all been moved out and murdered to make room, likely.  Sadly low on Sending spells to see if anyone is alive, or can I short-rest-equivalent while searching?  Also while Viepuck technically NEEDS a long rest for health, I can get up in the middle of the night every hour or so and do a couple Sendings that way regularly?  That is, if Es’Tiasilos or someone else wants to work as an alarm clock…. 

  

> [Meta: To be continued - figured I'd send this now before writing up the rest of the towers and keep... also, is this a boringly large amount of detail?]

  

Anyone else have commentary on this?  My major concern is the baron’s tower, to “make sure that there are no hidden influences so it is safe for her return”.

Website is at [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/) - that's an old link. It is 65 miles to Rinberg (and only 30 miles from either Peydon (hag) or Ashcombe (hunter)). It is normally ~3 days but you could potentially be a bit quicker. If you left immediately, and didn't spend more than ~3 days on each fey, you could make it to Rinberg in 10 days. But also you guess that is read as something like "~10 days" not "a specific date". 

  

Raoul was the mega-powerful cleric of Night Queen who cast Forbiddance during the battle outside Fellburn. He was working closely with Lenora (paladin) and was named as one of the people Robin wanted to return to Embry for questioning-about-necromancers.

You don't have any Pact spell slots at the moment (you used one during the battle I think, and one to cast sending just now), although you could short rest to regain them (presumably after you search the tower - you can't short rest while searching)

He works for the Baroness directly. Veltor is the town you are in. He is basically the person the baroness appointed to run the local town (and he seems to have a good handle on the management of the keep/castle itself as well)

Yes, my assumption is that you searched the fey tower and the baroness' tower thoroughly and the rest briefly. None of these folk are objecting. I am working on a similar-level-of-detail on the baroness' tower and a "short search" of the rest of the keep email, which will be out soonish (but I was going to save until we have resolved this thread, I think, to avoid too much going on at once)

  

One other general note, Emeric is happy for you to pick locks and so forth. If there is something he or Perette (the chamberlain) don't want to you to poke at, I will indicate in the initial writeup. (Kiya, you mentioned +10 on one of your lockpicking attempts, did you mean you have a +10 to a roll or that you rolled a 10?)

  

More answers on the meet of the questions in a bit.

From Kiya:

Adding a little roleplay bit in here because I finally have a little space in my brain for it.

The chaos does not appear to affect him at all; in fact, for the first minute or two of it, once he has put Silverthorn back into its state of invisibility, he is entirely focused on Robin unless something actively interrupts that.  Not doing anything in particular with it, just all of his attention seems to be aimed that way until he appears to see something that releases him to pay attention to anything - and in his case apparently everything - else.  
  
Which he mostly treats with a certain benign curiosity.  (Unsurprising to the party, possibly disconcerting to the ordinary folks who saw him take out the fey in a fit of speedy violence.)  
  
  
He is of course amiable all through doing the tower searches and such, and very much deferring to the locals and being clear on requesting witnesses to demonstrate everything is on the up-and-up whenever he picks a lock, but we sorted that out elsewhere in the thread, I am just reiterating because I am too tired to be efficient and my brain is stuck.  
  
(I feel like I’m missing things to react to but maybe not I am just looping so I will stop and send.)

Not only is it potentially more important than ever that we deal with the other competitors, but if the Baroness _is_ a/the real problem - then being here with a whole mess of evidence that we killed one of her people is a sticky situation we may not want to be present for to sort out. 

[meta: I think the best thing is going to be to have the first 30-45 minutes of game in two weeks be resolving exactly what you are doing. I'm prepared for either sticking around and dealing with the Baroness or heading after the Hunter, but I assume you are definitely planning on going Hunter -> Hag rather than Hag -> Hunter? The one thing I haven't prepped is you heading for the Hag. I don't want to drop the discussion/plot/etc if not everyone can participate over email; that said, especially post-Tuesday I'm prepared to resolve it over email if everyone wants/is up for it]

The implication of the sending from Lenora is that a secret necromancer is **not** a surprise to her, and she knows more than she can easily put in a 25-word message. I would expect (hint, hint) Raoul to have quite a bit of information.


From Kiya:

Okay, in the spirit of taking my own damn advice and doing things that are about having some damn fun, and because I finally have space in my brain for actual game stuff, I am responding to this bit so we can maybe get something sorted out before next weekend and also because Celyn is a noisy boy with many opinions and I will let him have his space to have some of them.On Nov 2, 2024, at 12:55 PM, Artan Eter <[artan.eter@gmail.com](mailto:artan.eter@gmail.com)> wrote:

> Obviously at some point we loot the magic items.  We should make sure to keep the bodies of the dusk hound and Areschera separated?  Ceyln, I’m not sure what appropriate fey disposal process is?  Bury?  Burn?  Throw in the woods to be eaten by birds (this seems like really bad idea that would likely have consequences)? I am assuming that a) Viepuck has conveyed the information he got from reading Areschera’s mind before I stabbed her with the party (presumably sequences of telepathic pings) and b) we have had a little bit of chaos milling around and people are looking for coherent direction.  Further that the relevant NPCs are present to witness and agree that I am making sense.  Also, Celyn is getting to be a devious little fucker and I am pleased with that.  
  
  
After some of the ongoing chaos has petered out, people have proposed various things, and the general need to decide what to do with the fey bodies has been established, Celyn gathers the relevant administrative NPCs to include them in his thoughts, and then says:  
  
“I advise we prepare to burn the bodies.  We do not know the appropriate rites for the fey to do this properly according to their standards.  They do not answer to our gods, and further, as you can see from the way she bleeds even though she does not breathe, there remains an unholy magic here.  I do not know where to arrange for a pyre, but perhaps the Warlord’s temple could host? He could perhaps be asked to extend himself to contain whatever corruption might emerge from her remains so that it does not extend this battle needlessly.”  This with a glance at the Warlord’s acolyte.  
  
He continues, with only the slightest pause, “I suggest this in part because I do not wish to extend the battle in other ways.  Given the repeated uprisings of the undead, we cannot afford the risk of allowing a necromancer to possibly raise such powerful beings again to act against us.  We should have the fires going before deep dark.”  A little flip of the hand - not quite his dice-throwing tic gesture, but not far from it - and he adds, “We know the Baroness is greatly concerned with the matter of necromancy, after all, and will appreciate that we have taken such measures to protect Veltor and its people.”  Celyn is fully capable of keeping a straight face here, and absolutely does.  
  
He is not done, though; once he’s given that enough time to sink in he continues:  “I cannot recommend anything that the fey might consider a deep desecration.  They may be offended by a pyre, but I believe they will understand that the abomination of being compelled by dark magic to rise up after death was worth preventing.  They would definitely be offended by many other things.  They would likely prefer that a delegation convey her to her homeland, but that is not practical; the portal we know of is some distance from here, we cannot keep the body from becoming corrupt by natural processes in the time involved, and we have other, far more pressing concerns involving the other fey who are working their trickery upon Aveil.”  
  
Then he adds, “Besides, it is unacceptable to treat an opponent with such honor when she has been using her deceptions to bring about the torture, imprisonment, and death of innocents in Veltor and the region. Given we know specifically of two murders and her attempt to frame an innocent man in [whatever that town was], among her other acts, it is a matter of principle to instead demonstrate her threat ended, securely, here, in the heart of where her crimes were committed.”  And here he does not quite manage to keep a straight face; he does look over at Robin with a badly-repressed grin, as if to say ‘I would not have bothered with the matter of principle part but you are an influence on me’.  “She does not merit an honorable return to her court."  
  
He concludes with, “May fortune continue to favor us all, and hope light our way."
