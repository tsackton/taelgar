The mural was always here. Perette (the chamberlain) remembers her grandmother telling a story of the artisans who painted in, shortly after Queen Cece's coronation [meta: its been here a long time and is not related to the fey at all].

Izgil's Detect Magic suggested it was some type of will-dulling effect that would make Arechersa's (or perhaps anyones?) spells more effective against you [meta: Disadvantage to Wisdom+Charisma saves for an hour]. It is definitely still magical although Izgil expects the magic will fade as the food rots.

> The goblets are standard for the castle, or new? 

  

The goblets are part of the set of serving ware that Emeric indicates is in the buffet. You do notice that most of the goblets and plates on the table are rimmed with silver, but one place setting at the head (Arechersa's) is rimming with gold. It is true that after the combat, this room is a bit of a mess, and probably as much as half the food is spilled across the floor and one of the goblets and two of the plates are cracked, which Emeric looks angry about, although he clearly places the blame on Arechersa, not you.

> > - A locked buffet sits on one side, which Emeric indicates it contains one of the lesser quality sets of plates and silver. The key would be kept by the clerk's valet/butler, although said person is nowhere to be found at the moment. And Perette adds that it’s been at least a week since she’s seen the clerks valet.

Yes, Emeric and Julien both seem concerned about this, and in brief conversation, it seems that all four of the servants of the Tower of Records (the maids and body servants who would normally serve the chief clerk) are missing. One was dismissed soon after the clerk was ill, one died of an illness shortly after the clerk was ill and was never replaced, but the other two no one knows what happened to them. Celyn opens the buffet which, as Emeric noted, appears to contain more plates and goblets and such, some rimmed in gold and others in silver. Izgil notes that several of the plates are radiating a faint magic, similar to the magic the food is radiating, and Celyn notices that the silver (but not gold) plates are sprinkled with a very faint covering of dust, which appears to be the source of the magic. Izgil guesses that this dust - when mixed with food - generates the will-dulling effect. It would be impossible to recover the dust from the plates, but easy to destroy the magic simply by washing the plates thoroughly. It does seem like the party were not the only people  Arechersa tried to enchant to make it easier for her spells to take effect.

Viepuck pokes around the rooms and notes nothing out of the ordinary. The desks were all recently used, and it seems all as he'd expect for a busy clerk's offices and scribal rooms.  

> > - The second floor is one of the major records archives, and contains many organized folios and scrolls. It would take quite some time to search through all the paper here. There are two fine desks each with drawers and inkwells, and a complex hanging chandelier made of reflecting crystal with a central element that glows with a Continual Flame spell. Emeric indicates one of the desks was the Chief Clerk's, and the other was shared by three senior clerks. The drawers seem to contain mostly quills and blank paper.

I assume you check for secret compartments and such. Like the previous floor, this all seems like usual court business. There are no secret compartments or magic scrolls that you find. If you spent a couple of hours reading through the correspondence, you might be able to get some sense of the active controversies in the barony. It is a bit unusual to let a stranger just read through the entire private correspondence, but your sense is if you did it this evening no one would object. Once the Baroness returns and some "normalcy" returns to the court, it might be harder.

> > - The third floor is where the landing you previously saw was, and opens into Arechera's suite. This is a set of three rooms - a sitting room, dressing room, and bedroom - set aside for the use of the chief clerk. The sitting room has three rich velvet chairs, a fine table with an elaborate candelabra , and three elegant mirrors on the walls (one of which appears to be magical).
> 
> Um…. Is that mirror supposed to be magical?  (If not, could be a fey communication device?  If not supposed to be or not known to be magical, how large is it.  If already known to be magical, what does it do?). 

**MOST INTERESTING PART**

No, Emeric is surprised that the mirror is magical. In fact, he doesn't recognize any of the mirrors, nor do Julian or Perette. There are three mirrors, all the same, about 16" high and 8" wide, oval-shaped, with a bronze frame sculpted to look like vines. The only differences between the mirrors are: in one, the vines are budding, in one (the magic one) they are in full leaf, and in the final one, they are leafless and just branches. Celyn [with his extraordinary perception] notices a word in Elvish carved on the top of the frame of each mirror: Dreams (on the budding one); Truth (on the magic one); Lies (on the leafless one). They are hung to the wall but easy to take down, if you wanted. The magic is Divination.

>

Her clothes changed with her when she transformed from the clerk to her true self, so you think she can replicate them. The three odd outfits don't look quite the same size as the others, and Celyn notices a spot of blood on the collar of the peasant tunic.

>

Emeric recognizes the jewelry box - it comes with these rooms and has been part of the Tower of Records for some time. The metal chest, he does not recognize. Celyn picks both locks. The jewelry box is pretty much as it seems - it holds four necklaces, three rings, and a brooch. One of the rings is missing, but the rest of the jewelry is here. Perette, who seems somewhat familiar with the various jewels of Aveil, confirms that these are all longstanding items associated with the chief clerk and/or the Barony - mini jewels of state, basically. You can probably surmise that any jewelry Areschera had that _does not_ belong in this box were her personal items. The metal chest is somewhat more interesting. It is lead-lined, preventing detection of magic, and when you open it you see several neat organized velvet sections. The top part of the chest is a velvet and wood piece divided into 16 little squares, each able to hold a small vial or box. 7 are empty, but the remaining 9 contain 5 small wooden boxes (the size of a small spice box) each containing a magical dust, and 4 glass vials each containing a magical potion. Underneath, is another velvet and wood holder, with four sections all empty. Finally, under that, is the base of the chest, which has a small wood divider splitting it into two sections. One of the two sections is stained with some dried blood and flecks of ash and odd black splotches. The other half of the chest is bare.

She had two rings and a brooch in non-magical jewelry. One of them (the ring with a small ruby) is part of the Barony's collection and is the missing ring here.

Each of the five boxes has very different looking dust in it. These are probably all different things. It is impossible to tell if they are the same or different from the dust on the plates with just Arcana - you'd need to identify them.

All different. You can identify a potion just by sipping a bit, unlike other items.
