While in Champimont, you hear a number of rumors, listed below. I've added notes about sources and what information Vahaiya or some of their Rangers can confirm. Some of these are potentially repeats of rumors you heard elsewhere.

There are a number of people with family or relationships with the Western Army who seem to be fleeing towards the army, with the idea that it might provide safety. These people are your main source of reliable news. There do not seem to be any official messengers or dispatch riders, although perhaps the lord of Champimont, Lord Raoul Montagu, would know more. (You could certainly call on him in the morning if you wanted, although that might delay your start to Rinburg).

> Really we should probably stop by as reliable people to get messages towards other areas.  Viepuck will duck out during the dinner briefly to stop by the lord’s manor to make introduction to the watch-on-duty that evening as the herald of Robin, Paladin of the Chariable Wanderer, Acting Captain of the Guard of Clenseau,  (I don’t know if you have preferred titles) .  We are proceeding onward from recent troubles in Clenseau to help in Rinburg and then Felburn and can convey messages if no other news is getting through.  We ride with some haste tomorrow morning, but will stop by briefly before heading out if Lord Montagu has anything he wishes conveyed to either destination or has time for a brief meeting.


>Viepuck stops by the manor house, and is welcomed politely. At the word Cleenseau, the guard perks up. "Ah, you are from Cleenseau", she says. "Robin of Abenfyrd, is that who you are talking about? A message rider is overnighting here, the first news we've had from Rinburg since these awful attacks. He was planning on trying to make it as far as Cleenseau tomorrow, with a letter, he said, for the guard captain there, one Robin of Abenfyrd. He brought several other letters for my Lord, including one from the Lord Mayor of Rinburg, Alaric. It seemed to bear news, although I don't know what was in it. Nothing good, I fear." 

> Viepuck responses, in some fashion indicating that yes, they are talking about the same Robin, and the guard responds: "Wait a moment, good page". She comes back a few minutes later with a mug of hot spiced wine and a shrivelled apple and hunk of think brown bread with butter (all for Viepuck) and asks you to wait a bit. She makes idle conversation as you wait, mostly about her children, nieces, and nephews. About thirty minutes later, an older man, who introduces himself as Claude, Lord Motagu's chamberlain, and who has two letters in his hand, appears.

> "Good page", he says, "Please take these. We would be honored if Robin would visit us in the morning before you head out. Lord Montagu would be pleased to meet you for breakfast, at your convenience."
 
> He hands two letters to the guard, and whispers something to her. She escorts you back to the Elegant Swan, and when you point out Robin, she asks him briefly where he is from, and when he responds, "Abenfyrd", she hands over two letters.  She seems chatty and good natured, and apologizes to Viepuck for the necessity (of not just trusting him), but says, "Times like these.."

Letters: [[Letter from Alaric Lord Mayor of Rinburg]] and [[Letter from Rosalind (January 14th)]]

**Gowerborne**

The rumors on everyone's lips is news about the Battle of Gowerborne. It is fairly clear that the Duke of Wisford, Jacques Bellemont, has raised an army (of sorts) and ridden north to the Wistel, where he was planning (or has) fought a battle against a large force of skeletons. Although some people have said the Duke was victorious but died in battle, others that he lives and is riding south with the tattered remains of his army, and others that he has suffered a major defeat -- when pressed, no one seems to have any real knowledge. 

**Fellburn**

News from Fellburn is clearer. Several people in Champimont were fleeing from villages around Fellburn and have recently arrived in town in the wake of the road opening. These are first hand accounts, and report that Fellburn is still under siege, and the resistance is disorganized and desperate. There are rumors (but perhaps, more like hopes?) of messengers bearing news from the Duke or the King (unclear who) that help is coming, but little concrete evidence. No one you talk to has been inside the walls of Fellburn. The skeletal army is variously reported to be 500, 1000, or 2000 strong. Whatever the strength, there are several eyewitness accounts of skeletons flinging bones hundreds of feet, and that these flung bones pierce flesh like spears. 

> You ask for more details from a couple of the people with firsthand accounts and they all seem to agree that there is nothing larger than a hobgoblin or human around. One person says she saw two skeletons with tattered clothes and shields painted with the blackened claw sigil you now recognize from the wight. These two skeletons were cracking bones off a third skeleton and throwing them. As she watched, a fingerbone would grow to the size of a spear. But, the skeleton they were breaking bones off of did not seem to regrow them.

>Secondly, and this would be clear from the conversation with people about the Duke of Wisford, Fellburn is the second largest city in the Duchy of Wisford, and quite important. You don't really have enough information to know why he didn't immediately ride for Fellburn, but unless he was defeated at Gowerbourne and is now dead or something, Fellburn is surely high on his list of places to defend.


**Rinburg**

Similarly, there are several people from Rinburg, again mostly fleeing. The lake (Lake Rin) is dangerous, and people are afraid. The stories you hear are mostly about how anyone who goes out on the lake for more than twenty or thirty minutes is swallowed by a creature that looks like a giant dead eel. It seems to emerge, its head tearing at boats, and sinking them, and the water churns with blood, and then it is over. People have stopped going out on the lake. But the creature doesn't seem to have left the lake, so the river crossing by ferry is still safe. 

Vahaiya and their crew came through Rinburg two days ago, and can also confirm that a wizard resident in Rinburg, Corrine Morphokamia, was gathering a group to try to deal with the monster. Several of the people in Champimont can confirm that some attempt to defeat this creature was made, but it failed. Whether there were survivors they don't know.

>The lake is about 3-4 miles across, fairly circular, and is actually a mile or two upriver of Rinburg itself. There are five villages on the lakeshore, and the first attacks were on ferryboats and such traversing the lake. One person thinks there have been several attacks along shore, but another person says that isn't true, no one has dared go out in the lake since the fifth attack, and all five attacks were more towards the middle of the lake. A third person tells you he is from Lynthia, the largest town on the south bank, and a lizardfolk who live near there told him the monster wouldn't come within 100' of shore.

  
There is a big rocky shoal in the middle of the lake, about 200 or 300 feet across, where the lake is only a foot or so deep (i.e. it is basically an underwater rock formation that is almost an island). I don't know if that helps your planning.
**The Borderlands**

The Borderlands are the various baronies scattered south of the Enst, mostly farther east than here (there are no settlements west of Rinburg on the south bank of the Enst, but starting from Rinburg the land south of the Enst is lightly settled). There are some scattered rumors about the Borderlands -- that a huge horde of undead is marching from the Darkwood and has destroyed the Rangers, that the Army of the South was sent to face a huge horde of undead, that the baronies south of the Enst are in chaos, with hundreds of manorial lords dead. But Vahaiya can confirm that at least when they were marching through the borderlands a few days ago, none of these were true.

You do hear some rumors that the Army of the South is chasing something south of the Enst and that is why it wasn't in Fellburn to defend against the skeletons, which Vahaiya cannot confirm or deny. They did hear rumors during their march of units of the Army of the South passing through, but didn't have time to follow up on them.  

**Aveil**

Aveil is the barony you are in now -- it stretches from Cleenseau to Rinburg along the river and then north ~100 miles. Most of the people in the barony live in the Aurbonne river valley (the Aurbonne is a river that joins the Enst near Rinburg and forms Lake Rin). There is scattered news from the north of Aveil: that the baroness is hiding in the old guerilla caves in the hills while dozens or perhaps a hundred zombies wander through various villages, or alternatively, that the baroness' fortified seat (Velator) has fallen or perhaps been abandoned. Or that the baroness is raising troops. (Several people are heading north chasing what they feel is pretty firm word that the baroness is raising troops).

Regardless of the truth there doesn't seem to be a big army of undead, like in Fellburn or Gowerbourne.

**Farther Afield**

There is very little news from farther afield that is reliable, but a few rumors you hear:

* No zombies have been seen north of the Wistel
* Embry has fallen to zombies and Sembara is doomed
* Tyrwingha is overrun by spectres and shades, the spirit of everyone who ever died has come back to life in Tyrwingha
* Tyrwingha is quiet, no undead have been seen there
* Eskbridge, a fortified town on the Enst along the border with Tyrwingha was the site of a major battle
