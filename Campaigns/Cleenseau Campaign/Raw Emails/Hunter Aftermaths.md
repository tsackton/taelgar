n the aftermath of the battle, the waning moon shining down, everyone is still for a minute. The Hunter is still out there, scurrying away towards his escape home. The Duskhound's body is oddly distorted, the moonlight seeming to flee away from it, and dark lines starting to grow from it towards the enchanted tree stump.

  

Viepuck is sitting with his back to a tree, his face downcast, seeming lost in sad thoughts. Celyn and Robin are quietly talking, Greymalkin is pacing the woods, restless and unsatisfied. Izgil picks up one of the spears, and says softly: "Huh. The magic is fading, but I could probably learn something, if I look quickly."

  

The cave mouth is dark, whatever lights lit it extinguished. Viepuck is the first to notice two bears lumbering out of the cave mouth. It looks like a mama bear and her teenage cub. White streaks on their backs are rapidly fading to black as you watch, and they run into the woods, fleeing, as if awakening from a nightmare. Moments later, a flock of ravens appear - their white tail feathers falling off them... one.. two... five... fifteen.. With a screech the flock wheels over the party, and flies south, again, as if fleeing the scene of torment.

  

Moments later, the footsteps of a young child, perhaps six or seven. "Uncle Rufus?" she calls. "Did you come to save me? The scary beast said the bear would eat me... But he ran off." She notices the party. "Oh. Who are you? Did the Wildling send you to me?"

  

[meta: Rufus is the apprentice temple administrator for the Wildling temple in Ashecombe who you met in an email interlude between sessions. He is the adopted son of Alban, the current temple administrator]

  

[ If no one feels like RP-email, I have more of the scene to wrap up some aftermaths, but pausing here for 24 hours-ish if wants to jump in ]

From Kiya:

Okay, I have finished a pile of Tasks, I shall reward myself by doing gaming email response.  
  
  
For general information: Celyn’s general vibe of upbeat, amiable distraction has been a bit dented the last day, since after Robin’s abduction and rescue.  Rather than flitting about as the fancy takes him like usual, he has been sticking very close to Robin whenever there isn’t something else for one of them to be doing that precludes that.  (His previous tendency to downplay his attachment to Robin in public is pretty much gone at the moment.)  
  
His general twitchiness may remind people that he says that the person he used to be was named after a bird - he has that sort of fluttery anxiousness about him.  Several times, people may note him doing a small ritual, after which he seems to be doing better for a bit, before whatever benefit he got from it wears off and he starts getting twitchy again.  
  
At one point he diverts to say something to Greymalkin, which I may wind up writing as a little vignette at some point to send to Dan and Mike but have not done so yet.

([rummages in mails to refresh my memory] Ah yes the trans man with the possible dark side.  Celyn talked to him a fair amount because he gets all Wyrdling cleric about the troubled trans people.)  
  
Celyn shifts his attention towards the child as she appears, with a ripple of tension that fades near-immediately as she continues speaking; his temper is running a little hair-trigger, yet, but she’s obviously not a threat.  He manages to set the flicker aside quickly enough she may not notice, and puts on something akin to his usual amiability with such deliberateness that for a moment it’s visibly a performance.  
  
“Not the Wildling,” he says, going down to one knee to be closer to her height.  (He’s short but not THAT short.)  “But I have met your uncle Rufus, and I am sure he’d be glad to know you’re safe.”  He absently tugs the theatre-masks pendant he uses as a holy symbol out of his shirt - he has been tucking it inside his shirt every time he does that ritual, the past day.
