**January 3rd**  

Rosalind is summoned to King Robert's court, and departs that evening with her husband (Arthur), her advisor Eremon, Ames Benthey, and most of the Lord's Guard of Cleenseau depart for Embry.

**January 5th**

Beatrix's neighbors are sick. As far as you can tell, this evening is when Beatrix, Cedric, and Oudine (the women who died and who's baby introduced the zombie plague) were infected. 

**January 6th**

Beatrix miscarries and the first zombie baby explodes in the morning. 
Rosalind is in Rinburg in the morning and continues onto Fellburn. 
Ida is attacked by zombies on the road west of Cleenseau in the mid-afternoon. 
Rosalind's children climb out of the river and attack Beury. 
Rinburg evening ferry attacked by skeletons (rumor)

**January 7th**

Taviose is attacked by a handful of zombies. 
Valit is attacked by a skeleton riding a skeletal horse.
Another zombie attack occurs in Cleenseau, of exploding zombies, and Ysabel is killed. 
The party descends into the fort in the morning and defeats the wight in the evening.
Just before midnight zombies attack Cleenseau from the south, around midnight (night of Jan 7-8).

**January 8th**

Dispatch rider sees a horrible undead creature feasting on the dead of the town of Eftly (40 miles from Cleenseau). When the town was slaughtered is not clear.  

**Rumors**
The messenger who brings Rosalind's letter passed covered the 60 miles to Rinburg in 2 days. He was in Dallet (one of the larger towns along the road, about 20 miles from Cleenseau) the evening of the 6th and spent the night there, and as far as he knows nothing bad had happened. However on January 10th two dispatch riders heading to Dunfry and the Army of the West stopped briefly in town on their way. You didn't talk to them, but they brought tales of the Rinburg ferry overwhelmed by skeletons on the south bank of the Enst and sunk with 25 dead, and the entire town of Eftly on the Enst, between Dallet and Rinburg slaughtered by a terrifying creature who was standing over the corpses of the town feeding on their bodies and emitting a horrible stench.

You don't have a good sense as to the accuracy of these rumors, they are brought to you at the Essford Manor by Duncan Rivers, the innkeeper who had an issue with missing ale, and who says he gave the riders a change of horses early on the morning of the 10th

**Responses**

Viepuck:
> Oh - I don’t know if we included that we recovered the last body from Rosalind’s children non-zombified.  I expect Reynald would want appropriate funeral rights, and those should be done sooner rather than later?  Not-zombified means if they have a family crypt or something body can go there? 
  
>Viepuck is deeply concerned with “horrifying stench creature eating Eftly” 20 miles away and feels like that is something that we may need to ride out to address.  I dont’ know how to track such a thing. (EsTiasilos can be a small dog, so gains scent tracking, maybe that will be enough?  But is not a skilled tracker (advantage on an unskilled check for the keen sense). 
 
>Also, what is happening with Robin’s fancy new semi-gryphon thing?  Does that just hang around being super shiny all the time, or does it just show up out of nowhere when needed?  Because if he was concened about drawing too much attention before, wow is that unavoidable now if it just hangs out in the stables. 
  
>Also, he has a good horse, if we need additional transit we still have access to the good horse?  I suspect we are on good terms now?

>(Dan - as part of the “Viepuck is half squire half magic-student” I have been asking for lessons on armor use (breastplate) and probalby some animal familiarity.  To this point I probalby haven’t had much access to riding animals, so I figure this doesn’t need specific competency for mounted combat, just standard adventurer getting about.  Mike has said that I can spend a competency to take ONE item of medium armor, and seeing the usefulness of armor, yes, armor. )

I think we had effectively "deputized" some folks to perform funeral rites for folks we can't get to. Robin will see to Rosalind's dead children since we know her and might consider her something of a friend.

Seems like it might not be super hard to find once we get in the area, it doesn't sound subtle...  

> Also, what is happening with Robin’s fancy new semi-gryphon thing?  Does that just hang around being super shiny all the time, or does it just show up out of nowhere when needed?  Because if he was concened about drawing too much attention before, wow is that unavoidable now if it just hangs out in the stables.  

I think subtlety kind of went out the window for us a while ago just by virtue all the stuff we've been in the middle of. Anyway, think of him as being a distraction that will make people less likely to notice your inter-dimensional flying octopus. Robin will mention he can go "elsewhere" if needed for a time and Robin can call him back. The extra notice may even help us on the political front if we need to start encouraging area nobles to cooperate...  

Incidentally, Robin will tell you the griffon's name is Greymalkin (yes, the blue and purple griffon is named something that translates roughly to "grey cat"), and they are able to speak to each other telepathically. Greymalkin does not in fact hang around the stables, does not set foot in one, and seems to prefer to hunt for his own food. When we're inside somewhere he will tend to wander off and find some green space to settle in...usually the more cover and shadows the better, often nested in a clump of bushes and staring intently from the leaves as though waiting to pounce on something. He also tends to give off an air of wary seriousness and is frequently glancing around suspiciously.

Yes. Robin will in fact ask if you're willing to take on caring for (and riding) Noble (Robin's horse). He's a well trained and even tempered war horse, so actually a good mount to learn on and wont spook in combat. We can discuss in game if you like.
