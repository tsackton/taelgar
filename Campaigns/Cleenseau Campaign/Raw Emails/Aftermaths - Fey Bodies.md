>Obviously at some point we loot the magic items.  We should make sure to keep the bodies of the dusk hound and Areschera separated?  Ceyln, I’m not sure what appropriate fey disposal process is?  Bury?  Burn?  Throw in the woods to be eaten by birds (this seems like really bad idea that would likely have consequences)? 

  
There is no specific rites or rituals that humans follow with fey bodies. A dead fey is not a common occurrence and there is no formalized ritual around it. Celyn's sense would be that if a fey he cared about -- say Ampelos - died, he would want to return the body to the Feywild (or more specifically, Twilight's Grace, Ethlenn's court). If that wasn't possible, burial near or amongst fey sites or magic would be preferred. That said, of course there are stories: the bodies of powerful fey harboring curses, or transmuting into other things, or most commonly, disappearing. There is magic in Areschera’s body, you are pretty sure— if for no other reason than 30 minutes after she died the bloody scar on her face is still oozing blood. 

Burning is the most common way of disposing of such things. But, if you wanted to treat Areschera has an honorable enemy (and of course, you may very well not!), returning her body to Duskmire would be the way to do it. Or failing that, burial somewhere connected to the fey - standing stones or some such (of course you have no idea where such places are near here). 

  > Julien might be helpful here - Warlord probably has anti-necromancy rituals and protection for corpses, which is a concern given how things have gone in the south  
 

Julien doesn’t have much to add on bodies. Keeping the dead from rising is the Night Queen’s responsibility. He can pray to the Warlord to ask the Night Queen to keep these bodies wholesome but he doesn’t have magic (except that one time he managed inspire some of Marceline DuPont’s horse guard when they rode out after some bandits- there swords rang true and never missed). 

He does mention the temple to the Warlord in Veltor is quite ancient, and is said to be thick with the memory of ancient miracles. He can arrange to have the bodies kept at the temple for now if you want.
