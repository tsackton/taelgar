Viepuck at some point when the chaos starts winding down will note that he is intending to meet Lenora before either we or she leaves.  This isn’t quite stated as an invitation, but isn’t NOT an invitation?  He won’t motion for anyone else to come along but also won’t stop them.   
  
When Lenora is finally spotted, assuming we spot her first, Viepuck will sort of que-up-to-be-noticed.  A bit hesitant, not wanting to get in the way, obviously nervous in that way of someone meeting a bigger-than-life idol.  When he gets a chance to speak it will staggered, choppy and coming-up-to-speed in a way that you’ve never seen him hesitate speaking before.   
  
V: um….  hi…. Hello.  Sir (appropriate paladin title?) Lenora?  Um.  Armand told me you were the one from….  I just wanted to get a chance to thank you before you leave.  I’m sure you have a lot of other things to do.  But thank you.  Thank you for saving me.   
  
Viepuck seems to lose some of the nervousness now, having done the thing that needed to be done, and regain a little bit of composure.   He is perfectly expecting Lenora to nod majestically and walk off in the manner of some distant divine figure, so has nothing else to say unless addressed.   
  
And yes, that was vague and did not give any context.  I have no idea if she would recognize me/us from riding about and blasting skeletons that were trying to flee the battlefield, that isn’t vaguely toward front-of-mind.  (OOC, I expect she will respond and there will be clarification, IC, Viepuck is a bit star-struck, and she represents a significant turning point in his life)

Lenora looks up at this. You've not exactly interrupted her, but you've caught her grooming her pegasus and repacking her gear - she seems to be planning to depart soon. She's just finished talking to one of the Duke's household, and you hear her saying... "... to Rinburg, then north I think. Tinugin will get me to Embry in three days, from there. I shall speak to the Duke in Embry." (This isn't particularly secret, there are plenty of people milling around, it isn't like you are spying or anything.) After the Duke's squire leaves, she is whispering to her pegasus, and packing some gear, and after a moment Viepuck steps up and speaks.

And unlooked for allies always deserve gratitude and thanks." She bows briefly, and reaches out her hand over you, in benediction, and her voice rings clearly: "May the Lady of the Night bless your sleep, and watch you in the dark places you will travel, and keep the darkness wholesome wherever your steps may trod." You feel a moment of ease, like a soft cloak is wrapping you up safely.  
  
The best conceptual reaction to this is not really in-period, but roughly “my favorite rock star liked my demo tape!  Wheee!”

Handy.

Viepuck is a little flustered, Dan mentioned coming along roughly to give introductions, so probably steps in here to stabilize the situation and provide introductions, so I will assume that slots in here.  When Robin is done speaking, Viepuck will continue, a little more stable but still more being-12 than the competent orator he sometimes presents as.   
  
V: "Yes, apologies, I usually have a better composure, this has just been something I’ve wondered about since…. It was some years back.  I didn’t remember you specifically, mostly the armor and the event.  Armand thankfully pointed me in your direction.  There was a wizard in Embry a few years back.  He was sacrificing orphans to something.  I was among them, waiting.  You interrupted the ritual enough that things went wrong, I was saved.  Everything changed that day, and is why I’m here now. "  
  
"I couldn’t quite think straight for a few weeks after, and by that point things around me had settled, you were gone and no one told me who had been there, just my new role.  The others… “ (almost like Viepuck is remembering but also realizing the sacrifice of the situation and what that meant at the time). “I’m so sorry for their loss.  If you could share a few words of them (does not be done in game) such that I may honor them appropriately I would appreciate that…”  
  
(Viepuck sort of trails off for a moment, half reliving, half realizing, half star-struck, slowly trying to gain composure.  The Mind Probe is probalby reflexive and not noticed, but Lenora would during this get that flood of recall.)
  

Lenora looks up. "Saving you? I am glad to see you, for I wished to share the Night Queen's blessing with you. I saw you on the battlefield. And unlooked for allies always deserve gratitude and thanks." She bows briefly, and reaches out her hand over you, in benediction, and her voice rings clearly: "May the Lady of the Night bless your sleep, and watch you in the dark places you will travel, and keep the darkness wholesome wherever your steps may trod." You feel a moment of ease, like a soft cloak is wrapping you up safely.

She continues. "But I do not recall saving any of you. May I be introduced?"

From Dan:

I will make introductions for Viepuck as my page and comrad in arms (and every one else), and will say it was of great relief to arrive here and find the situation well in hand. Our struggle was starting to feel like a very lonely one.
