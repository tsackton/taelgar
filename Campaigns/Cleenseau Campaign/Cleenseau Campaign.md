The game begins in late October in the year 5852 since the birth of the world, as the [[dwarves]] count, or as the year is more usually known in [[Sembara]], 7 Robert I, the 7th year of King [[Robert I]] of [[Sembara]]'s reign. Scholars of the ancient [[Drankorian Empire]] would say the year was DR 1719 and many across [[Greater Sembara]] would use those count of years.

In [[Sembara]], the summer has been bad. The monsoon rains which usually arrive in April and bring nurturing rain in gentle measure from the [[Green Sea]] came late, and when they did come, brought downpours and flooding. A diplomatic envoy from [[Lavnoch]] was found murdered in her bedchamber while visiting the king in [[Embry]], and [[Robert I]] mishandling the resulting crisis, insulting the pride, and worse, the [[Kestavo|ancient gods]] of the highland kingdom.

In [[Tyrwingha]], [[Elaine II]] rules uneasily. On the death of the great [[Cece I|Queen Cece I]], seven years ago, all expected the royal electors of [[Tyrwingha]], the [[Oracle of the Riven|Oracles of the Riven]], to elector her only surviving son, [[Robert I]], of the reigning [[House of Sewick]], as they had for a generation. Instead, they elected [[Elaine II]], a cousin of [[Robert I]] and a descendant of [[Cynan]] the great king of [[Tyrwingha]]. She is popular in [[Tyrwingha]], and not coincidentally, the current heir to the throne of [[Sembara]] should [[Robert I]] die without issue.

Rumors do spread about her resemblance to her famous great-great-grandmother, [[Elaine I]], who like her, was a queen of [[Tyrwingha]] before becoming queen of [[Sembara]] and whose reign was marred by great disputes over succession. Despite that, the land is peaceful, and the scars of the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] wars of two generations ago are healing, and mostly forgotten. 

The action begins just outside the market town of [[Cleenseau]].
