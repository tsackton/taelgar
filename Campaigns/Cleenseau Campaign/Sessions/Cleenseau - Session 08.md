## Narrative
The session begins around noon, after having spoken with [[Wymar Essford]] and [[Rinault Essford]] about their memories of town history. The party splits up:

* [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]] investigates the basement of Essford Manor. After some digged and cleaning with prestidigitation, he finds a large granite slab covering what appears to be a secret entrance to the underground ruined fort
* [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] investigates the garrison. Although there are no meaningful records, [[Walter of Cleenseau|Walter]] although a bit grumbly upon being awakened, warms to Robin's gentle insistence that Walter's knowledge will be extremely helpful, and ends up sharing several stories of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] and in particular the [[Recapture of Cleenseau (Third Hobgoblin War|recapture of Cleenseau]]. He won't let Robin leave until he promises to accompany Walter to Walter's favorite sweet shop
* [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] investigates the ruined fort south of the [[Enst]] but discovers little there
* [[Viepuck]] and [[Celyn]] investigate [[Tumbledown Farm]] and follow up on [[Cedric]] the missing pregnant transman. The eventually discover, with the help of [[Eliana]] that he was ill the previous night, and find signs he fell into the river (likely in some distress given the blood and vomit). Viepuck also finds evidence of a rat hole beneath [[Tumbledown Farm]] and sends [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] to investigate

The party regroups outside [[Auloutte]] as [[Gideon Thorne]], one of the main fishermen in [[Auloutte]] and the father-in-law of [[Beatrix Thorne|Beatrix]] has sounded the horns. There, they discover Cedric's dead and zombie-fied baby. Abundant caution prevents any additional harm, beyond the tragedy of Cedric and his unborn child's death.  In the meantime [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] investigates the rat hole, and finds a warren. One zombie-fied rat he manages to kill, and two others he avoids. He additionally finds an exit at a nearby house, neighbor to [[Beatrix Thorne|Beatrix]] and the [[Jon Thorne|Thorne's]]. Finally, he discovers that the rat warren exits into some buried basement, as well as a large, oddly constructed tunnel. While investigating this, the party discovers that one of the Thorne's was bitten by a rat a few days ago, but is getting better. Robin's investigation suggests a magical infection of some kind, which the teenager fought off.

That evening, the party dines, along with a crowd of well-wishers and worrying townsfolk, and [[The Crossroads Inn]]. While [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] entertains [[Rinault Essford|Lord Rinault]], [[Viepuck]] and [[Celyn]] discuss the past with [[Marigold Stonebridge]]. She shares some history of the inn, including its base as an underground railroad of sorts for humans fleeing hobgoblins. The next morning, the party descends into the tower. 

Each of the top floors of the tower seem to be trapped - but the traps are facing down and in, and so the party avoids them: a boulder trap and a holy water trap are most notable. The holy water trap is a ever filling trickle of holy water pouring out of a holy symbol of [[The Night Queen]], and three of the five stars of the symbol must be touched with holy water for the door to open.

Beyond the traps, in the main hall, are a group of giant centipedes, which are easily defeated after being calmed with Pipes of Beast Control found in [[Cleenseau - Session 03]]. The upper level of the manor contains little, save for a chest with a complex trap which was apparently never opened by the hobgoblins and after figuring out the trap, contained several magical items from a Ranger.  On returning to the main hall, a swarm of bones burst from one of the towers, which the party defeated, despite one of the skeletons being able to cast necromantic spells. 

The session ends as the party finds an entrance hall infested with ghouls.
