>[[Cleenseau]] and vicinity
>on Earth: November 12th, 2023

The session begins around noon, after having spoken with [[Wymar Essford]] and [[Rinault Essford]] about their memories of town history. The party splits up:

* [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]] investigates the basement of Essford Manor. After some digged and cleaning with prestidigitation, he finds a large granite slab covering what appears to be a secret entrance to the underground ruined fort
* [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] investigates the garrison. Although there are no meaningful records, [[Walter of Cleenseau|Walter]] although a bit grumbly upon being awakened, warms to Robin's gentle insistence that Walter's knowledge will be extremely helpful, and ends up sharing several stories of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] and in particular the [[Recapture of Cleenseau (Third Hobgoblin War|recapture of Cleenseau]]. He won't let Robin leave until he promises to accompany Walter to Walter's favorite sweet shop
* [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] investigates the ruined fort south of the [[Enst]] but discovers little there
* [[Viepuck]] and [[Celyn]] investigate [[Tumbledown Farm]] and follow up on [[Cedric]] the missing pregnant transman. The eventually discover, with the help of [[Eliana]] that he was ill the previous night, and find signs he fell into the river (likely in some distress given the blood and vomit). Viepuck also finds evidence of a rat hole beneath [[Tumbledown Farm]] and sends [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] to investigate

The party regroups outside [[Aulout]] as [[Gideon Thorne]], one of the main fishermen in [[Aulout]] and the father-in-law of [[Beatrix Thorne|Beatrix]] has sounded the horns. There, they discover Cedric's dead and zombie-fied baby. Abundant caution prevents any additional harm, beyond the tragedy of Cedric and his unborn child's death.  In the meantime [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] investigates the rat hole, and finds a warren. One zombie-fied rat he manages to kill, and two others he avoids. He additionally finds an exit at the [[Gracien house]], neighbor to [[Beatrix Thorne|Beatrix]] and the [[Jon Thorne|Thorne's]]. Finally, he discovers that the rat warren exits into some buried basement, as well as a large, oddly constructed tunnel. While investigating this, the party discovers that one of the Thorne's was bitten by a rat a few days ago, but is getting better. Robin's investigation suggests a magical infection of some kind, which the teenager fought off.

That evening, the party dines, along with a crowd of well-wishers and worrying townsfolk, and [[The Crossroads Inn]]. While [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] entertains [[Rinault Essford|Lord Rinault]], [[Viepuck]] and [[Celyn]] discuss the past with [[Marigold Stonebridge]]. She shares some history of the inn, including its base as an underground railroad of sorts for humans fleeing hobgoblins. The next morning, the party descends into the tower.
