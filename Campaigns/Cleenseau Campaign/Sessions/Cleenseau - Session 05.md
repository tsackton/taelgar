%% RAW NOTES: Fought Ogre (Wakog). Various plans and such. Defeated with suprisingly little loss of life.

At some point I will want to thank Robin for the horn idea.  That patched the infiltration plan perfectly since bringing in new prisoners was no longer an option.   
  
We’ve got 60 underfed and undersupplied people, some horses, some supplies, and a dozen or more bodies and assorted other remains to bring back?  I assume we’ll be walking and using the horses to transport the dead, but that it will take a bit longer.  Unless we send a detachment back faster with the dead to be properly cared for, or Robyn rides back fast to send someone out with wagons to meet us.  Largely details dont need hard-managing and can happen in the background, but the detail of sending back a rider with news might matter.   
  
Do the other skirmisher groups find any more patrols?  
  
Balthazar - I will happily go over various patron stuff, history of contact if asked, do a mind probe when I have a chance to rest and regain some of those to establish contact, etc etc.  I dont know how he would make a pact if interested, but I suspect some private-talk with Es’Tiasilos, then Es’Tiasilos going off, eating a chicken egg or such and regurgitating it several days later as something weird.  At that point he probably wanders off with a different assignment?  I would buy him some equipment if he pact-bonds (armor, supplies, etc, let me know how much gold gets spent) and introduce him to some halfling caravans to travel with (though probably in spring?).   I think available pacts would be tome, chain or amulet, depending on whether he wants knowledge, friends, or to be helpful.   
  
I expect this would then become the new way warlocks get propagated - you go through some kind of major life threatening trauma, someone of this order helps, and if you have no one to go back to you can be a warlock and go off and study the world.%%
