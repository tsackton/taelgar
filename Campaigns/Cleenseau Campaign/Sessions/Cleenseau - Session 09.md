### Scene Notes
A few notable events:
* During the first fight with shadows, Robin's lantern exploded with daylight which massively hindered the shadows
* Sent [[Estiasilos|Es*tiasilos]] to scout rat passages, discover they connected from the fort to [[Tumbledown Farm]]
* Rushed exploration of the rest before daylight faded; shadows weakened the party a lot, needing a short rest
* Found a halfling ghost who hated hobgoblins but seemed to respond to Estalios speaking in halfling; discovered a locket in a secret niche
* Killed huge zombie with Robin-dodge (so it couldn't hit) plus fire from above
* Found halfling skeleton with [[Silverthorn]]
* Found main trap room - a big room with a dimension door portal at one side and black ooze pit with small pillars blocking access. Eventually magically created ice on the tops of each of the pillars to allow everyone to jump along a pattern to get across
