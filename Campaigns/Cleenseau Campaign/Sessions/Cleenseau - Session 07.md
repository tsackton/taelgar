Organization and research
Duncan Rivers and his missing fey
Zombie fight

About an hour and a half after sunrise, Robin went to the Temple of the Warlord (the large temple in the stone plaza, on the map), and shortly after Béatrix came seeking him. They left the temple and had a quiet conversation around the side of the temple nearest the manor, and then arrived at Margaret Ashford's midwifery about thirty minutes later. Béatrix was inside for about 10 minutes before the zombie attack. In the aftermath of the attack, you immediately started quizzing Maragret about other pregnant women or recent births in town. She tells you about the following:

  

* 8 pregnant women and 1 pregnant trans man she knows of, most in the North Close and South Close, but one in Underhill and one in the Garrison Quarter

* 6 infants she knows of, split between the North Close and South Close

* one women who died recently (a week or so ago) in childbirth, who also lost the baby, in Underhill

* one infant who died recently (almost 3 weeks ago) of a wracking cough/fever, in the North Close

* 4 other midwives she knows, two based in the South Close and one in the Garrison Quarter, and one in Underhill

* an apothecary, Alain LeBouillon, who sometimes helps with brews and remedies for morning sickness and other ailments of pregnancy, with a shop in the South Close

  

Margaret also reminds you that there is a small dwarven and small halfling community in town, but she has no real insight into their birth customs or even if there are any pregnancies amongst them.  

  

With this information, Maragret leads Robin, Viepuck, and Celyn on a almost-jog through the city, checking in on as many of the young infants and pregnant people as you can. All 8 of the pregnant women are accounted for, but the trans man (Cedric) is missing. He lives at 'Tumbledown Farm' (see below, but note at the time the party is initially asking after him you wouldn't know about Oudine). Maragret believes that the other father is a soldier but she isn't sure. Five of the six infants are accounted for as well (meaning you are able to visually inspect the infant to confirm it isn't sick/a monster/etc and speak to at least one caregiver, either a parent, grandparent, or sibling). One of the six infants - who lives in the North Close - is unaccounted for, although his three older sisters say their father took him to the smith's to get a cookpot repaired. There is no sign of the mother. This takes a bit longer than an hour.

  

In the meantime, Izgil draws sketches of the five dead adults (3 adults, plus the mother - the baby was never recognizable). The four people are:

  

* Emmeline Duval, a baker, particularly known for her "miracle of the bridge" festival fried dough. Her loss will be a blow to the culinary scene in town.Seraphine Harper

* Seraphine Harper, a farmer's wife, who leaves behind a large family of eight children.

* Henry Blackwell, a blacksmith's apprentice. His sweetheart, Gaston Tremaine, a young farmer, was the one who escaped due to the party's warning and is particularly distraught

* Oudine, a washerwoman from Underhill, was the woman with the baby. Some of the people think she has had several children with various different men, and lives at 'Tumbledown Farm', which is not actually a farm but a large and somewhat run down house nearby where several poorer townsfolk live three or more to a room

  

Nothing about them immediately suggests a relationship or anything other than bad luck, but you can certainly investigate further.

  

So an hour or so before midday, the party is back together by Margaret's midwifery and shares the information above. So here is the question -- what are you doing next? Numerous things suggest themselves...
