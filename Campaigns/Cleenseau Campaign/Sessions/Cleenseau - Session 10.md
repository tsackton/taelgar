>7 Robert I / DR 1720
>[[Cleenseau]] and vicinity
>on Earth: January 7th, 2024

### Summary and Major Events

* Beneath a ruined fort on the south bank of the Enst, the party defeats a wight and his minions, and breaks a green gem that appears to be spreading a disease that creates zombies
* The party rides from the ruined fort to the Cleenseau Bridge, and aids the remnants of the [[Lord's Guard of Cleenseau]] in their fight against a dozen zombies
* The party meets with [[Erick Murtha]] and [[Warin the Woodsman]], and plans a council for the next day to discuss greater goings on in the region

### Rumors and Information
* The green gem beneath Cleenseau appeared to be spreading a white mist that, when it contacted a living creature, gave them a plague that would create zombies. This plague seemed to vanish entirely when the gem was smashed by the power of the Wanderer, channeled through [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]]
* The wight appears to have been a (long dead) hobgoblin, wearing an insignia:
      ![[avatus-symbol-sketch.png|120]]

### Raw Scenes
Raw notes and notable scenes:

* Robin taking attack after attack after attack from the wight, defending well 
* Moonbeam from Izgil blocking movement, and making the wight struggle to get attacks in
* The wight hitting, and almost killing, Celyn with a life-drain attack
* Celyn finding the secret door in the wight's fort - contained a bunch of treasure from hundreds of years ago
* Greymalkin appearing, and the party defeating the last group of zombies, rescuing the Lord's Guard, by using powerful new abilities: Robin's stead, Celyn's massive number of misty steps, Viepuck's increased damage from Eldritch Blast, and Igzil's moonburst.
