### Summary and Major Events

* Beneath a ruined fort on the south bank of the Enst, the party defeats a wight and his minions, and breaks a green gem that appears to be spreading a disease that creates zombies
* The party rides from the ruined fort to the Cleenseau Bridge, and aids the remnants of the [[Lord's Guard of Cleenseau]] in their fight against a dozen zombies
* The party meets with [[Erick Murtha]] and [[Warin the Woodsman]], and plans a council for the next day to discuss greater goings on in the region

### Rumors and Information
* The green gem beneath Cleenseau appeared to be spreading a white mist that, when it contacted a living creature, gave them a plague that would create zombies. This plague seemed to vanish entirely when the gem was smashed by the power of the Wanderer, channeled through [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]]
* The wight appears to have been a (long dead) hobgoblin, wearing an insignia:
