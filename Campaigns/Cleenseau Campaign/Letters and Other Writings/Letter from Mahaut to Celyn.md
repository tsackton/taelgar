>Charlotte has brought news of you, and we all rejoiced to hear you have survived - perhaps even helped to lessen - the recent troubles. As I am sure Charlotte has told you, things here are steady as always. Antonin broke her heart soon after you left, but Hugh has been good to her, and is, I think a better match. Charlotte and Antonin are too alike in some ways to really be together. Alys and Aldi and Josse send their greetings, and Alys says to say she misses her favorite dicing companion.

>I think we will take your advice, and turn back south for the spring. Perhaps we will even head towards the Plataca Hills. I've been wanting to see a new place, and maybe this is the year to be far away from Sembara.

>The rising of the dead took us all for a shock, I will admit, as I am sure you can imagine. We saw little of it, but we are encamped only three days ride from Eskbridge, and a stately woman in green and silver riding an elk came through, with a flock of Tyrwinghans behind her. Going to fight the skeletons gathered at Eskbridge, I guess. She was glorious, in her way, and Antonin almost joined with her to fight the skeletons. I talked him out of it, but perhaps I shouldn't have. I hear she is still camped with five hundred Tyrwinghans on the south banks of the Enst, watching the road from Sembara.

>There are rumors of strange things in the Mostreve Hills, that I wanted to pass on because I know you are from there. There are reports of large elk wandering between the stones, and young men and women disappearing. I do not know what to make of it but thought you should know.
