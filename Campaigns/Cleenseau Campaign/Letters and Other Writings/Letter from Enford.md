# Letter from Captain Rochefort to Captain Rosfeld
_Received in [[Cleenseau]], February 7th_

Captain Rosfeld:

I write to you to share the news from Enford, and the reason for my writing is most strange and I greatly desire an explanation, if one can be provided. 

Yesterday, in the aftermath of our battles (of which more, below), a strange creature emerged from hearth, a multi-tentacled octopus shimmering in purple and stranger colors. I was terrified, I must say. It sprayed some - thankfully harmless - black goo all over my secretary, and before I could react, drew, on the table, the words IDA CLEENSEAU NEWS NOW. And then it turned into a dog, licked my hand in a friendly way, and ran off!

I beg an explanation! How you been dabbling in sorcery or worse? It did not seem devilish although I can’t say I’ve even seen a dog that smelled of onions and strawberries! A strange and unsettling combination, but not an evil one. 

But I digress. All is as well as can be in Enford, although the settlement is in shambles. You can read my report below, to the Colonel. But I should explain how we came to be here. 

Some days ago, after marching north, only to be ordered south, we were ordered north again. The battle at Ainwick was said to be going 
poorly, although what four garrisons and a company could do to assist 3000 soldiers I could not fathom. And so I, and many of the soldiers of the Enford, River, North Fork, and South Fork garrisons, and the First Company, lately stationed in Enford, refused to turn from our path. Colonel Lecleric turned a blind eye, and swore to stay with the South Watch, and get to the bottom of these confusing orders. 

We marched as fast as we could south, and reached Enford on January 25th. 

Captain Pierre Rochefort, lately of the North Fork Garrison
In Enford, January 29th, 7 Robert I

And the enclosed copy of a letter to Colonel Lecleric:

>I report as agreed on the situation in Enford, and hope your project goes well. The settlement is in shambles, although the loss of life is not as drastic we feared. We found the settlement abandoned, and overrun with the risen dead. The most deadly were two dozen creatures of dusty rotting flesh, arisen from some dark grave. Their touch bestowed a wicked curse, and we lost a hundred good soldiers. We had a devil of a time killing them, until we hit upon fire, which turned the tide. But sadly much of the settlement will have to be rebuilt.

>We learned that much of the population had fled to a number of fortified manors nearby. It seems the undead were drawn to large groups of living, and dispersing left the dusty ones rambling through the empty town. This was not without cost, and as I said, the clearing of them from Enford was a tragic victory.

>But order is restored, and the rebuilding begins.

>We await further instructions as to our fate.
