# Robin's Miracle of Smiting

>[!Info]- This is [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin's]] reflections on the smiting of the skeleton. Only read it if Robin has revealed it in game
> Robin still thinks often about how it felt. He had been fighting on and off, chasing the zombies, for an hour by then. But the calvary had held up well, and he was confident, until that thing slithered into the water.  
> 
> That shook him - it meant they couldn’t hold the bridge - and if it got into Cleenseau the havoc it would wreck…  
> 
> The first blow was his skill - a well placed smash with his hammer, humming with his faith. He could feel the bones of that thing shatter, as the divine blessing flowed through him, illuminating the skeletal monster in a warm glow, the flickering light of homely hearth, it seemed.  
>   
> The second blow was faith. The thing slithered under the bridge, out of his reach, still glowing, but too far away. A sense of calm came over him, and Robin felt a presence, far away, hidden behind a misty wall, waiting it seemed, for an invitation. Time slowed. He opened his heart and soul, took a breath, and gave himself wholly to this presence, this god, who he had always felt close to since childhood. And then he leapt off the bridge.  
>   
> He felt the magic flowing through him like a a dusty road leading over the horizon, the clink of a coin in a beggar’s cup, the taste of a simple but hearty stew shared with strangers, the warmth of a welcoming campfire, the musty scent of a well worn saddle. It was calm, and fast, and he saw the water part beneath him and his hammer moved and the bones of the skeleton were shattering into pieces and he was jumping back to the bridge.  
>   
> The third blow was fate. The aftershocks of that presence reverberated through him, and he barely saw what was happening as his hammer swung a third time, guided by the aftershocks of the presence, cracking the skeletal bones again, as the beast collapsed.  
>   
> Skeletons arose from the wreckage, and the battle continued, and the presence faded away, behind the veil. But Robin still thinks of how it felt, when that power moved through him.
