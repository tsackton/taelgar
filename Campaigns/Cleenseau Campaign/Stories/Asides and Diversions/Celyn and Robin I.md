So: while the operation to extract Lady Debrune and her fey associate from genteel imprisonment went off entirely without a hitch, Celyn returns from getting them to their next hiding place looking deeply unsettled, enough so that it actually shows through his usual happy-go-lucky manner.  Any expression of concern from Robin gets waved off, a bit apologetically, with a, “Not here, also not enough time to explain” and an earnest, “I *need* to tell you though, I won’t forget.”
  
Celyn is still at least slightly oblique about talking about this, at least partly because he’s still disconcerted by it - not upset, just unnerved.  He refers to the fey as “The lady’s companion” and says that he “is from a small kingdom wedged between home and this part of Sembara”, rather than specifying the name of the place in the Feywild.  “Someone from Twilight’s Grace asked his lord to send someone to keep an eye on me.  Specifically.”

He adds, “... which means there may not be any fey who aren’t terrible living here who might be treated with after all....” in a tone that’s very much that it’s something that he just thought of, not what was bothering him before, but hey, he can add it to the list of things he dislikes.

But back to the actual topic of his stress, he continues, very quietly, “Someone in the *Court*  made a _diplomatic request_ to send someone _alone into enemy territory_ to keep an eye on me and make sure I went to Cleenseau before I even did anything particularly interesting.  I am a *farm boy* from *Clawyn*, which basically nobody’s *heard of* but *wine merchants*, and someone in the *Court* divined something about *me*.”

He leans on Robin. “Fate feels very heavy today.”

(Mostly what Celyn wants is to lean on Robin, who is the most reliable and comforting stable point in his reality, while he gently has a perfectly sensible medieval peasant’s gentle freakout about having obtained Substantial Attention from the royalty he actually has some amount of fealty to.)
