%% Approximately summer 1715 %%
Celyn had been two months at the temple in Ruthin when he brought forth light.  It had been a strange sensation, a burning surge of ... something ... and now his inkpot was glowing.  Not knowing what to do about it, he picked up the pot and brought it to Eirian.  

Eirian’s expression was serious as she studied it and then returned it to him.  “What were you doing when it happened?” she asked.  

“I was working at copying over the recipe for the formula that helps deepen my voice into a man’s,” he said immediately, though with the embarrassing and reassuring crack in his voice that proved that it was working.  She nodded.  “And that means a great deal to you, obviously.”  She tapped the inkpot.  “You are developing the ability to be a gateway for the Wyrdling’s power.”  

“Oh,” said Celyn.  “Okay.”  Then he said, “What do I need to know?”  

“Holding a passage for a god is not a small thing,” she said, slowly.  “And you are young for it.  It is likely people will come to find you a little uncanny—”  

He shrugged.  “I’m used to that, though.”  

“I suppose you are a Mostreve boy with the fey touch about you,” she agreed.  “But it will be different.”  

“Okay.”  

“And it is not certain, but some of the Wyrdling’s chosen become,” she looked for a judicious word, “unstable, at least at times. If you have any tendency that way, it would be good for you to understand yourself well, so that you know what might aggravate it.”  

“When people think I’m a girl,” he said immediately.  And added, “I got very ... difficult.  In ... destructive ways.”  

She nodded slowly.  “Remember that.”
