Celyn was dicing with Alys again.  Just the two of them, this time; they were between villages and nobody wanted to get between Celyn’s occasional runs of luck and Alys’s drive to win.  

Once it seemed most everyone else had gone off to their own entertainments, she paused, pouring the dice back and forth between her hands, and peered at him.  

“Mm?”  

“Can I ask you a prying question?”  

“Sure?”  Celyn peered at her owlishly.  He had more or less resolved his thoughts about her to a warm fuzzy spot, rather than anything more intense.  

“Why don’t you join the acrobats?  You can do the moves.  Or do sleight of hand, or something?  You’re always there to fill in in practice but you never seem to want to do more.”  

He shrugged.  “I’m not a performer.  And just because I can do the moves doesn’t mean I can do a whole show.”  

“Well, why not?”  

“I don’t always do well when I get to breathing hard.”  He shrugged again and gestured for her to roll the dice.  

“What, asthma?  I hadn’t noticed.”  

“No, my bindings get in the way of good deep breaths.  So if I have to keep going a long time working hard it’s— I wouldn’t want other people depending on me for safety, you know?”  

She threw the dice, not paying much attention to them. “Bindings?”  

“You like curves.  I like not having them.”  He scooped the dice up.  “Seven, you win that round.”  

“You’re— I had no idea.”  

“I swear by the Wyrdling for a reason,” he said with a laugh.  

“I’d ask why you hide it but you obviously don’t, you just answered me like that.”  Alys was frowning slightly, wholly distracted from the game.  

“I don’t like thinking about it.  I have places I talk around it.  I have places I don’t know how to talk about it.  But if I focus too much on it I feel ... more out of season with myself. And that goes bad places I would rather not be. So I don’t.  But you asked, and that’s the reason, so it was relevant.”  

“I guess that makes sense.”  

Celyn shook the dice. “My throw.”
