This website is the campaign bible for the [[Cleenseau Campaign]], a D&D game set in the world of Taelgar, a magical shared world developed by my brother and I. 

Been here before? Check out the [[Index of Changes]].

Please note that some information here is intended to be for certain players only. That information will be in a spoiler warning block, like so:

>[!INFO]- Delwaths's Background (For Mike's Eyes Only)
> Some secret information about Delwath.

When you see this, please don't expand the spoiler block unless you are the target player.

You most likely want to start with the [[Cleenseau Campaign - Index of NPCs|NPCs]], session notes, and other information about the [[Cleenseau Campaign]]. Then you might want to read about [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]], two of the major realms. Or you might want to read about the religion of [[Mos Numena]] or just explore the [[Gazetteer]]. 

For more information about mechanics and other world background for players specifically, see the [[Player's Guide]] or the [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Mechanics/House Rules]].
