![[shield-of-false-life.png|right|320]]A slightly battered Drankorian shield with an ever shifting set of sigils on its face, found in [[Wakog's Camp]]. 

#### Mechanics
The face of the shield never seems to show the same sigil twice, shifting between various symbols and abstractions. The bearer may choose what the face of the shield shows, with a thought.

In addition, once per day, the first time the bearer takes damage, the shield grants the bearer 8 temporary hit points.
