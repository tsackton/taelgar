![[shield-of-false-life.png|right|320]]A slightly battered Drankorian shield with an ever shifting set of sigils on its face, found in [[Wakog's Camp]]. 

### Mechanics
The face of the shield never seems to show the same sigil twice, shifting between various symbols and abstractions. The bearer may choose what the face of the shield shows, with a thought.

In addition the first time the bearer takes damage each day, the shield grants the bearer 8 Temporary Hit Points. These Hit Points are granted after the damage is taken.
