# Ring of Wounding

![[ring-of-wounding.png|right|420]]A band of solid blackness that is ring-shaped, but appears to absorb all light and is not clearly made of any material at all. Deeply necromantic, but not extremely powerful. Something about it makes you nervous about trying to use it. Taken from a skeleton that attacked the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]] with necromantic magic beneath [[Essford Manor]].

### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_
This ring grants the wearer the ability to cast _Inflict Wounds_ three times each day, and _Chill Touch_ at will. While attuned to this ring, the wearer's skin always feels cold to the touch. Anyone who dies while wearing this ring arises as a skeleton the next midnight.
