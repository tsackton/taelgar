![[pipes-of-insect-control.png|right|420]]A set of pan pipes, crudely made and lashed together with twine. Each of the four pipes plays a different note.  Originally of suspected fey make, and found in the [[Cleenseau Wood]] by some bandits. Later found in the bandit lair by the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]].
