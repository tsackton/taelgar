![[pipes-of-insect-control.png|right|420]]A set of pan pipes, crudely made and lashed together with twine. Each of the four pipes plays a different note.  Originally of suspected fey make, and found in the [[Cleenseau Wood]] by some bandits. Later found in the bandit lair by the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]].

### Mechanics
This rough set of pan pipes can be used to control an insect. As a Magic action, target one insect (or swarm of insects) within 100 feet that can hear the pipes being played. The insect must make a **DC 13** Charisma Saving Throw. If the insect is Charmed by the pipes, it automatically fails this Saving Throw. On a failure, you can apply one of the following effects to the beast:

**Enrage**. This gives the beast 5 Temporary Hit Points and enrages it. For the next hour it will attack any creature it sees on sight.  
**Calm**. This acts as the _Calm Emotions_ spell but with a duration of 4 hours.  
**Frighten**. This causes the beast to be Frightened of you for as long as you continue to play the pipes (no action required), for up to 10 minutes.  
**Nest**. This calms the beast and causes it to tunnel and burrow and make a nest for the next 4 hours.

If a single insect that is not Immune to the Charmed condition is subjected to the **Calm** effect three times each day, for five consecutive days, the insect is Charmed by the pipes. Only a single insect can be charmed by the pipes at one time.

These pipes have 3 changes, which reset each dawn.
