Total available gold: 595 - 895
## Magical and Unusual Items
#### From the Bandit Lair

- A strangely unchipped ceramic ewer, decorated with Drankorian words for milk, water, beer, wine, honey, vinegar, tea and oil in stylized patterns running up and down the sides. It holds about a quart of liquid and sounds full of water sloshing around despite being empty. ([Ewer of Liquid on D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/6683137-ewer-of-liquid))
#### From the Ruined Hobgoblin Fort

- A smooth granite ring with a faint line of blue, from the Ranger chest. ([Ring of Water Walking on D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4737-ring-of-water-walking)) 
- Four keys to a magic chest of dark brown wood, magical. Opening the chest requires inserting each key into the correct lock (fox, badger, eagle, or boar) and the chest itself
- A band of solid blackness that is ring-shaped, but appears to absorb all light and is not clearly made of any material at all. Deeply necromantic, but not extremely powerful. It grants the wearer the ability to cast inflict wounds three times a day and chill touch at will. It requires attunement, and something about it makes you nervous about trying to use it.
## Jewelry
* Three golden chains, that jewelry could be strung on, relatively thick and heavy, 16" - 18" long (value: 25 - 30 gp each)
## Gemstones
- two small uncut pieces of amber (value: 20 - 25 gp, could double with proper cutting)
- a beautiful but tiny opal (value: 50 - 70 gp)
- a large but tarnished pearl (value: 60 - 80 gp)
- a exquisitely cut piece of turquoise with a silver setting (probably once part of a ring) (value: 30 - 40 gp, could triple if made into a finished ring)
## Miscellany
- A well-worked and elaborate saddle with gold and silver paneling and small amethysts (value: 120 - 200 gp)
## Coin

- 1000 silver Dwarven coins (worth 100 gp, common trade coin), found in the ruined fort on the south bank of the Enst
- 100 unfamiliar gold coins with a stylized river on both sides (work 75 gp by weight of gold, could be worth more to the right buyer), found in the ruined fort on the south bank of the Enst
- 300 unfamiliar and differently sized silver coins with a bloody claw on the back and a variety of numbers (1, 5, 10) stamped on the front, which seem to correlate with the size (worth 45 gp by weight, could be worth more to the right buyer), found in the ruined fort on the south bank of the Enst
## Given Away or Sold

- 50 heavy gold coins, from the reign of Derrick III, found in the bandit lair (given to Rosalind)    
- Two finely cut rubies, each the size of a pinky nail, worth 500 gp each, found in the bandit lair (given to Rosalind)
