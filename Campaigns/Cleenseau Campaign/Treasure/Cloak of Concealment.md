![[ranger-cloak-of-concealment.png|right|320]]A finely made green and white cloak found in a Ranger’s chest in the ruined hobgoblin fort under [[Cleenseau]]. Likely dates from the early 1600s.

### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_
While you are attuned to and wearing this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have Disadvantage, and you have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
