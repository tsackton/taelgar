![[lantern-of-the-bright-hearth.png|right|400]]A small lantern carried by [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]]. It gives off a perpetual warm glow that reminds one of home and pleasant things. This lantern was originally forged by [[Aelirios Sunblade]] as a gift for [[Cedric Cyfenwid]]. 

> [!INFO]- Finding the Lantern (For Dan's Eyes Only)
> Robin is out on a patrol with the Rangers, and he awakes in the middle of the night in camp. Standing up, under the full moon, he smells the scent of spring growth and fresh cool rain wafting from the top of the hill. He follows the scent. At the top of the hill, amongst the trees with new green leaves he sees, blowing on the wind, dozens of golden leaves. The leaves land in a perfect circle and in the middle of the circle he sees a pool of white light sparkling and flowing along the ground like a mist. Out of the mist two hands form, and rise from the mist in the center of the circle of golden leaves. The hands hold out a softly glowing pebble, smooth and round. 
> 
> Robin approaches, sits outside the circle, and asks, "Who are you?"
> 
> Nothing happens at first. Time seems to pass very slowly, or the scent of the air distracts you from the time passing, or something. Either way, Robin is surprised to notice the moon is setting and apparently hours have passed when a male large elk with out-of-season antlers comes out of the forest and walks up to him and gently and almostly lovingly pushes Robin towards the hands
> 
> Robin gives the elk a scritch, and then walks into the circle following its nudge.
> 
> As Robin crosses the circle of leaves he feels a sense of deja vu, like he has seen these leaves before. For a moment, the setting moon is replaced by the setting sun, and the entire sky is covered with crimson and pink clouds. Then the moon returns, and as he picks up the pebble from the hands.
> 
>  As he touches the pebble it becomes insubstantial for a moment. Time seems to freeze and he feels in his mind a question -- Will you Help? 
>  
>  He doesn't really know what is asking for his help, beyond the feeling of evening quiet, the setting sun, the elk, the pebbles. It feels fey to him, but it also feels infinite and vast, and like a Great Power. But he also senses sincerity from the question, and can feel a palpable sense of the hands -- he sees a series of visions:
>  
> * A man in shining armor, the sigil of the Wyrdling on this armor, riding a white horse into battle
> * the same man, bloodied, standing in a battlefield of dead hobgoblins and humans, weeping 
> * the same man again, laying his hands on an elderly woman, and her wounds closing
>
>He gets the sense that this man, whoever he was, wants him to say yes.
>
>Robin answers: "Yes" and as he takes the pebble it transforms into a lantern, the hands vanish, and the circle drifts away in the rising sun. As Robin walks back to the patrol camp, he feels for a moment this is all a dream. But the lantern is real in his hand

### Mechanics
At your mental command, this lantern glows with a faint amber light, illuminating an area of 30' with dim light. This light is magical, and for the purposes of _darkness_ and similar spells, treated as if it was created by the _continual flame_ spell. The light of the lantern is glamoured to enhance and emphasize what is already there, rather than conceal and mislead. If the lantern is visible, those within its glow will be receptive to your true statements: you gain advantage on Persuasion checks as long as you speak the truth. But beware if you do not speak the truth: your lies will be shown for what they are while you are within the light of the lantern and you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks if you lie.

The light of the lantern brings peace and easy sleep, and those resting in its light find even the hardest ground as if it was a soft bed. You and any companions sleeping in the light may sleep in armor without suffering any consequences.

If attuned to the lantern, it will return whole to you each twilight, should it be lost or misplaced. Legend says if you are slain, the lantern will remain somewhere near where you died, but never hidden or buried, and if removed will return to that spot at the next twilight, as a memorial, until a worthy successor, aligned with the lantern's ethos, feels compelled to take up the lantern as a new bearer.

If you are within 60 feet of it, you can command it to emanate light equivalent to that of the [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light) or [Daylight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619083-daylight) spell (your choice). Once used, the Daylight effect can’t be used again until the next dawn.

You can issue another command as a [Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.


%% Old notes from emails

_You will take this. It is not presented as a gift, Rather, it is yours, this simply is. This world can be harsh, and you may find that your inclinations to be kind are sorely tested. If you find yourself forgetting who you are, may this light remind you."_   

**Lantern of the Bright Hearth**
A small crystal lantern about the size of a fist

When the bearer wills (Free Action), it glows with a soft amber light and illuminates the area around for a distance of 30'. In the presence of magical darkness, it will maintain illumination around it for a distance of 15'.

If analyzed, the lantern is imbued with fey magic and has a glamour, but the glamour is specifically meant to emphasize what already is rather then to obscure or mislead. If the lantern is visible and the bearer is speaking truthfully, people within its light will have a sense that the bearer is trustworthy and earnest (not intended to be a tangible die bonus to persuade or anything, but people would be unlikely to suspect the bearer of lying).  

Those resting within its light will be reminded of pleasant things and hopeful times past, and will find that sleep comes easily.  

If lost or destroyed, the lantern will return whole to its bearer at the next twilight. If the bearer is slain, the lantern will remain somewhere near where its bearer died, but in the open (if the bearer was slain in cave, for instance, it would appear near the mouth of the cave), and if removed will return to that spot at the next twilight. If someone passes by who aligns with the lantern's ethos, they may feel compelled to take up the lantern and will then become its new bearer.
