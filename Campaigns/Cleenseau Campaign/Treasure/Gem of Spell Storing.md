![[gem-of-spell-storing.png|right|400]]This swirling gem appears to contain a constantly swirling light, and emits a very faint red glow. It was taken from [[Areschera]] after her death in [[Veltor]].

### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_
The gem can hold up to 3 levels of spells, and you can cast any of the spells stored in the ring as if they were known spells to you, and without using a spell slot. You use your spellcasting ability for casting these spells. Casting a spell from the gem dissipates it. You can store a spell in the gem by casting it, or alternatively by:

* Counterspelling the spell

* If you are the only target of the spell, and you make your saving throw to resist it, you can use your reaction to store the spell by passing a DC 12 + level of spell arcana check
