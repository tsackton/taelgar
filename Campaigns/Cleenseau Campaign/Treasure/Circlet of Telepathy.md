![[circlet-of-telepathy.png|right|420]]A golden circlet, found split across two pieces of enchanted armor, mysteriously rejoined. Found in the abandoned hobgoblin fort beneath Cleenseau.

### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_

While wearing and attuned to this circlet you gain the following abilities:

**Telepathy**: You can, at will, expend an action to establish a telepathic link with anyone you can see or otherwise clearly identify within 30 feet. Once this link is established it lasts until either you voluntarily end it, you become unconscious, or asleep, or you use another feature of the circlet. You may only establish a single telepathic link at a time. Once you have established a telepathic link, you may communicate with your target, and they with you, as if you were speaking. You must share a common language. If the target does not wish to hear your voice, they can, as an action, try to block you by making a Wisdom saving throw against **DC 15**. Once blocked, you cannot communicate with someone for 24 hours.

**Detect Thoughts** You can, at will, expend an action to attempt to probe someone’s surface thoughts within 30’ of you. The target makes a Wisdom save against **DC 15**. If they succeed, you are unable to read their thoughts for 24 hours. If they fail, you can read their surface thoughts until you either break concentration or attempt to probe deeper. While probing someone’s surface thoughts they are unaware that you are probing them. If you wish, you can try to probe deeper. Once you are probing deeper, the following occurs:

- the target knows their mind is being probed
- you can read one aspect of their deeper emotional state and goals and hidden thoughts
- after each attempt to probe deeper, the target may repeat the **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw

On a success, you are expelled from their mind and unable to read their thoughts for 24 hours. On a failure, you may either return to reading their surface thoughts or probe another aspect of their goals and hidden thoughts.

If a target leaves your line of sight, or travels more than 30’ from you, they may repeat the **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw each minute. On a failure, you continue to be able to read their thoughts. On a success, you are expelled from their mind and unable to read their thoughts for 24 hours.

**Suggestion**. Once per day, while reading a target’s thoughts, you can implant a suggestion in the target’s mind. This is an action, but this does not require words and does not require verbal communication, and has no material component (it works even if you are unable to share a language with the target, or don’t want to speak out loud). The target gets a **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw. On a success, they are aware of the suggestion and your detect thoughts ends, and they are immune for the next 24 hours. On a failure, the detect thoughts ends and the suggestion grows in their mind, as per the _Suggestion_ spell. The target follows the suggestion for the best of their ability for 8 hours.
