![[silverthorn.png|right|300]]A slim rapier, gleaming but always a bit hard to see. Found on a dead halfling beneath [[Cleenseau]]. This was originally the possession of [[Rose Stonebridge]], a halfling who lived in Cleenseau in the 1400s. 

According to [[Marigold Stonebridge]], Rose was one of the leaders of a resistance to hobgoblin occupation during the [[Dominion of Avatus]]. The matching sheath was given to [[Celyn]] by Marigold, and while not exactly magical, it appears to be exceptional at concealment, and with barely any effort the rapier can vanish into one's cloak.

#### Mechanics
This rapier shimmers with sparkles along the blade and has an elaborate hilt. It seems to always gleam, and never gets dirty. By whispering a command word, the sword can become invisible until it is used in combat. When used to attack a creature while the wielder is unseen, a 19 or 20 counts as a critical hit.

Once per day, the _Invisibility_ spell can be cast from the sword, targeting the wielder only.
