![[silverthorn.png|right|300]]A slim rapier, gleaming but always a bit hard to see. Found on a dead halfling beneath [[Cleenseau]]. This was originally the possession of [[Rose Stonebridge]], a halfling who lived in Cleenseau in the 1400s. 

According to [[Marigold Stonebridge]], Rose was one of the leaders of a resistance to hobgoblin occupation during the [[Dominion of Avatus]]. The matching sheath was given to [[Celyn]] by Marigold, and while not exactly magical, it appears to be exceptional at concealment, and with barely any effort the rapier can vanish into one's cloak.
