![[hammer-of-viligance.jpg|right|320]]A finely crafted silver and steel with blue wrappings. It seems to anticipate danger. It was found in a secret room in the underground hobgoblin fort beneath [[Cleenseau]] and appears to be war loot from an unknown Sembaran hero, from several hundred years ago.
