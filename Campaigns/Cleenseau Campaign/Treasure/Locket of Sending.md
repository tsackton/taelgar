# Locket of Sending
A paired pendant (one of two) used as a focus for limited distance communication/locating effects in the Cleenseau Campaign. The Baroness's described pendant sketch (by [[Rene d'Aslain]]) was produced during a ruse; interference claims referenced its being part of a set.

(Details to expand: properties, activation, second locket whereabouts.)
