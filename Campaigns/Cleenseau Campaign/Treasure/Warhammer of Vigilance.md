![[hammer-of-viligance.jpg|right|320]]A finely crafted silver and steel with blue wrappings. It seems to anticipate danger. It was found in a secret room in the underground hobgoblin fort beneath [[Cleenseau]] and appears to be war loot from an unknown Sembaran hero, from several hundred years ago.

### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_
This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person and you are attuned to it, you have advantage on Initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can’t be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. You (but not your companions) are magically awakened in any situation where you would need to roll Initiative.

Additionally, by circling you hammer in a ritual that takes 10 minutes around an area no larger than a 20’ cube, you can create a ward that lasts for 8 hours. While this ward is active, you are alerted with a mental or audible alarm (your choice) whenever a creature enters the warded area. You can designate creatures that will not set off the ward when you create it.

**Audible Alarm**. The alarm produces the sound of a hammer banging against metal for 10 seconds within 300 feet of the warded area.
**Mental Alarm**. You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you’re asleep.
