# Chest of the Forest Guardian

![[chest-of-forest-guardian.png|right|420]]A large wooden chest, about 24" high, 40" wide, and 24" deep. It has four keyholes, each of the accompanying keys has a different number of teeth and each keyhole is decorated with an animal (fox, badger, eagle, and boar). Opening the chest requires putting each key into the correct hole, or ghostly animals attack.

### Mechanics
If anything other than the correct key (a lockpick, the wrong key) is inserted into a keyhole, the ghostly creatures attack. These creatures form an Emanation 15' around the chest in all directions. Any creature entering the Emanation, or starting their turn there, must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed saved or half as much on a successful save. 

The Emanation stops attacking any creature with the Unconscious condition.
