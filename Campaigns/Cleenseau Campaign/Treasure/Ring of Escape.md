![[gareths-ring.jpg|right|420]]A dusky ring, taken from [[Gareth of Tollen]] after his capture. 
### Mechanics
This black ring has a single use, and loses its magic after it is used. As long as the ring is touching your bare skin, merely thinking the command word causes you to vanish and reappear anywhere within 60 feet. This does not have to be somewhere you can see.

%% This ring was created by [[Lord Umbraeth]] and when used sends a message to him, informing him it has been used %%
