![[ewer-of-liquid.png|right|420]]A strangely unchipped ceramic ewer, decorated with Drankorian words for milk, water, beer, wine, honey, vinegar, tea and oil in stylized patterns running up and down the sides. It holds about a quart of liquid and sounds full of water sloshing around despite being empty. Found in the bandit lair.
