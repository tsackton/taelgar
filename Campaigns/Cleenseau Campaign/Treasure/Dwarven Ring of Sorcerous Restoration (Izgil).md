### Mechanics
_Requires Attunement_

While this ring is on your person and you are attuned to it, you can use a Magic Action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the ring, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
