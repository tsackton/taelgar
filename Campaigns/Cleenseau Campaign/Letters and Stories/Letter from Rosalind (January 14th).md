Received January 18st:

Friends:

I have reached Wisford, and am continuing onward to Embry with all haste. I wept for the land, each village we pass has the same tale of woe. Some have been mysteriously spared, and have seen no dead rise from the ground or walk from afar into their lives. Others have seen a mere handful, one or two. The worst is that rare village where it seems the dead outnumbered the living. In one hamlet, all that remained were two small children, hiding in an attic, and a dozen skeletons, aimlessly pacing through the village square. We dispatched the skeletons, and I have taken the children under my wing. They have not yet spoken.

The Duke of Wisford is riding south to gather what he can of the Army of the South and hopes to break the siege of Fellburn. He is furious at the King's mismanagement of the Army, and does not know why it was not prepared to defend Fellburn. I am wary of such fury - but I can't say he is wrong to be upset at what we have seen in his Duchy.

I will write more when I have news, or reach Embry. I anxiously await any news of how my people are faring in these dark times. I tarry not here, it is best to write me in Embry. 

I hear rumors that several other lords have been summoned to Embry, in particular border lords without ancient title. I do not know what it could mean.

Yours in peace,
Lady Rosalind Essford
The 14th of January, in the blackest year of Robert's reign
