# Labyrinths of the Lost - Session 2
>*in Taelgar: October 17th-18th, 1748*
>*on Earth: November 25th, 2023*
>*[[Western Cymea]]*
# Summary
- The party manages to rest safely in the workshop, unbothered by goblins
- The next morning, they make their way across the grounds to the chapel, avoiding hobgoblin scouts with the aid of Dilion's mechanical dog
- Hiding in the chapel crypt, the party lures in few hobgoblins and quickly dispatches them
- Searching the crypt, they find a secret passage that leads to an abandoned private study of the Pardoli family
- Exploring the manor, the party defeats a group of hobgoblin guards without alerting the building
- The manor courtyard contains a chained basilisk, who attempts to petrify Gaudin, and is probably the source of a large number of statues in the former great hall of the manor
- The master bedroom suite was apparently once occupied by pirates; the ghost of a pirate captain now haunts the bedroom
- The party spoke with the ghost, and Gaudin convinced him to reveal the secret entrance to Grimstone's lair in the basement as the session ended
## The Protagonists
- Asescale, a [[lizardfolk]] alchemist and gambler
- Dilion, a [[Humans|human]] tinkerer and battlesmith
- Gadin, a [[Humans|human]] warlock with a hint of the [[fey]] about him
- Loria Underbough, a [[Halflings|halfling]] wanderer and ranger
# Plot Developments

- Grimstone has a chained basilisk in the courtyard of the manor, which is probably related to all the stone statues around the manor
- The manor was once the lair of a medusa, but she has apparently long since turned to stone herself, and her statue can be found in the overground gardens
- Sometime after the medusa was turned to stone, but before Grimstone moved in, the manor was occupied by pirates
- Grimstone's lair is in the basement, accessed by a trap door in the former master bedroom, guarded by the ghost of a pirate.
