morning at the inn, get letters
sell coins
meet caradoc in the evening, gives them cockatrice task as a trial

## Day 9
level in the morning, pass villages
navigate through forest successfully via Drou
investigate standing stones, hear faint voices, Drou uses comprehend languages to read the writing
enter cave
fazoth searches statue, find dwarven purse
explore dead end, kill shadow + skeleton; yvan defeats ambush by noticing shadow moving on the wall
fazoth vicious mockery causes shadow to miss, which is killed by critical hit sorcerous burst; fazoth eldritch blast destroys skeleton in a burst of force (vunerable to force damage)
return to dwarf chamber, go southwest passage
find main chamber
fight cockatrice - wounded by witch bolt and frightened by Fazoth thaumaturgy + intimidation, but manages to largely avoid drou dissonant whispers due to good saving throws. retreats to drink healing water, teleporting around. yvan goes to scout, finds hatchling. fazoth kills cockatrice with witchbolt (inspiration on die roll)
handle hatchlings fairly easily. collect eggs, leave statute
go to waterfall room (fazoth, yvan)
naiad surprises both fazoth and yvan with hypnotic pattern, both tied up
drou approaches while naiad is angrily arguing that they have to drink the water, deal with the corruption
yvan dives down to get stuff at bottom (avoiding blood born ooze con save each time). naiad still angry. 
eventually freeze the blood born ooze and drop it in the boiling mud in the hatchling room
talk to naiad - including fazoth secret conversation about Umbreath / Gloomshaper and Duskmire and Darkwood
bring everything back outside, camp

## Day 10
return to Roscombe via Caradoc's hut, give him cockatrice stuff and get potions in return
