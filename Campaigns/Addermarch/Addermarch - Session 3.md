## Day 8
We begin in the morning at the Traveler's Rest in Roscombe. As [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] eat breakfast, they receive two letters. [[Letter from Owen Tavish|One]] is from [[Owen Tavish]], the priest of [[The Sibyl]]; the [[Letter from Elowen Duval|other]], sealed with green wax, imprinted with the Duval seal, showing a stylized valley between two mountains with an oak tree in the middle.

During the day, the party rests and relaxes. Sunday is a market day, and [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] goes to the market to find a buyer for the ancient coins he found in [[Torvaine Watch]]. Otherwise, the day passes quietly until the evening, when [[Caradoc]] arrives to meet the party. 

[[Caradoc]] proposes a simple mission as test of the party's skills: travel to a nearby area where a cockatrice is thought to lair, kill it, and bring back a cockatrice gizzard, which is a valuable ingredient in several potion recipes.  
## Day 9
[[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] depart [[Roscombe]] in the morning, heading west through open fields and pastures, towards the hills. Reaching a rocky outcropping indicated as a landmark by [[Caradoc]], the party navigates easily through the forest, guided by [[Drou]], and sees both the cockatrice cave and a [[Kilrath Standing Stones|stone circle]] in the dell below. Faint voices can be heard echoing from the stone circle, and warnings written in an ancient tongue, but the party moves quickly past into the cave. 

Soon, the party finds a statue of a dwarf with its arms broken off, a rotted pouch at its feet hinting at the possessions of a treasure hunter. Exploring the passages that lead from this chamber, they encounter a dead end first, where a shadow attempts to ambush them, thwarted by perceptive [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], who notices the shadow moving. As the skeleton on the ground rises up to attack, [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] taunts it with Vicious Mockery, causing it to miss, while [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] destroys the shadow with a burst of fire. 

Continuing to explore the cave, the party finds the main cavern of the cockatrice, discovering that it has apparently made its lair 


return to dwarf chamber, go southwest passage
find main chamber
fight cockatrice - wounded by witch bolt and frightened by Fazoth thaumaturgy + intimidation, but manages to largely avoid drou dissonant whispers due to good saving throws. retreats to drink healing water, teleporting around. yvan goes to scout, finds hatchling. fazoth kills cockatrice with witchbolt (inspiration on die roll)
handle hatchlings fairly easily. collect eggs, leave statute
go to waterfall room (fazoth, yvan)
naiad surprises both fazoth and yvan with hypnotic pattern, both tied up
drou approaches while naiad is angrily arguing that they have to drink the water, deal with the corruption
yvan dives down to get stuff at bottom (avoiding blood born ooze con save each time). naiad still angry. 
eventually freeze the blood born ooze and drop it in the boiling mud in the hatchling room
talk to naiad - including fazoth secret conversation about Umbreath / Gloomshaper and Duskmire and Darkwood
bring everything back outside, camp

## Day 10
return to Roscombe via Caradoc's hut, give him cockatrice stuff and get potions in return
give bandit stuff back to Lady Duval, get reward
end that evening in the inn
