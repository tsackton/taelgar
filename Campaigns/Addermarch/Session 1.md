## Day 1
The session begins at dawn in [[Valcroix]]. [[Drou]], an elf from [[Orenlas]] [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth de Brune]], a human from the [[Enst]] river valley, and [[Yvan Greenrabbit]], a halfling from [[Sembara]], all on their way to [[Roscombe]] to join the service of the mysterious alchemist [[Caradoc]], have been stuck in Valcroix for several weeks, as late snow and early rain have turned the roads to impassable mud. Now, the weather has cleared, and the group has agreed to escort the halfling merchant [[Oona Strongbones]] to [[Roscombe]]. The caravan -- Oona, her horses and wagon, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan -- departs under sunny skies, and spends the day slowly making their way north and west, following the road to Roscombe along the [[Umber]], past fields, orchards, and small villages. 

## Day 2
An uneventful day of travel, as the road turns southwest, leaving the river and the settled valley and beginning to climb into the [[Torvaine Forest]]. 

## Day 3
*Morning.* The road continues through the forest, ascending in broad curves towards the height of land, where the small garrison of [[Torvaine Watch]] guards the road and collects tolls from travelers. The travel is not entirely uneventful, as [[Drou]], [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], and [[Fazoth de Brune]] manage to successfully push a deadfall tree off the road. Later, just before lunch, the horses are spooked by a common adder sunning itself in the road, and Oona is thrown from the cart. [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] heals her (getting a mild bite from the snake and scaring it off in the process), while [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] calms the horses. 

*Afternoon.* After lunch and a short rest, the group continues along the road. In the late afternoon, [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] notices the road ahead is slightly dug up, and the group is immediately ambushed by a pair of burrowing pig-like creatures called mohlers. Although they are defeated, Oona is nervous, as this is only five miles or so from [[Torvaine Watch]] and there should not be danger on the road so close to the garrison. The party camps for the night.

## Day 4
*Morning.* Continue towards watch. Find body of peddler, recognize from town. Blood sucked clean, and missing gear (but can't find it). Reach watch.

*Early afternoon.* Enter Torvaine Watch. Meet ghost, warns of death. Scout down stairs with pseudodragon, notice zombies. Kill zombies in Mess Hall (Fazoth zombie head kill, Chromatic Orb fire blast - vulnerable, Dissonant Whispers kill, critical hit with dagger). Find iron key on zombies. Unlock door, explore and find cloaks, one missing. Head up the stairs to barrack - kill zombies again (sorcerous bolt exploding die, another Drou dagger critical). Search barracks - find bloody cloak and treasure in chests. Enter Marshal's room, read letter. (Session ends)
