#### Day 4, continued

*Early afternoon, continued.* After taking a short rest in the barracks, Drou, Fazoth, and Yvan proceed across the hoarding to investigate the other tower, spotting Oona on the road below nervously tending her horses. While crossing, the party is attacked by stirges hiding in the rafters, but quickly fights them off. The stirges, however, presumably explain the peddler drained of blood on the road. Reaching the far tower, the party descends the stairs (ignoring several closed doors), following a trail of blood. On the next level, they find an empty common room and a locked door, which is quickly dismantled with fire and eldritch force, revealing an armory. After a quick search turns up only mundane weapons and a chest they cannot unlock, the party moves on. 

Continuing down the stairs to the lowest level, the party entered the smithy, encountering the undead remains of Bartoz, the smith. As he turned to attack with his giant maul, Fazoth wrestled for the weapon with his mage hand while Yvan made fire appear and Drou hit him with a starry wisp. As Fazoth struggled for the maul, the smith attacked, off-balance, missing, and giving Fazoth an opening to stab him with both daggers, pinning him to the wall and then killing him. 

After the fight, the party finally finds the winch room, but realizes that it requires operating from both sides as once to raise the gates. Now that it is clear how the winches operate, though, it is easy enough for Fazoth and Drou to cross over and coordinate raising the winches. 

*Late afternoon.* After raising the gates, but before deciding to leave the Watch, the group decides to explore the top of the tower, where the the Watch commander Sir Enrik Aarpad's quarters probably are. Ascending the stairs, the first thing the party finds is the dead body of Marshal [[Hildo Brask]], apparently prevented from turning into a zombie by his holy symbol of [[The Mother]]. As the air gets colder and the lights dimmer, the party continues towards the ghost of Sir Aarpad. They pass through his study (where they find a locked chest, with coins and items marked with the Aarpad falcon crest) before finding the ghost in the bedroom, where they see the dead body of Sir Aarpad, a strange dagger with a bejeweled hilt lying next to his hand. 

The ghost initially ignores them, but when the party asks about the dagger, it becomes enraged, turning with a shriek that frightened Yvan, who flees. While the ghost is focused on the fleeing Yvan, Fazoth subtly manages to grasp the dagger with mage hand, and then both he and Drou run as they are pelted with flying debris. 

In the barracks below, the party regroups and examines the dagger. Fazoth recalls that the gems in the handle -- serpentine -- are often used to enhance mind-altering enchantments. Deciding to test the dagger, Fazoth's familiar touches the weapon and immediately turns to attack Fazoth, knocking him unconscious with its sting. Fortunately, Drou and Yvan manage to drive it away, and stabilize Fazoth. 

The party leaves the Watch (although Drou and Yvan go back later to recover the Marshal's body for burial and the treasure chest), and spends the night camped with Oona, who is a little disappointed the party didn't discover more about the origin of the cursed dagger but admits dealing with ghosts and curses is more than she hired them for. 
#### Day 5
The party travels uneventfully on uneven roads through the woods, escorting Oona and her cart. 

#### Day 6

Meet soldiers on road going to investigate (names in DM doc)
Conversation a bit iffy; don't mention the treasure
But, Fazoth mentions the dagger and convinces Gareth he is skilled in the arcane and will take care of it (very high roll, otherwise this would be unlikely to work)
Reach Roscombe in the evening

#### Day 7
Meet with castellan, get reward, discuss dagger, pointed to priest
rider comes with news from the watch, reveals the whole story

(session end that evening, back in the inn)
