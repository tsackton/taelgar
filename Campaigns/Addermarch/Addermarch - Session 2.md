#### Day 4
fight stirges, cross hoarding
descend stairs - skip chapel, temple steward wulfram's room
briefly explore common room; bash in armory door, but fail to pick the lock on the chest
descend to smithy - kill bartoz (fire - yvan, radiant - drou, double daggers for the kill - fazoth; fazoth also mage hand disarms bartoz, which doesn't work but does give disadvantage, which saves a hit)
find winch room
go across, find other winch room, raise the gates
go upstairs, find dead body of marshal brask
confront ghost. ghost gets angry when dagger is mentioned, attacks.
yvan frightened, runs
fazoth manages to grab the dagger quickly and sneakily with mage hand
fazoth and drou run, although are bashed by flying debris on the way out, nearly dying
regroup, investigate dagger; fazoth remembers serpentine as a way to enhance mind-altering enchantments
fazoth's familiar touches dagger, goes mad, attacks. knocks fazoth out with its sting
drou and yvan manage to kill the pseudodragon
leave, talk to oona, spend the night
infer that the dagger caused the commander to go mad but otherwise don't get much details. 
oona a little disappointed

#### Day 5
Travel uneventfully

#### Day 6
Meet soldiers on road going to investigate (names in DM doc)
Conversation a bit iffy; don't mention the treasure
But, Fazoth mentions the dagger and convinces Gareth he is skilled in the arcane and will take care of it (very high roll, otherwise this would be unlikely to work)
Reach Roscombe in the evening

#### Day 7
Meet with castellan, get reward, discuss dagger, pointed to priest
rider comes with news from the watch, reveals the whole story

(session end that evening, back in the inn)
