## Narrative 

### Day 15 (Sunday, cont)
We begin on Sunday, in [[Roscombe]]. The party spends the day uneventfully, stopping at the regular weekly market for a few purchases, before meeting [[Caradoc]] in the evening. Caradoc is impressed with their work so far, and proposes a harder challenge: descend into the deep caverns below the earth, and recover [[uligium]], a living mineral that is highly valued for alchemical purposes. The party agrees.

### Day 16 (Monday)
The party spends the next day in preparation, buying rope and other supplies for cave exploration, and asking  [[Colette du Bois]] and others around town for information about the closest deep cave system.

### Day 17 (Tuesday)
The party departs [[Roscombe]] early, heading west towards where rumors indicate the deepest cave system nearby is located. The first part of the journey, along a cart track towards the village of [[Fontwick]], is uneventful as the party passes through fields and pastures. Around mid-afternoon, the party encounters two distraught dairy farmers, [[Samatha of Fontwick]] and [[Godfrey of Fontwick]]. Their cows have been killed by a terrible burrowing insect creature of massive size, and they are fleeing towards [[Roscombe]] to ask for aid from Lady [[Elowen Duval]]. 

The party decides to help, and [[Samatha of Fontwick]] leads them back to her farm while [[Godfrey of Fontwick]] continues to [[Roscombe]] to inform [[Elowen Duval]] of the happenings. The party keeps watch on the fields through the evening, until around midnight an ankheg bursts from the ground and attacks. Quickly both [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]] and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] attack it with witch bolts, but it burrows underground, breaking the connect of the spell. Nonetheless, it is subdued without serious trouble.

### Day 18 (Wednesday)
We end the morning of the next day. [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] gives [[Samatha of Fontwick]] a substantial sum of coins to buy new cows; she is incredibly thankful, offering bread, cheese, and apples for the road.
