## Narrative
### Day 19 (Thursday, cont)
We start in late morning, in the cave far beneath the ground, where the party has come to search for uligium, an alchemical substance used for potions. The group proceeds southeast along a narrow passage, emerging in a large dark cavern, with a large skeleton in the middle. Yvan investigates the bones, which animate and attack. In the ensuing battle, Drou advances with her fluid dance and hits the skeleton multiple times, doing significant damage to the brittle bones with her fists, while Yvan attacks with a chromatic orb and Fazoth shoots a bolt of electrical energy, which misses the skeleton. Fazoth recovers, though, and, inspired by Drou, lands an eldritch blast to destroy the skeleton, though Yvan, full of magical energy, finds himself frightened of the skeletal arm. 

Searching the area, the party finds several passageways leading from this cavern, as well as a pit that drops hundreds of feet. Fazoth's pseudodragon descends to investigate the pit, finding a strange underground road at the bottom. A few miles to the west, among the ruins of a clearly ancient underground city, the head of a sapphire dragon emerges, glances curiously at the pseudodragon, and destroys it. Fazoth resummons the pseudodragon and then sends it the other direction, eventually finding a cave-in which seems to have killed a dwarf, clearly ancient from their armor and the four golden coins the pseudodragon brings back for Fazoth. After this exploration, the party searches another small cavern connected to the main chamber, finding uligium here, and takes a short rest to have a midday meal and recover. 

After lunch, the party follows the southeast exit from the main cavern. Reaching another pit -- shallower this time -- they cross, with Fazoth demonstrating his misty step. On the far side, piercers drop from the ceiling. While Drou is hit, Fazoth manages to dodge, and Yvan trips at just the right time leaving the piercer to land helplessly on the ground behind him. Continuing to explore, the party finds another small passage leading to a chamber with wet rocks and more uligium. 

The wet rocks turn out to be gray oozes. Yvan fires a chromatic orb, which bounces from ooze to ooze but the cold does not seem to damage them very much. However, the magic of the spell does make the oozes vulnerable to piercing damage, prompting Drou to move in with her daggers, making several devastating attacks, as the daggers slowly corrode in the acid of the oozes. Fazoth's pseudodragon contributes with its claws. Drou falls victim to the acid attacks, but is revived by Yvan's potion, and manage to finish off the oozes with her daggers nearly disintegrated. We end the session as the battle concludes.
