Enter room 2. Yvan investigates the bones, the skeleton stands up.

scout the pit -> dwarven long road. to west, 2 1/2 miles to a sapphire dragon lair amid dwarven ruins, pseudodragon killed and resummoned; to east, 1 mile to a cave-in, ancient buried dwarf (posslbly 2000 years old based on armor); pseudodragon brings back 4 ancient dwarven coins for Fazoth
find oolegium (vial 1); short rest
go southeast; cross pit by climbing down and climbing up, Fazoth misty step
Drou hit by piercers, everyone else dodges (Yvan by luck point - trips and it misses)
find oolegium - fight grey oozes. Yvan cold chromatic orb bounces but resisted, but triggers vunerable to piercing damage surge; pseudodragon and Drou daggers are clutch (but each of Drou daggers has a -2 penalty now). Drou goes down, Yvan heals with potion, then Drou kills with daggers.
