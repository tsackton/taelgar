Here is the NPC I made - melee ranger high elf (Elendil), fought in the war against Cha'mutte and the hobgoblin wars in the years after, saw his entire company destroyed in an ambush (along with most of his family and friends, as the elves took a very heavy toll in the wars after the fall of Cha'mutte). Spent a while wandering in the far north, eventually made his way to Sembara, and in particular the Wild Marches (borderlands between the unsettled and magically destroyed Plaguelands -- the territory the red mist spread through during the end of our high school campaign -- and Sembara). Joined up with the Rangers (who probably need a new name...), who spend a lot time patrolling the Wild Marches. Has been in the area for past 50 years or so. 

  

Based on the Primeval Guardian ranger, from an [Unearthed Arcana](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2017_01_UA_RangerRogue_0117JCMM.pdf), but all the relevant stuff is on the character sheet -- the main class ablity is being able to turn into a tree basically during combat (5' movement but +5' reach and other benefits). Designed around polearm in combat (15' reach in tree form), with javelins as backup. The image is the elven fighters in the beginning of the prologue of LOTR (Fellowship) fighting Sauron, but for mechanical reasons (Strength build) uses javelins instead of bow as ranged option. 

  

His role in the party is basically supposed to be a guide, and also an opportunity to do a little role-playing and world-building outside of town, giving them someone to interact with. The kids don't really roleplay in character that much but they like stories about the world a lot, and they like world-building details (they were at a market in a town a few sessions ago and bought a book about Drankorian history and Nathaniel's character started reading it on the spot and Nathaniel was quite disappointed I didn't have a real book about Drankorian history already written). In 2-3 sessions they are likely heading into a trackless, dangerous forest and so Maglor is designed around making that not impossible and overly daunting for them (e.g. with forest as favored terrain).

  

On the campaign: Generally in southern Sembara right now there has been a lot of raiding and attacks stirred up by hobgoblins and a mysterious group of humans, hobgoblins, and allies know as the Cinder Court. So lots of refugees have been leaving the southernmost settled areas and fleeing to stronger towns, etc. Currently the party is traveling south from Adderfell (the biggest town and the Earl's seat in the Earldom of Addermarch, one of the WIld Marches protecting the border of Sembara -- loosely inspired by a tiny bit of reading about the medieval Welsh Marches) to investigate Darkwood Keep, the southernmost military outpost of Addermarch, which has gone silent for weeks. A doppleganger recently reported that all was well, but was discovered by the party and Earl Eofric (the ruler of Addermarch), so everyone is quite concerned that something bad has happened at the Keep. The local leader of the Rangers sent Maglor along with the party to aid and make sure that the Rangers got word of what was happening as quickly as possible. 

  

Since leaving Adderfell (in case you didn't hear from Zachary), they've rescued a grumpy shepherd from giant vultures, dealt with their horse running away in a thunderstorm (which also made the road a muddy mess), camped the night in a ruined Drankorian road house that doubled as an occasional makeshift Ranger shelter, and then the next morning found a chopped down orchard with a Cinder Court flag planted, and tracked the offenders (bugbear + hogobin raiding party) and killed them. 

  

Rough map of the area is below. The small circle on the lake is Adderfell, the capital. The area is know for apples, cider, brandy, and dairy (kind of like Normandy but with a northern Virginia climate). The keep where they are heading is at the bottom of the map. Maglor would also be well aware that this area, especially as you get closer to the border, has a lot of "leakage" from Shadowfell (/shadow fey), and the original inhabitants (before Drankor) constructed various magic circles to protect their lands from things crossing over, but these have not been maintained. One of the Ranger patrol duties now is to keep an eye out for boggles, darklings, various other weird fey creatures out for mischief and kill or drive them away. 

  

Anyway, that is what I have. Happy to fill in any other details you want but you can also just make stuff up.
