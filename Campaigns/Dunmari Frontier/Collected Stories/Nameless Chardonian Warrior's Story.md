## The Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
(as told to [[Kenzo]] in [[Session 55-56 (DuFr)]])

As [[Kenzo]] listens, the warrior tells his tale: he was born in a small village outside [[Chardon]], and got caught up in the [[Great War]], fighting with elves against dragons and hobgoblins. After the war, though he survived, he could not escape the loss, death, and destruction, could not keep his familyâ€™s farm alive as sickness spread across the land.
