# Nameless Chardonian Warrior's Story
([[Session 64 (DuFr)|collected by]] [[Kenzo]])

As [[Kenzo]] listens, the warrior tells his tale: he was born in a small village outside [[Chardon]], and got caught up in the [[Great War]], fighting with [[elves]] against [[dragons]] and [[hobgoblins]]. After the war, though he survived, he could not escape the loss, death, and destruction, could not keep his familyâ€™s farm alive as sickness spread across the land.
