(as told to [[Kenzo]] in [[Session 43 (DuFr)]])

[[Justan]] had a good life, once. He grew up north of [[Tokra]], traveled across the fertile plains with his family, raising horses. They weren’t famous or anything, but they did well, had plenty of food to eat, shelter from the weather, a good life. When the troubles started in the east, they wanted to help, and headed for [[Tokra]], trying to help feed and care for the refugees. Until the sickness, the plague that struck the horses during the height of the refugee crisis. They lost nearly their entire herd, made penniless in the spend of a few weeks, not even enough animals left to travel. So, [[Justan]] thought, if the gods have abandoned us, I will take what I need to recover. And he came west, to the [[Copper Hills]], to steal a sack of coin to start again.
