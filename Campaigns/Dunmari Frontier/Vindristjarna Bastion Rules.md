# Vindristjarna Bastion Mechanics

Vindristjarna carries with it a number of special facilities that provide in game benefits. Currently, Vindristjarna has the following special facilities, described in detail below, and associated with the following people.

## Special Facility Rules

*Special Facility Mechanics: As a way to balance the goals of keeping to the spirit of the bastion rules, while also maintaining in-world verisimilitude, the following rules apply to Vindristjarna Special Facilities.*

(1) Some special facilities have prerequisites. If a special facility has prerequisites that a character does not meet, they may still choose that special facility as long as (i) there is a good role-playing rationale, and (ii) the character is at least 4 levels higher than the special facility level.
(2) Vindristjarna is mobile, which makes it more powerful than many bastions. As a trade-off, it can only host bastions up to a fixed size, after which there is no more room to expand. The upper deck and belowdecks are each 480 squares, while the hold is only 185 squares due to the slope of the sides. 
(3) Bastion facilities have a number of effects. While anything that only requires you to rest in the Bastion will obviously function as expected, anything that requires work needs a person to do the work (although "combined" facilities can generally be worked by a single follower, and in general we can assume followers are more productive and useful than a typical "Bastion hireling"). This is just meant to reflect the trade off between mobility and the fact you can't support as large a crew as a fixed Bastion could support.
(4) Each character can have a single level 17 facility; I also reserve the right to limit the number of level 13 facilities you can take.

### Storage Deck
*36 of 185 squares used*

The storage deck is currently unfinished and is primarily used as an actual storage hold.

> [!info]+ Storage Hold
> > Tended by: [[Adam Gower]], from [[Tollen]]
> >Game Effect: Storehouse
> >Size: 36 squares (Vast)
> > Order: Trade (1d4 BP)
> 
> This cool, dark space is meant to contain trade goods (see the Trade Goods table in the Player’s Handbook) but can hold almost anything. When you issue the Trade order to this facility, its hireling spends the next 7 days procuring nonmagical items that have a total value of 500 GP or less and stores them in the Storehouse, or the hireling uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Storehouse. You bear the total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases to 2,000 GP when you reach level 9 and 5,000 GP when you reach level 13. The Equipment chapter of the Player’s Handbook has tables of common goods that can be bought. When you sell goods from your Storehouse, the buyer pays you 10 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 20 percent when you reach level 9, 50 percent when you reach level 13, and 100 percent when you reach level 17.
