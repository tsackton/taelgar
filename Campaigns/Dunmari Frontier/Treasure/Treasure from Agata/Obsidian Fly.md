### Obsidian Fly

A small black obsidian fly. Can speak a command word to summon the fly, and whomever summons it can speak the same word to turn it back into a figurine. Will attack anyone who summons it who is not its master, and cannot take a new master until its old master is dead. 

It is not clear the origin of this item. Taken from [[Agata]]â€™s person. Fed to a giant worm under a monastery, but recovered. Kind of an asshole. 

Learned from [[Arryn]], the mirror wizard at the edge of the [[endless ocean]] that it cannot serve a new master until its old master is dead.
