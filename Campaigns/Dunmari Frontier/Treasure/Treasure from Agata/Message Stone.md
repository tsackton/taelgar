These message stones are of Drankorian origin. Taken from [[Samerki]] and [[Agata]]. Have a known range of at least 100 miles, but do not work across interplanar boundaries. Can be used for 5 minutes per day.

Each message stone comes paired to one or more other stones, and allow one to speak as if one were at the location of the paired stone. 

[[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] have a paired set.
