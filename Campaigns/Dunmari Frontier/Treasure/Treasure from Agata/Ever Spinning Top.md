### Ever Spinning Top

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3819604-always-spinning-top) 
  
A small metal top that spins continuously while it is being observed. Radiates divination magic. Probably of Drankorian origin. Taken from [[Agata]]â€™s hut. Carried by [[Wellby]] until taken by [[Kadmos]] in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]]. 

Probably designed not just as a toy, but as a way to detect scrying.
