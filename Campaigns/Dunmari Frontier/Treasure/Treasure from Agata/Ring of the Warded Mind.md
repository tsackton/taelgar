## Ring of the Warded Mind

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3710482-ring-of-the-warded-mind). 

A dull silver ring that radiates abjuration magic, that seems hard to focus on. Dwarven in origin according to [[Seeker]]. Taken from [[Agata]]’s person. 

Supposedly contained the soul of [[Typhina]], a native of the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] who was once the guardian of a tree that contains the essence of all trees, and left to hunt down [[Agata]].

#### Typhina's Story

[[Typhina]] tells you she was once the guardian of an ancient tree in the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]], a tree that was the essence of wood itself. [[Agata]], when she was banished from the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]], stole a branch of this tree, and [[Typhina]] was sent to retrieve it. She failed, and [[Agata]] killed her, but, she says, [[Agata]] did not know of the power of her ring. When she died, her soul was preserved in this ring, and now she is seeking a way to return to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]], where she believes she can be reborn. The ring itself, she says, was the gift of a Dwarven scholar, [[Daruk]], who traveled to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] many years ago, seeking to understand the elemental essence of living things. 

Actually, however, "[[Typhina]]" was [[Agata]] in disguise, the real [[Typhina]] having been killed by [[Agata]] in the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] realm of [[Amberglow]] long ago. Unclear where the ring came from.
