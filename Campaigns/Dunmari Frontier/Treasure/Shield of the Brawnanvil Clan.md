![[brawnanvil-shield.jpg|right|350]]This shield is an elaborate, decorative shield, not useful in battle, made of polished steel, with  decorations of scenes from dwarven life adorning it. It is a family heirloom of the Brawnanvils, a dwarven clan originally from[[Ardith]], now based in [[Tharn Todor]]. 

While holding the shield, a dwarf can activate it, being drawn into a recreation of a story from the Brawnanvil past. A Brawnanvil can guide the story to a particular memory or place.

This shield was lost in the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)]] when the Brawnanvils and many others fled during the [[Great War]]. It was later recovered by [[Riswynn]] and returned to the Brawnanvil clan stronghold in [[Tharn Todor]].
