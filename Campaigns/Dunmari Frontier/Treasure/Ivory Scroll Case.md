# The Ivory Scroll Case

An elaborate ivory scroll case. This once contained a scroll of demon summoning, given to the leader of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] by [[Agata|Agata Dustmother]], in partial payment for the [[Scepter of Command]]. The scroll this case once contained was used to summon [[Oduk]], a demon of the Abyss, to create a gnoll army, provoking the [[Summer Gnoll Raids of 1748]] and allowing the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] to slip into [[Tokra]] undetected, with the waves of refugees.

One end of this scroll case was found by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] outside Raven's Hold on [[Session 13 (DuFr)|April 13, 1748]]. The remaining case and cap were found by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] in[[Tokra]]. The intact case was sold in [[Darba]] for 80 gp.

Some of its history was revealed by [[Mirror of the Past]]:
