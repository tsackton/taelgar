# Horn of Silent Alarm

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/horn-of-silent-alarm)

The party has one of these items, apparently a fairly common Dunmari magic item.

One, carried by Delwath, was taken from the reformed Dunmari bandits, after they were cruelly murdered by dastardly Chardonians.

A second, once carried by Kenzo, is from the fort east of [[Gomat]], found on the body of Dunmari scout from more than a hundred years ago, in Session 3. This horn has an etched running horse design. It was sacrificed as part of the ritual to free Kenzo from the cursed soul chain that he acquired while freeing Motua. 

%%Created by the Dunmari for use by scouts and outriders. Kenzo's dates to the generation after the Great War, from the time of the Bitter Knife wars; Delwath's is older, dating to the Great War.%%
