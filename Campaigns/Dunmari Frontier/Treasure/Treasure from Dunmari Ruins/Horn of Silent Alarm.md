# Horn of Silent Alarm

[Mechanics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/horn-of-silent-alarm)

The party currently has one of these, apparently a fairly common Dunmari magic item.

One, carried by [[Delwath]], [[Session 45 (DuFr)|was taken]] from [[Justan]], a perhaps-reformed Dunmari bandit, after he and his companions were cruelly murdered by [[Casian|dastardly]] [[Kadmos|Chardonians]].

A second, once carried by [[Kenzo]], [[Session 3 (DuFr)|was found]] in the ruined Dunmari [[Dunmari Fort (Gomat)|fort]] east of the [[Gomat]] oasis, on the body of Dunmari scout who apparently died more than a hundred years ago. This horn has an etched running horse design. It was [[Session 63 (DuFr)|sacrificed]] as part of the ritual to free [[Kenzo]] from the cursed soul chain that [[Session 55-56 (DuFr)|he acquired]] while freeing [[Motua]].
