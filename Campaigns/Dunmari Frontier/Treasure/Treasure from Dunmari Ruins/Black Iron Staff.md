A staff of black iron, carved with words in Draconic, but not magical. Words read: "I bind you to the black wind, I bind you to my flame, I bind you in my power until the sun fails and the moon is dead." 

Taken from the undead creature in the fort east of Gomat, and given to the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]].
