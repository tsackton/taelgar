# The Eudomes' Mirror
>[!info]+ Information
> (very rare magical mirror)

A large ornate wall mirror, originally mounted in [[Eudomes]]' bedroom in [[Stormcaller Tower]], found by Delwath in [[Session 16 (DuFr)]].

When an object is shown to the mirror and a question is asked, the mirror shows scenes of the item that, potentially, reflect the question asked, depending on the insight and willpower of the question asker. 
This was inadvertently discovered by Delwath when he asked the mirror how to get out of Eudomes' bedroom while a reflection of the door could be seen, which of course showed him imagines of people who had come and gone through the door. 

Can be used once per week. 

## Mechanics

To use the mirror, you hold an object to it and ask it a question about the object. The power of the mirror is not specific, so it will not always show you a direct answer. To guide the mirror, you can make a Wisdom check; the higher the total, the more likely the mirror is to show you want you want to see, although nothing is guaranteed.
