### Binding Stones

A set of five crystals, each a different color, originally located on the crown carved into the stone head of [[Hralgar]] in [[Stormcaller Tower]]. [[Seeker]]’s study reveals these are part of a complex mechanism to imprison, incapacitate, and then draw magical power from a creature, but exactly how to combined them to create magical effects is not yet clear. 

Taken by the party from [[Fausto]] while fleeing his tower in [[Session 48 (DuFr)]].
