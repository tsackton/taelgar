# Flaming Tempest Logs

The log books of the Flaming Tempest. Wellby, using his experience in navigation, was able to reconstruct the path of the Flaming Tempest based on these logs, to roughly the following:

- (DR:: 1747-04-09) *(Flaming Tempest):* Departs Skaer Islands and begins raiding local shipping on the coast of Vostok, avoiding traditional Tollender and halfling shipping lanes
- (DR:: 1747-06-23) *(Flaming Tempest):* Departs Vostok coast, sailing east by northeast along the coast
- (DR:: 1747-07-30) *(Flaming Tempest):* Arrives in Irrla, after hugging the coast for a month with many stops in the barren lands between Skaerhem and Ursk
- (DR:: 1747-09-04) *(Flaming Tempest):* Departs Irrla, sailing southwest towards the southern coast of the Cymean Peninsula
- (DR:: 1747-10-02) *(Flaming Tempest):* Begins raiding off the southern coast of the Cymean Peninsula
- (DR:: 1748-02-23) *(Flaming Tempest):* Puts into harbor in a small island off the Cymean coast
- (DR:: 1748-04-01) *(Flaming Tempest):* Departs small island off the Cymean coast
- (DR:: 1748-05-03) *(Flaming Tempest):* Arrives at Vetta
