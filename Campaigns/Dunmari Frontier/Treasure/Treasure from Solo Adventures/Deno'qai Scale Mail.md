A suit of scale mail armor, subtly designed with [[tanshi]] motifs, and lightweight enough to be worn under winter gear. It has green and blue highlights, but is otherwise muted brown.

This armor was created during the [[Great War]] for the Deno'qai hero [[Balati]], and later gifted to [[Delwath]] of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] while he was on a quest to free lost tanshi who had been trapped during the [[Great War]].
