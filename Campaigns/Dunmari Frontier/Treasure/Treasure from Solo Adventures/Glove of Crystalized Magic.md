## Glove of Crystallized Magic

A glove constructed by [[Seeker]] in [[Shimmersong]], from shards of crystalized magic gifted to [[Seeker]] by [[Illaran]]. These shards allow you to manipulate magic as you cast spells, currently either by changing the range of spells, or by shifting the elemental effects of a spell.Â
