![[shadow-armband.png|right|400]]An armband created by Cha’mutte and used to open portals to shadow realms during the [[Great War]]. The armbands were created in pairs, with each pair attuned to a particular shadow realm, allowing portals to be opened a great distance apart in Taelgar that could be spanned in a short amount of time by crossing through the pocket dimension. 

[[Delwath]] has an armband that is one of a pair (the other pair is lost or destroyed), which opens a portal to a pocket realm where a large hobgoblin army has been trapped since the [[Great War]]. Activating the portal requires attunement to the armband. In [[Delwath]]'s experience, being attuned drains you and weakens you, however.
