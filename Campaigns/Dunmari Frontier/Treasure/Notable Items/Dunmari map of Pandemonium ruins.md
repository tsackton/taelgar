A map of the ruins of the Pandemonium fort, north of [[Tokra]] created by the Dunmari during [[Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]. Contains notes on the secret paths to avoid the effects of [[Pandemonium]] while approaching.

Found in the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]] by [[Govir]], which led to his kidnapping and infection with lycanthropy. Recovered by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and kept for safekeeping.
