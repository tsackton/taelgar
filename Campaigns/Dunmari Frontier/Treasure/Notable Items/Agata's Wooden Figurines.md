A collection of detailed, lifelike wooden carvings of people found in Agata's house, all of which radiate complex transmutation magic.

- A young girl, maybe 3 years old, with light brown skin and dark shoulder-length hair, big, curious brown eyes, and a chubby face, now broken in half and no longer radiating magic. This is [[Jumi]]. Freed. Casting Dispel Magic on [[Jumi]] herself, mostly turned to wood, ended the magic on [[Jumi]] and the figure of [[Jumi]].Â 
- An older halfling man, easily into his 80s or 90s, with a wrinkled face, stained traveling clothes, blue eyes and curly graying hair. Tentatively identified as one of the Tealeaf family, a large merchant clan that once traded between [[Chardon]] and eastern [[Dunmar]]. Freed; name is [[Garret Tealeaf]], captured by [[Agata]] 11 years ago.
- [[Kaya|A young woman]], maybe around 16, with dark brown skin, long braided black hair, and green eyes, wearing ill-fitting chain mail and carrying a spear. Probably Dunmari, but the clothes are very archaic. Freed; but at the moment fairly catatonic and has not spoken.
- [[Shandar|A middle aged man]], maybe 50, wearing stained and repeatedly mended riding clothes, with short cropped white hair, lightly tanned, with a bony, lined face and a bow and quiver on his back. Probably Dunmari, but the clothes are very archaic. Freed; but at the moment fairly catatonic and has not spoken.
