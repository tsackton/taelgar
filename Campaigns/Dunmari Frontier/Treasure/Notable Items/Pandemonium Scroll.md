# Pandemonium Scroll

A strange scroll, with writing in an impossible language. The runes wiggle and squirm when one tries to look at them, and caused mild nausea and confusion. Can somehow be used to draw the plane of [[Pandemonium]] close to the material world. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
Can, according to [[Seeker]]’s identity spell, somehow “bring the plane of [[Pandemonium]] closer to Taelgar”. Taken from [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] lair. 

Looked at in [[Mirror of the Past]]: [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision]]

Traded to [[Fausto]] as part of the deal for [[Hralgar's Eyes]]. Kept by [[Fausto]] when he betrayed the party.
