An elaborate decorative shield, not useful in battle. It is made of polished steel, with elaborate decorations of scenes from Dwarven life adorning it.

While holding the shield, a dwarf can activate it, being drawn into a recreation of a story from the Brawnanvil past. A Brawnanvil can guide the story to a particular memory or place.

Recovered by [[Riswynn]] and now safely with the Brawnanvil clan in [[Tharn Todor]].
