![[portable-hole-dunmar-fellowship.jpg|right|400]]This portable hole was received as a [[Session 42 (DuFr)|gift]] from [[Basu]], a mystai of Laka, in exchange for helping clear the excess extraplanar energy from the [[Elven Arborea Workshop]] beneath the [[Lakan Monastery]], permeated with the essence of [[Arborea]]. 

Upon receiving the portable hole, the Dunmar Fellowship was warned to follow these four rules:
- Never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal
- No fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 
- Be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 
- Don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane.
