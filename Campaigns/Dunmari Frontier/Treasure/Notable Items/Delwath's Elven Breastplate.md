[[Delwath]]'s old battle armor from his time as a quartermaster in the elven armies during the [[Great War]], transformed and infused with the magic of the shadow plane, an embodied fragment of which is now embedded in the center of the armor. 

Found on [[Delwath]] when [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]] recovered him in the desert, and returned to him in [[Session 20 (DuFr)]].
