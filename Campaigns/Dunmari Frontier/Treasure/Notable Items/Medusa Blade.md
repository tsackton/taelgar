A cursed sword taken from [[Agata]]'s lair. Grants the bearer the power to turn those they strike to stone, but will turn on the bearer as well, if given the chance. 

Destroyed by the Baharzel at Riswynn's request, freeing [[Havdar]] of its curse. 

 ([[Havdar]]). A longsword decorated with reptilian motifs, radiates transmutation magic. Probably of fey origin, but hard to say, its design is unfamiliar. Taken from [[Agata]]â€™s hut. Cursed, and responsible for turning [[Havdar]] to stone at one point, as well as his increasing paranoia in the fall of 1748. Destroyed by the [[Bahrazel]] in answer to [[Riswynn]]'s prayers, freeing Havdar of the curse, in [[Session 69 (DuFr)]].  %%SECRET[1]%%
