A ciphered scroll, recovered from the captain's cabin on the [[Flaming Tempest]], in the hand of [[Urgall the Black]]. It reads, in translation:

>The words of [[Mashtu the Corruptor]], who has given me power over the ocean, recorded here in secret least I forget my purpose. 
>
>[[Urgall the Black|Urgall]], the voice said. You will go to the sacred places on these seas: the holy wells of Parmo, the sacred waters of [[Vetta]], the waters beneath Quanyi, the ancient temple among the ruins of Nkasa, the blessed springs of Beresa, and the sunken garden of Inulvis.
>
>Six times you will summon me, and six times I will come to corrupt the ancient waters. 
>
>Six times you will be bathed in my power, and six times you will emerge stronger.
>
>Once you have done this, you will control the very sea itself, from east to west, as far as water can flow.
