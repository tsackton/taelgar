A [[Phasing Stones|Phasing Stone]], once possessed by the giant [[Hralgar]], and [[Session 73 (DuFr)|recovered]] from [[Hralgar's Palace|his palace]] in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]

This particular phasing stone encapsulates the power of the [[Dreamworld]]. Now, connected to the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], it powers the magical effects that allow the ship to fly, by allowing one to dream of impossible things.
