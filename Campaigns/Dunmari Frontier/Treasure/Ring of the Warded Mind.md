![[ring-of-warded-mind-seeker.jpg|right|400]]This dull silver ring, of Dwarven make, is difficult to focus on, always seeming to want to slide out of your eyesight. It radiates abjuration magic. 

%%Campaign:dufr%%
[[Agata]] was wearing this ring, and it was taken by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. Soon after [[Seeker]] attuned to this ring, he was telepathically contacted by a fey creature, claiming to be [[Typhina]], a native of the [[Feywild]]. [[Typhina]] said that she was once the guardian of an ancient tree in the [[Heartwood Grove]], in [[Amberglow]], protecting a tree that was the essence of wood itself. [[Agata]], when she was banished from the [[Feywild]], stole a branch of this tree, using it for nefarious magic. [[Typhina]] was sent to retrieve this branch, but she failed, and was killed by [[Agata]]. Yet, [[Typhina]] says, [[Agata]] did not know the power of this ring. When she died, her soul was preserved in this ring, and now she is seeking a way to return to the [[Feywild]], where she believes she can be reborn if she returns to the [[Heartwood Grove]]. The ring, she says, was a gift of the [[Dwarves|dwarven]] scholar [[Daruk]], who traveled to the [[Feywild]] many years ago, seeking to understand the elemental essences of living things. 

For many months, the supposed soul of [[Typhina]] rested patiently in the ring, until the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], with the fey wanderer [[Caulaus]], brought the ring to the [[Heartwood Grove]]. Here they [[Session 67 (DuFr)|learned that Typhina was actually Agata]] in disguise, and the real [[Typhina]] had been killed in the [[Heartwood Grove]] long ago, when Agata stole the branch in the first place.
