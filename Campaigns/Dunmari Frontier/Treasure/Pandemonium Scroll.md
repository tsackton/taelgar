# The Pandemonium Scroll

A strange scroll, with writing in an impossible language. The runes wiggle and squirm when one tries to look at them, and caused mild nausea and confusion. Can somehow be used to draw the plane of [[Pandemonium]] close to the material world. 

## Events
- (DR:: 1748-07-02): Recovered by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] from the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]
- (DR:: 1748-08-24): Given to [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]], in theory in exchange for [[Hralgar's Eyes]] and other items
- (DR:: 1749-05-01): Used to open a rift to [[Pandemonium]] in the middle of Chardon, destroying the scroll and causing extreme death and destruction within the city. [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] were blamed, said to be working for [[Dunmar]], although it was later reveled that in fact dopplegangers created by Apollyon had carried out the attack.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
Can, according to [[Seeker]]’s identity spell, somehow “bring the plane of [[Pandemonium]] closer to Taelgar”. Taken from [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] lair. 

Looked at in [[Mirror of the Past]]: [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision]]

Traded to [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]] as part of the deal for [[Hralgar's Eyes]]. Kept by [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]] when he betrayed the party.
