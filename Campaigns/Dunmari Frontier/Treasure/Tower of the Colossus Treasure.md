- Manual of Stone Golems (locked) [[Taurion's Manual of Golems]]
- Prepared scroll making material. Enough inks and special paper to produce 4 scrolls: 3 up to 3rd level, and 1 up to 5th level. Each scroll requires 8 hours of work to produce, with the kit
- Scrolls of: Sending, Private Sanctum, Reverse Gravity, and Passwall
- Magical lenses that can be used to make a telescope

Left behind in the tower (basement library) are a collection of about 100-150 scrolls, seemingly a literary library (6 scrolls examined, all poems or plays in either Drankorian or Elvish)

Party copied the six scrolls out for reference.
