- [Deno’qai Eagle Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346731-denoqai-eagle-shield) (give to [[Theba]]): A enchanted wooden shield, brightly painted and carved with an eagle motif. While attuned, can cast animal messenger (at 3rd level) at will, but only targeted the eagle motif (so need to wait for it to return to cast again). The eagle messenger can travel up to 5 miles an hour, and can pass through obstacles. %%SECRET[2]%%
- [Deno’qai Lightning Spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346735-denoqai-lightning-spear) (give to [[Theba]]): A spear decorated with lightning motifs. Functions as a +1 spear, with 60 foot short range and no long range. Has 3 charges, which it regains each day at dawn. Can use 3 charges to cause the spear to turn into a lightning bolt as you hurl it, which has the effect of casting the lightning bolt spell but with a range of 60' instead of the normal range of the spell. If you hurl it at a target, make an attack roll against the target as normal: on a hit, they take the normal spear damage and have disadvantage on the lightning bolt saving throw. You can also expend 1 charge to do an extra 2d6 lightning damage on a hit. (Spell Save DC is equal to your 8 + ability score used for the attack roll + proficiency) %%SECRET[2]%%
