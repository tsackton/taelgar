- [Deno’qai Lightning Spear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5346735-denoqai-lightning-spear) (give to [[Theba]]): A spear decorated with lightning motifs. Functions as a +1 spear, with 60 foot short range and no long range. Has 3 charges, which it regains each day at dawn. Can use 3 charges to cause the spear to turn into a lightning bolt as you hurl it, which has the effect of casting the lightning bolt spell but with a range of 60' instead of the normal range of the spell. If you hurl it at a target, make an attack roll against the target as normal: on a hit, they take the normal spear damage and have disadvantage on the lightning bolt saving throw. You can also expend 1 charge to do an extra 2d6 lightning damage on a hit. (Spell Save DC is equal to your 8 + ability score used for the attack roll + proficiency) %%SECRET[1]%%
