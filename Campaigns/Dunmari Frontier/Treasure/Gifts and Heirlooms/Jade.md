### Jade Fragments

Fragments of jade that were originally [[Rai]]'s hand. 

Seen in [[Eudomes' Mirror]]: [[Kenzo's Jade Vision]]

Five pieces are thought to exist, scattered across Taelgar by the failed attempt to cleanse the [[Plaguelands]] by [[Rai]] and the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]]. Somehow the jade fragments are associated with keeping [[Apollyon]] imprisoned. 

One piece fell in the Dunmari desert, and was given to [[Kenzo]] by his parents before they died. 

One piece fell in the [[Elderwood]], was found by the Godcaller [[Jordo]], became part of the protection of the [[Te'kula]], and was eventually gifted to [[Kenzo]] by [[Alayah]], [[Jordo]]'s successor. 

Three pieces are lost. Some clues to their locations were seen in [[Kenzo]] and [[Alayah]]'s [[Second Dream of Rai]], which indicated pieces of the hand fell in the desert (Dunmar; now carried by Kenzo), an ancient forest (the Elderwood; carried by Alayah and gifted to Kenzo); a crevasse in an icy glacier; beneath the ocean; and in a dense, lush rainforest.

Further information has suggested possible locations for two of the three lost fragments:

- The fragment that fell in the icy glacier was apparently found by someone from them mysterious land called [[Ursk]]; it came into the possession of [[Radomir]], who tried to flee with it, but eventually returned to [[Ursk]]. The fragment was then taken from him. 
- The fragment that fell in the ocean apparently fell into a "forest of jade" underneath the sea, a forest where merfolk grow names; tales of this place were the inspiration for Thomas Hawke's play [[Luminastra's Gift]]. This forest of jade is apparently a kelp forest located about 650 miles west of Chardon, a hundred or so miles off the coast of the western peninsula.
