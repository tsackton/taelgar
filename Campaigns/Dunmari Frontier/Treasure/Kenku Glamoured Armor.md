![[kenku-glamoured-armor-wellby.jpg|right|400]]This suit of studded leather armor is glamoured with illusion magic. While worn, its appearance adapts to wearer, and can be controlled at will when attuned. 

This suit was found [[Grimbaskal's Hoard]], and later enhanced by [[Nahto]], the kenku tinkerer, to be able to summon glamoured wings and allow the wearer to fly for a few hours a day.Â
