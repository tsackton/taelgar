Originally of kenku make. Can change appearance to any item of clothing, and is a +1 suit of studded leather armor. Allows you to cast Feather Fall at will, targeting yourself only. Found in [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]’s hoard.

The kenku armor [[Wellby]] found in [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]’s hoard was enhanced by [[Nahto]], the kenku tinkerer, to be able to summon glamoured wings and allow the wearer to fly for a few hours a day.
