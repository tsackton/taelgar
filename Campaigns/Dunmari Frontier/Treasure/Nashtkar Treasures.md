## Found in Bhishma Monastery

- Monk's journal from the [[Great War]] era ([[Monastery of Bhishma]], [[Kenzo]]). A small diary, written in Dunmari, of an unnamed monk, who seemed to have lived here just before the [[Great War]]. The entries describe life in the monastery, the joy of the craft of parchment making and especially skill required to turn it into something that could take enchantments. Then,  increasing danger and the growing militarization of [[Kharsan]], several attacks, news of distant heroes and great councils, then no news, which was worse. Then, people running scared of the red death, everyone fleeing east. Last entry: choosing to stay with the elders, contribute how I can to protecting our great work. [[Bhishma]] watch over my soul. No obvious value although to the right person could be worth 5-30 gp.
- Blank spell scroll ([[Monastery of Bhishma]], [[Seeker]]). Valuable, could be sold to the right person for 50-300 gp. 

- Speak with Dead. ([[Monastery of Bhishma]]), used in [[Session 86 (DuFr)]] %%SECRET[3]%%
