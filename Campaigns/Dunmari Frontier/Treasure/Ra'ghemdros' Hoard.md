# Portable Hole Calculations

Volume of the Portable Hole is 282 cubic feet. A little more than 10% is taken up with shelving and miscellaneous organization, leaving 250 cubic feet of usable space. 

Stored in that space are:
- Both mirrors (3 cubic feet each) = 6 cubic feet
- Basic supplies for a week (5 cubic feet) = 5 cubic feet
- Treasure for bribes (1 cubic foot in coins, 3 cubic feet in other) = 4 cubic feet
- Misc magic items stored in the portable hole = 1 cubic foot

That leaves 250-16 = 234 cubic feet for items found on the Circular Island

The biggest of these is Cloudspinner, who is encased in a rectangle 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep = 96 cubic feet. There are maybe 10 cubic feet worth of metals from the tower, plus another few cubic feet from other items, mostly the platter and the ewer.

That leaves 125 cubic feet for treasure from Ra'ghemdros' hoard.
# Ra'ghemdros' Hoard

## Coins

Ra'ghemdros has collected basically every coin on the island, which amounts to about 500,000 silver coins; 700,000 copper coins; 30,000 gold coins. These are all Drankorian, and are neatly arranged in designs and patterns, ordered from oldest to newest, with different metals separated. With some investigation can find coins as far back as the height of the Great Peace in the DR 600s, although most coins date from Vestian or later, and many are from Apollyon's reign (last ~150 years of the Empire).

Volume (simplifying assumptions):
- 30,000 gold coins per cubic foot
- 20,000 silver coins per cubic foot
- 15,000 copper coins per cubic foot

## Common Jewelry
Most of Ra'ghemdros' hoard consists of various examples of common, non-magical jewelry, which are detailed in sections below. 

### Rings
There are 15,000 rings in Ra'ghemdros hoard. Most of these are simple bands or signet rings of iron or bronze, but about one-fifth of the rings (3000) in the hoard are more elaborate. These are often signet rings with carved gemstone intaglios, often in moonstone, amethyst, lapis lazuli, garnet, amber, or onyx; solid gold bands of various designs, typically involving animal shapes; or elaborate metalwork with gemstone settings. 

Diamonds, pearls, and rubies -- being important components for amplifying and channeling magic -- are not really used for rings in Drankor, as they reserved typically for imperial use or for common enchantments.  

Value:
- Plain rings: typically between 1-20 sp per ring, although with some care and effort to select the best work could reach up to 50 sp for some items.
- Elaborate rings: 1-50 gp per ring, with with some care and effort to select the best work could reach 500 gp or more for some items, particularly imperial or other high-status jewelry set with particularly valuable gemstones. 

Volume (assuming relatively low packing volume and some bulky settings):
- 6000 plain rings per cubic foot
- 3000 elaborate rings per cubic foot

Examples:
 - **A Gold Signet Ring**: Set with an engraved emerald with the personal crest of a long-lost merchant or other rich citizen of Drankor. 
 - **A Twisted Silver Band**: Elaborately worked, and set with a perfect diamond that sparkles with an intensity that seems unnatural, likely the material component for a spell like Gate. 
### Hairpins and Combs
After rings, the next largest collection in the hoard is a set of 6000 hairpins and combs. Most of these are simply made from ivory (2000) or bone and horn (4000), usually with decorations and designs. About one-tenth of these (600) are more elaborate, set with fairly common gems. 

Value:
- Plain bone or horn: 5-100 sp, depending on the quality of the work.
- Plain ivory: 10-500 sp, depending on the quality of the work.
- Elaborate: 5-100 gp, depending on gemstone settings, mostly. 

Volume:
- 300 hairpins/combs per cubic foot

Examples:
- **An Ivory Comb with Carvings of Flowers and Vines**: This comb features intricate engravings that capture the essence of nature. It feels smooth and elegant in the hand, with each detail beautifully rendered.
- **A Silver Hairpin**: Decorated with numerous small turquoise beads set among an the silver metalwork of waves. 
### Earrings
Ra'ghemdros seemed to have a particular fascination with earrings, and this part of the hoard seems particularly complete and well preserved, showing signs of regular cleaning and even repair. There are 5000 pairs of earrings in the hoard, with a particular emphasis on higher quality works; about one-quarter (1250) are more elaborate, often set with gemstones or featuring delicate metalwork. There are also on display about 100 particularly elaborate earrings, typically either hoop designs that highlight a gemstone, or featuring clusters of metalwork and small gems. 

Value:
- Typical earrings: 5 sp - 250 sp, depending on the quality and workmanship
- Higher quality earrings, gold earrings: 5-100 gp, depending on quality and size
- Elaborate pieces: 100 gp and up. 

Volume:
- 1400 earrings per cubic foot, on average.

Examples:
1. **A Pair of Lapis and Gold Drop Earrings**: The lapis are cut and polished into spheres, each hanging from an intricately wrought golden vine, resembling ripe fruit. 
2. **A Set of Silver Hoops with Garnet Pendants**: Each earring has a smooth garnet shaped like a droplet.
