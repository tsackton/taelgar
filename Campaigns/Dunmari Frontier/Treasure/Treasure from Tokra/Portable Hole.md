### Portable Hole

A gift from [[Basu]], in exchange for helping clear the excess extraplanar energy from the [[Elven Arborea Workshop]] beneath the [[Lakan Monastery]], permeated with the essence of [[Arborea]]. 

Received in [[Session 42 (DuFr)]], from [[Basu]], with four rules:
1) never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal; 
2) no fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 
3) be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 
4) don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane.
