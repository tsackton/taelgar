Can, according to [[Seeker]]’s identity spell, somehow “bring the plane of [[Pandemonium]] closer to Taelgar”. Taken from [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] lair. Runes wiggle and squirm when trying to look at them, and caused mild nausea and confusion.

Looked at in [[The Mirror of the Past]]: [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision]]

Traded to [[Fausto]] as part of the deal for [[Hralgar's Eyes]]. Kept by [[Fausto]] when he betrayed the party.
