# Hralgar's Eyes
>[!info]+ Information  
> (magical wonderous item)  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

A pair of giant eyes, made of stone. These are two stone eyes, a bit smaller than a human head, and very heavy. They are exquisitely and realistically carved to resemble the eyes of a giant. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
These eyes were taken from the statue of Hralgar in [[Stormcaller Tower]], by [[Dee Wildcloak]], [[Dain Goldhammer]], and [[Alban]], on a mission funded by [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]] for the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], in DR 1748. They were kept in Fausto's tower in [[Chardon]] for several months, in until they were [[Session 48 (DuFr)|recovered]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. Eventually, they were returned to [[Hralgar]] as [[Session 71 (DuFr)|part of the process of freeing him from his bonds]].
