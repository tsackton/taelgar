**This is a partial copy of a copy of a report written by a Dunmari scholar based in Kharsan during the Aatmaji Dynasty, apparently based in part on a Drankorian treatise on urban form and urban planning. Nuzkar's annotations are in italics**

*I have not been able to reconstruct the full report, much less the original text, as too many pages are missing. However, it seems that prior to attacking Drankor, the Nayan Aatmaji Dasa sought as much information as possible and hoped that at least a partially accurate map of Drankor could be produced. I have reproduced as much of the Dunmari map as I could, with annotations.*
