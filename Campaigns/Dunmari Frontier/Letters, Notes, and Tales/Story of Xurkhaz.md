Loremaster [[Azogar]] tells this history of [[Xurkhaz]]. He speaks with a clear but wavering voice, and he says:

"Our history is no secret. You have not heard of us because we do not wish to be known widely, but it is not hidden. It was eight generations ago, when [[Uzgash]], hero and warrior traveling in these lands, recovered what was ours: the rainbow cloak. For years, generations, we had wandered, for we could not build, could not settle. It wasn't safe - our chained brethren learned of our hidden places, and hunted us. 

But [[Uzgash]] found this treasure of our people, hidden in the desert, lost in the wars, and slowly word went out, to all the [[People of the Rainbow]]: travel through Cha'mutte's deathlands, find their way here, where we can be safe. And we have grown and stayed hidden ever since. 

We have fought many wars, keeping our borders safe. The chained ones sometimes find us still. and all must be slaughtered or freed, or we risk our very civilization.""
