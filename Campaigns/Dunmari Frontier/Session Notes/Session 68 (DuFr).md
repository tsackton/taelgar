## Narrative

We begin as the party meets again, all together after a long absence. Everyone returns from their adventures changed, more or less, and eager to be reunited. Over the campfire, the party tells their stories. 

![[lastlight-falls-dunmar-side.png|600]]

[[Delwath]] speaks of how he [[Session 53 (DuFr)|found himself]] in the Deno’qai forests in the far north, a land once known as the [[Forest of Dreams]], but now called the [[Forest of Nightmares]] as it was cursed during the [[Great War]] against Cha’mutte. Traveling with the [[Stoneborn]] paladin [[Aristaea]] Mountainhands, and the Deno’qai wildfire druid [[Iascaire]], Delwath sought to  [[Session 54 (DuFr)|restore the lost tanshi]] trapped by Cha’mutte’s evil on  [[Session 55 (DuFr)|the battlefields]] of the Great War.

[[Riswynn]] speaks of her adventures, and apologizes for vanishing. After grabbing the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], she found herself in [[Heart of the Mountain]], the realm of the dwarven gods. Here, she met other [[Dwarves]] summoned to fulfill a debt to the Barahzel: [[Thror]] Redpeak, a storm sorcerer; [[Rothfis]] Stonefist, a bartender and monk;  and [[Merash]] Emberfoot, a smith and warrior. Together,  [[Session 56 (DuFr)|they investigated]] the Shadowfell realm of Morkalan and  [[Session 58 (DuFr)|uncovered]] the tragic story of the loss of the Chalice in the years after the Great War.

[[Kenzo]] speaks of [[Session 57 (DuFr)|his time]] in the jungles of the [[Lizardfolk]], far to the east, in the [[Lizardfolk]] kingdom of [[Orekatu]]. Here, he learned about the spiritual realms from the spirit guide [[Elazar]], who told him of a place, called the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], where the borders between planes are thin. With the [[Lizardfolk]] druid Izarrak and their guide, [[Enari]], [[Kenzo]] traveled [[Session 59 (DuFr)|to the Footprint of the Gods]] to seek out whatever was disrupting the balance of the planes and allowing destructive elemental power to spill into Taelgar, and [[Session 64 (DuFr)|restored harmony and balance]] by healing the wounded spirit creature Motua.

[[Wellby]] found himself on the [[Wave Dancer]], a [[Halflings|halfling]] ship in the middle of [[Green Sea]], [[Session 60 (DuFr)|fleeing from hobgoblin pirates]]. Eventually docking at the kenku port of [[Wahacha]] in the [[Vermillion Isles]], part of the vast, magical chain of islands that separate [[Green Sea]] from the [[~Eastern Ocean~]], [[Wellby]] met up with the wizard [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] Novolozek, the kenku monster hunter [[Rufus]], the sea [[Elves]] warrior [[Shoal]], and the human sailor and warrior [[Alimash]] to  [[Session 62 (DuFr)|seek out raiders]] who had been kidnapping people from ships in the area. After solving that mystery, [[Wellby]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] headed north to  [[Session 66 (DuFr)|rescue the wizard]] [[Arryn|Arryn the Wanderer]], who had vanished from his tower while experimenting with the magic of the Plane of Mirrors.

[[Seeker]] [[Session 61 (DuFr)|found himself]] in the [[Feywild]], in the [[Fortune's Rest|domain of the Chanceweaver]], the [[Prince of Luck]]. At the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court, he learned of a wild magic storm on the border of Fortune’s Rest and [[Shimmersong]], and travels with [[Raven]], a fae monk of the Winter Knights of [[Shimmersong]]; [[Spirala]] Hollytwist a fairy cleric of the light, also of [[Shimmersong]]; and [[Mikasa]], a fae samurai to [[Session 63 (DuFr)|calm the wild magic]]. After doing so, [[Mikasa]] departs for her home, while [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Seeker]] meet the human warrior [[Caulaus]] Aportino who [[Session 65 (DuFr)|guides them to the fey crossing]] at Lastlight Falls in the ruined abandoned fey realm of Amberglow.

During the conversation, the party reads letters from [[Tokra]] and elsewhere, and [[Delwath]] reports on the information he has learned from scrying in [[Scrying Delwath Oct 21|mid October]], [[Scrying Delwath Oct 26|late October]], and [[Scrying Delwath Nov 15|mid November]], and from a [[Interlude (Delwath Postscript)#Dunmar Rumors|week spent on the plains of Dunmar]]. The key facts include:
- [[Dunmar]] is on the bring of civil war: [[Nayan Karnas]] has seemingly not spoken to [[Johar]]; [[Havdar]] is turning bloodthirsty under the sway of a cursed sword; and the Lakan monks have not done anything yet.
- [[Kadmos]] and company, now traveling with a subdued [[Vola]] (whether due to mundane or magical coercion is not entirely clear), are crossing [[Dunmar]].
- [[Grash]] is preparing to march east, and soon, with a large army of [[Orcs]] and undead, presumably to recover the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] which was, according to [[Govir]]'s research, lost in a fortification of the [[Aagir Mystai]] to the east during the [[Great War]]. 
- A man in [[Ursk]] named [[Radomir]] found a [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], and it is now apparently in the possession of someone or something called Rodnya Voknaz.

The party decides to first try to restore [[Hralgar]], and then likely head east to attempt to beat [[Grash]] to the [[Cloak of Rainbows]].

We end late at night, as the party prepares to look in the mirror and then sleep.
