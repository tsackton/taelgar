## Narrative

We begin as the party meets again, all together after a long absence. Everyone returns from their adventures changed, more or less, and eager to be reunited. Over the campfire, the party tells their stories. 

![[lastlight-falls-dunmar-side.png|600]]

[[Delwath]] speaks of how he found himself in the Deno’qai forests in the far north, a land once known as the [[Forest of Dreams]], but now called the [[Forest of Nightmares]] as it was cursed during the [[Events/1500s/Great War]] against Cha’mutte. Traveling with the [[Stoneborn]] paladin [[Aristaea]] Mountainhands, and the Deno’qai wildfire druid [[Iascaire]], [[Session 51-52 (DuFr)|Delwath sought to restore the lost tanshi trapped by Cha’mutte’s evil on the battlefields of the Great War.]]

[[Riswynn]] speaks of her adventures, and apologizes for vanishing. After grabbing the  the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], she found herself in [[the Heart of the Mountain]], the realm of the dwarven gods. Here, she met other [[Dwarves]] summoned to fulfill a debt to the Barahzel: [[Thror]] Redpeak, a storm sorcerer; [[Rothfis]] Stonefist, a bartender and monk;  and [[Merash]] Emberfoot, a smith and warrior. Together, they [[Session 53-54 (DuFr)| investigated the Shadowfell realm of Morkalan and uncovered the tragic story of the loss of the Chalice in the years after the Great War.]]

[[Kenzo]] speaks of his time in the jungles of the [[Lizardfolk]], far to the east, in the [[Lizardfolk]] kingdom of [[Orekatu]]. Here, he learned about the spiritual realms from the spirit guide [[Elazar]], who told him of a place, called the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], where the borders between planes are thin. With the [[Lizardfolk]] druid Izarrak and their guide, [[Enari]], [[Kenzo]] [[Session 55-56 (DuFr)|traveled to the Footprint of the Gods to seek out whatever was disrupting the balance of the planes and allowing destructive elemental power to spill into Taelgar, and restored harmony and balance by healing the wounded spirit creature Motua.]]

[[Wellby]] found himself on the [[Wave Dancer]], a [[Halflings|halfling]] ship in the middle of [[Green Sea]], [[Session 57-58 (DuFr)#Prequel|fleeing from hobgoblin pirates]]. Eventually docking at the kenku port of [[Wahacha]] in the [[Vermillion Isles]], part of the vast, magical chain of islands that separate [[Green Sea]] from the Endless Ocean, [[Wellby]] met up with the wizard [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] Novolozek, the kenku monster hunter [[Rufus]], the sea [[Elves]] warrior [[Shoal]], and the human sailor and warrior [[Alimash]] [[Session 57-58 (DuFr)#Session 1|to seek out raiders who had been kidnapping people from ships in the area.]] After solving that mystery, [[Wellby]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] headed north [[Session 57-58 (DuFr)#Session 2|to rescue the wizard Arryn the Wanderer, who had vanished from his tower while experimenting with the magic of the Plane of Mirrors]].

[[Seeker]] [[Session 59-60 (DuFr)#Prequel|found himself in the Feywild, in the domain of the Chanceweaver]], the [[Prince of Luck]]. At the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court, he learns of a wild magic storm on the border of Fortune’s Rest and [[Shimmersong]], and travels with [[Raven]], a fae monk of the Winter Knights of [[Shimmersong]]; [[Spirala]] Hollytwist a fairy cleric of the light, also of [[Shimmersong]]; and [[Mikasa]], a fae samurai [[Session 59-60 (DuFr)#Session 1|to calm the wild magic]]. After doing so, [[Mikasa]] departs for her home, while [[Raven]], [[Spirala]], and [[Seeker]] meet the human warrior [[Caulaus]] Aportino [[Session 59-60 (DuFr)#Session 2|who guides them to the fey crossing at Lastlight Falls in the ruined abandoned fey realm of Amberglow]].

During the conversation, the party reads letters from [[Tokra]] and elsewhere, and [[Delwath]] reports on the information he has learned from scrying in [[Scrying Delwath Oct 21|mid October]], [[Scrying Delwath Oct 26|late October]], and [[Scrying Delwath Nov 15|mid November]], and from a [[Session 51-52 (DuFr)#Dunmar Rumors|week spent on the plains of Dunmar]]. The key facts include:
- [[Dunmar]] is on the bring of civil war: [[Nayan Karnas]] has seemingly not spoken to [[Johar]]; [[Havdar]] is turning bloodthirsty under the sway of a cursed sword; and the Lakan monks have not done anything yet.
- [[Kadmos]] and company, now traveling with a subdued [[Vola]] (whether due to mundane or magical coercion is not entirely clear), are crossing [[Dunmar]].
- [[Grash]] is preparing to march east, and soon, with a large army of [[Orcs]] and undead, presumably to recover the [[Mantle of Protection]] which was, according to [[Govir]]'s research, lost in a fortification of the [[Aagir Mystai]] to the east during the [[Events/1500s/Great War]]. 
- A man in [[Ursk]] named [[Radomir]] found a piece of [[Rai]]'s [[Jade]], and it is now apparently in the possession of someone or something called Rodnya Voknaz.

The party decides to first try to restore [[Hralgar]], and then likely head east to attempt to beat [[Grash]] to the [[Mantle of Protection]].

We end late at night, as the party prepares to look in the mirror and then sleep.
