## Halfling Rescue

  

The party entered a prison complex where they communicated telepathically with Milo Thistlefoot, a captured halfling. Delwath used his ghostly gaze to look inside a hut, seeing a Murfolk scholar working with bound elementals and sorting pictographs and mosaics. These pictographs depicted alien whirlpools and strange forms, possibly names of places or beings.

  

Milo recounted his transformation into a half-shark creature and how his crew was captured by Murfolk warriors while exploring the city of Omi. The party approached the cells holding the transformed halflings and a spellcaster named Tilly. Seeker considered using Dispel Magic to free Tilly first. The DM confirmed the prisoners were unguarded but protected by a barrier.

  

Wellby noted they had two doses of Breathe Water potions. Riswynn suggested coordinating with Seeker to get Tilly out first. Seeker cast Dispel Magic on Tilly, transforming her back to her halfling form and giving her a potion to breathe underwater. Tilly thanked the party and inquired about their identities and goals. Wellby explained they were there to rescue the halflings and mentioned potential combat on the way out.

  

The DM described the cells and asked the party's plan for getting past the barrier. Seeker cast Dispel Magic on the barrier, allowing the group to pass through it briefly. Tilly suggested they could manage to get everyone through the barrier in one go. The DM described Milo’s transformation back to his halfling form and his gratitude for being freed. Milo expressed surprise at the party's prowess and mentioned the excavation of a mural depicting the history of a sentient ocean.

  

Tilly mentioned the crew's attempt to escape, thwarted by a tentacled creature. Riswynn asked if the halflings could escape in their shark forms and agreed to keep them transformed for now. Seeker planned to use Dispel Magic and a potion to help the group breathe underwater. Tilly suggested using the Rainbow Bridge to get everyone to the flying castle. The DM confirmed the Rainbow Bridge was a viable escape route but mentioned a final task before using it.

  

Wellby indicated they needed to handle something important before leaving. Riswynn explained the plan to disrupt Baruli’s control and then leave via the Rainbow Bridge. Seeker coordinated the group to move quickly and quietly towards their objective.

  

## Traveling The Plane of Water

  

The party traveled for approximately two hours on manta rays since leaving the portal platform. Kenzo's magical sensing was precise in direction but vague in distance, estimating the jade to be 10 to 80 miles away. The group discussed their depleted resources, with Seeker noting limited spell slots and Delwath mentioning they recently took a short rest. Tilly offered to cast 'Commune with Nature' as a ritual to gain insight about their surroundings.

  

The DM described the party traveling through dark ocean waters, moving diagonally away from the portal and the work complex, starting to see signs of life like glowing phosphorescent fish. Tilly completed the 'Commune with Nature' ritual, choosing to sense for powerful beings, influences from other planes, and buildings.

  

The party encountered a massive, shadowy creature swimming below them, not noticing them. The creature was about 200-300 feet long, with many fins and a gigantic tail. Kenzo continued to sense the jade, realizing they were within 10 miles of it after around six hours of travel. Tilly periodically re-casted 'Commune with Nature' every half hour to stay aware of any nearby threats or structures. The DM confirmed no buildings sensed yet, indicating they were still too far away.

  

Riswynn considered summoning a celestial ally as they approached the jade, timing it to coincide with Tilly’s warning when they were within three miles. The party continued their journey, anticipating a potential confrontation and strategizing on how to handle it.

  

## Approaching the Temple of Gazankoa

  

The DM described the party’s underwater journey approaching the dark, cold depths with no marine life in sight. Tilly used 'Commune with Nature' and sensed a structure three miles ahead, with powerful magic at its center. The party discussed details of the structure, learning it was one large building with smaller structures around it, densely inhabited but not a city. Kenzo felt the jade fragment's presence and suggested using clairvoyance to scout the area.

  

Seeker used his last 4th-level spell slot with his glove of crystallized magic to cast clairvoyance. Clairvoyance revealed the jade within a whirlpool, mounted on a vibrating shell, surrounded by a large chamber resembling a rib cage. The chamber had bone-like barriers and was guarded by tired-looking merfolk guards. Seeker heard a strange chant or prayer near the whirlpool but couldn't make out any specific events.

  

The party concluded they needed to get close to the jade to retrieve it, discussing strategies including teleportation and control water. Riswynn summoned a celestial quaddle to aid them, advising it to shift into a water-breathing form. The party approached closer, saw a giant leviathan skeleton structure, and noted the patrol and guard positions. They planned to use the quaddle, transformed into a giant octopus, to create a distraction.

  

The octopus created an ink cloud, drawing the patrol and some guards away, leaving fewer guards at the mouth of the leviathan skeleton. With most guards distracted, the party decided to make a dash for the eye sockets of the skeleton to gain entry.

  

## Infiltrating the Temple

  

The party discussed their approach as they dashed towards the temple, riding manta rays. The DM described the scene: the party approached within 60 feet and spotted an open door leading into the main hall; a lone guard stood outside, not noticing them. Delwath cast 'Sleep' on the guard, successfully putting him to sleep, allowing the party to dash through the eye of the leviathan skeleton.

  

The DM noted that the octopus (distraction) was swimming back towards the party. Tilly discussed having the octopus dismiss itself into the darkness and then sneak back to their position in a smaller form. The party was inside the jaw of the leviathan skeleton, noticing flicks of light beyond and a cracked open door made of polished coral; they remained unnoticed.

  

The party planned to peer through the door; Delwath suggested Wellby, the rogue, do it stealthily. The DM described a cavernous room beyond the door with a whirlpool, merfolk guards, and Baruli, who was off his throne, listening to another merfolk explaining an incident. The party debated their next steps, considering casting spells and the element of surprise.

  

Delwath suggested casting 'Sickening Radiance' as an initial spell to disrupt the enemies; Tilly and the others planned a combo attack using 'Control Water'. Seeker contemplated using his magical goggles to inspect the whirlpool but decided against it due to the risk of being noticed. The party finalized their plan: Tilly cast 'Control Water' while Delwath prepared to cast 'Sickening Radiance'.

  

Riswynn and Seeker discussed immunity to 'Sickening Radiance'; Delwath and Riswynn decided who should be immune. The DM described the setup for the spell: Delwath cast 'Sickening Radiance' covering the whirlpool and a significant portion of the room. Milo spoke to the crowd of sharks, instructing them to keep the door secure and prepare to make a run for the Rainbow Bridge when signaled. The party prepared for combat, with blessings cast and positioning finalized, ready to engage the enemies.

  

## The Fight Against Buruli: Dire Darkness

  

The party prepared for combat with Baruli and his minions. Milo began combat with a quicksilver strike, injuring a merfolk guard. Wellby used 'steady aim' to kill a merfolk chanting near the whirlpool. Baruli cast a magical darkness, plunging part of the room in pitch black. Seeker dispelled the magical darkness using a clutch 'Dispel Magic' with assistance from a 'Mode of Fate' granted by the centers of Tagar.

  

Kenzo rushed through the whirlpool, taking 17 points of fire damage, and retrieved the jade embedded in a conch shell. Kenzo experienced a momentary illusion of being surrounded by enemies but was reassured by Seeker's voice. Kenzo became grappled and restrained by tentacles, taking 12 points of bludgeoning damage. Tilly used 'Control Water' to counteract the whirlpool and allow Kenzo to pass through safely.

  

The party strategized the best way to escape, with some readying actions and planning to use the Rainbow Bridge. The plesiosaur summoned by Riswynn engaged Baruli in melee combat but didn't manage to swallow him. One of Baruli's captains blew a magical horn, sounding an alarm. Delwath used 'Synaptic Static' to damage and debilitate several enemies, including minions and non-minions. Kenzo was poised to escape after retrieving the jade, despite being restrained by tentacles.

  

## The Escape to Vindristjarna

  

Wellby attempted to help Kenzo escape from tentacles but was unable to do so directly. Kenzo suggested cutting the tentacles, and the DM confirmed this was an option. Wellby checked his pockets for the captain's amulet, rolled a d4, but did not find it. Wellby decided to steal the amulet from an enemy, performed a sleight of hand check, and tied in the contested roll. Kenzo used inspiration to ensure Wellby successfully retrieved the amulet, and Wellby placed it around Kenzo's neck. Kenzo made a successful Dexterity check to catch the amulet, causing the tentacles to part.

  

Baruli teleported next to the party, and it was now his turn. Baruli cast a spell on Kenzo, who took 32 points of necrotic damage. Two tentacle creatures attacked Kenzo, one hitting for 14 points of cold damage. Seeker activated the Rainbow Bridge using the planar prism. Kenzo disengaged and moved onto the Rainbow Bridge.

  

Riswynn cast Sacred Flame on Baruli, dealing 18 radiant damage, and stepped onto the Rainbow Bridge. Tilly summoned a draconic spirit to guard the bridge and then stepped through. Wellby attacked and killed a minion before stepping through the bridge. Milo took out two minions before stepping onto the bridge. Baruli charged the Rainbow Bridge and stepped through, but Tilly's draconic spirit dealt 13 damage to him. Baruli was shot by the ship’s icicle turret and killed.

  

The party managed to get the suffocating halfling sharks to safety by casting Water Breathing. Kenzo smashed the shell, revealing a jade piece and a metal object humming with residual planar energy. The party received a vision showing the location of the final jade piece in a jungle cave. The session concluded with the DM summarizing the imminent threats and the state of the world as the countdown to Apollyon's release continued.
