- Riswynn offers additional healing to bolster the party’s recovery efforts.

  

- **Exploring the Temple**:

- **Foreshadowing Apollyon’s Influence**:

- Riswynn hears faint, static-like echoes in her mind as the group descends, possibly an effect of Apollyon’s lingering magic.

- The Cheli Knight steps forward and, momentarily dominated by magic, begins chanting in Drankorian before breaking free of the influence.

  

- **Combat with Undead Minions**:

- As the party advances, spectral undead spirits rise from the sarcophagi, initiating combat.

- They decide to press on, leaving the side chamber unexplored for now.

  

- **Reaching the Lowest Level**:

- The party arrives at a narrow passageway lined with patterned obsidian flooring that glows with a sickly green light.

- The passage twists and turns, requiring single-file traversal.

- **Seeker’s Erupting Earth**:

- Seeker casts *Erupting Earth* at 6th level, creating difficult terrain and dealing significant damage to Apollyon, despite absorbing necrotic backlash.

  

- **The Glowing Orb**:

- The animated ladder picks up the glowing crystal orb from the bone table and attempts to smash it, but the orb’s magical integrity prevents destruction by force alone.

- The ladder instead carries the orb away from Apollyon, disrupting his focus.

  

- **Apollyon’s Villain Actions**:

- Apollyon commands Delwath to "die," but Delwath’s *Death Ward* activates, thwarting the attempt and unleashing radiant light that temporarily unsettles Apollyon.

### Scene 7: The Crown’s Legacy and Dilemmas

  

- **Reflecting on Victory and Next Steps**:

- Deliberation begins on whether the crown should be destroyed, hidden, or wielded to enact good.

  

- **Examining the Crown**:

- The crown is revealed to have transformed from its previous state into a fine silver tiara adorned with dwarvish runes, seven points for the Barzelle, and gemstone motifs of hammers and forges.

- The party uses a magical mirror to delve into the crown’s history and purpose.

  

- **Revealing the Crown’s History**:

- Through the mirror, the party witnesses the crown’s creation in the days of myth, where it formed as a remnant of the gods’ separation from the mortal plane.

- The crown’s legacy spans eons, showing both its role in empowering good and its use in acts of tyranny, including Apollyon’s rise and its earlier use in saving an island nation from annihilation.

- The crown’s power is revealed to adapt to its wielder’s intentions, making it both a tool of salvation and destruction.

  

- **Debating the Crown’s Fate**:

- The party’s perspectives diverge:

- **Delwath** argues for wielding the crown to bring peace and prosperity, seeing it as a missed opportunity if destroyed.

- **Kenzo** supports destruction, wary of its corrupting potential and the temptation of power.

- **Welby** leans towards removing the crown from existence, seeing it as a dangerous artifact that disrupts the natural flow of history.

- **Seeker** proposes entrusting the crown to a long-lived entity, such as a stone giant, to ensure its safekeeping for future generations.

- **Riswynn** considers acting as the crown’s steward, using it temporarily to address immediate crises before ensuring its ultimate safety.

  

- **The Mirror’s Insights**:

- The mirror reveals that the crown cannot be easily destroyed and may reform elsewhere if an attempt is made.

- It also suggests the crown’s purpose as a cosmic remnant, tied to the foundational energies of the universe.

  

- **Philosophical Discussions**:

- The party debates whether individuals should have the power to reshape the world or if such artifacts inherently lead to abuse.

- Delwath highlights the potential for good, arguing that refusing to wield the crown leaves it vulnerable to misuse by others.

- Welby counters that true justice cannot come from such an artifact, as it imposes a singular will over many.

- Kenzo emphasizes the importance of trust and responsibility, questioning whether any individual can wield the crown without succumbing to its influence.

  

- **Potential Solutions**:

- Destroy the crown and risk its reforming elsewhere.

- Entrust it to an NPC or long-lived entity who can safeguard it indefinitely.
