### Detailed Summary

#### The Tomb of Apollyon
- After Apollyon flees, the party regroups in the temple; Delwath, visibly shaken from his recent death, begins a *Prayer of Healing* to recover hit points and offer a short rest to the group.
- While Delwath and others recuperate, Wellby investigates the side chapels, finding monuments and incomplete memorials to Apollyon's rule and attempted ascension to godhood, as well as a loose floor tile concealing a staircase leading down to an undercrypt.
- Delwath employs *Ghostly Gaze* to scout beneath the floor, noting the undercrypt is filled with construction debris, tools, and partially completed artwork. Stairs lead further down from the undercrypt.
- The party pries open the concealed staircase and descends into the undercrypt, finding it pitch dark and littered with remnants of construction. The chalyte knight, who descends first, triggers a trap, which Riswynn dispels. 
- A scrying sensor appears, focused on the construct, indicating that Apollyon is aware of their movements.
#### The Sarcophagus Room
- The party descends into a 20x30-foot chamber lit by greenish *Continual Flame* torches along the walls, which are lined with carved iconography depicting worshippers kneeling in reverence.
- At the far end of the room, an open corridor reveals the tops of sarcophagi visible in the next area.
- The chalyte knight steps forward and, momentarily dominated by magic, begins  kneeling and chanting in Drankorian before breaking free of the influence.
- As the party advances, spectral undead spirits rise from the sarcophagi, initiating combat.
- Riswynn’s *Turn Undead* incinerates approximately two dozen minions, leaving about 15 remaining.
- Delwath and Kenzo work together to clear additional minions, while Wellby provides precision support with his bow.
- Several party members resist the call to worship Apollyon, while Delwath briefly succumbs before shaking off the effect.
- After the battle, the party inspects the sarcophagi and finds remnants of cremated remains.
- Riswynn and Wellby discover a staircase leading further down, indicating the next stage of their journey.

#### The Crypt and the Narrow Passageway
- The party descends another level to a small 15x15-foot room with stairs leading further down and a side corridor extending 40 feet into a larger chamber.
- The larger chamber contains two columns with chains and a sarcophagus, reminiscent of Delwath’s earlier scrying.
- The group debates exploring the side chamber versus continuing their descent to pursue Apollyon directly; they decide to press on, leaving the side chamber unexplored for now.
- The party arrives at a narrow passageway lined with patterned obsidian flooring that glows with a sickly green light.
- The passage twists and turns, requiring single-file traversal.
####  Apollyon’s Inner Sanctum
- At the end of the twisting corridor, the party steps into a large chamber with 15-foot vaulted ceilings.
- The room is illuminated by an eerie green light emanating from the walls and four rune-covered pillars, each inscribed with glowing greenish symbols.
- At the far end, Apollyon sits on a throne; opposite him is a a table made of bones bearing a glowing green crystal orb.
- Apollyon greets the party with mockery: "I've been waiting. Are you ready to surrender for the glory of Apollyon?"

#### The Final Battle Begins
- The party attacks. Kenzo activate Lengua's claw and attacks first, dealing a series of strikes but struggling against Apollyon’s shimmering force armor.
- Riswynn and Delwath prepare their spells and defensive measures while Seeker positions the construct strategically.
- Apollyon teleports across the room, avoiding Kenzo’s melee reach.
- He unleashes necrotic energy bolts targeting multiple party members, but several save successfully, minimizing the damage.
- Seeker casts *Erupting Earth* at 6th level, creating difficult terrain and dealing significant damage to Apollyon, despite absorbing the necrotic backlash as Apollyon twists and attempts to counter the magic.
- The animated ladder picks up the glowing crystal orb from the bone table and attempts to smash it, but the orb’s magical integrity prevents destruction by force alone.
- Apollyon commands Delwath to die, but Delwath’s *Death Ward* activates, thwarting the attempt and unleashing radiant light and the protection of the [[Bahrazel]], that temporarily unsettles Apollyon.
- Protective spirits emerge from the rune-covered pillars, forming a defensive barrier around Apollyon and absorbing attacks directed at him.
- Riswynn summons a radiant cylinder of light, dealing heavy damage to Apollyon while simultaneously healing allies.
- Kenzo uses unarmed strikes to exploit Apollyon’s weaknesses, landing critical hits that visibly shake him.
- Seeker uses a *Catapult* spell to hurl the glowing orb directly at Apollyon, dealing damage and disrupting his composure.
- Apollyon, though visibly wounded, unleashes a wave of canceling magic, limiting the party’s spellcasting and magical item use.

#### Apollyon's Last Stand
- Apollyon transforms into mist, retreating briefly. The glowing runes on the floor between the pillars fade, as energy surges back into Apollyon, restoring him to full health.
- The party continues their sustained assault, with Seeker forcing Apollyon to shatter a pillar to protect himself from another *Erupting Earth*, and Wellby striking true with his Skaer arrows.
- Kenzo lands several unarmed strikes, though Apollyon’s necrotic aura retaliates, causing significant damage.
- Apollyon retaliates by commanding necrotic tendrils to restrain party members.
- Apollyon’s teleportation keeps him elusive, but the party manages to corner him.
- Delwath channels divine energy of the tanshi into a critical smite, dealing massive damage to Apollyon in a single blow.
- Apollyon begins to visibly weaken, cracks forming on his body as his energy dissipates.
- In retaliation, Apollyon unleashing a wave of necrotic tendrils, that knock Seeker unconscious and nearly do the same to Riswynn. Apollyon commands the ladder to strike the unconscious Seeker, moving him closer to death.
- Kenzo delivers a series of unarmed strikes, weakening Apollyon significantly.
- Delwath lands the killing blow, a blast of eldritch force guided by celestial spirits. Apollyon’s body disintegrates into moonlight, and the remaining pillars collapse.
#### Aftermath and Reflection
- As Apollyon fades, the sanctum begins to crumble. The party must escape while ensuring no one is left behind in the chaos. Seeker, revived by Delwath's *Healing Word*, teleports the party and the ladder (carrying the glowing orb) to the main level of the temple. 
- The group searches for any signs of remaining threats or allies. They confirm no immediate danger remains; Kenzo uses his ki sense to ensure no undead presence lingers within the temple.
- The party waits for several days, as the walls of Apollyon's prison, now binding them to the temple, weaken and fall. 
- During the wait in the temple, the party communicates with Sura in Dunmar, and with various Chardonians via the Crown of Purity. 
	- In Dunmar, the Chardonian army is retreating from Songara, but the Chardonian navy has won a great victory outside Darba, and [[Mitus Verina Auratan]] has entered the city. 
	- Negotiations are underway with [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]] about the fate of the Nayan Floodplains and the city of Darba. 
	- In Chardon, the chalyte trade is seeing signs of disruption, with strikes and sabotage spreading across Chardon.
- Riswynn remains attuned to the crown, using its influence to push back against the chalyte trade and ensure peace between Dunmar and Chardon. 
- Concerns about the crown’s long-term impact resurface, with the party agreeing to revisit its fate after they regroup.
- On the morning of May 30th, as the prison cracks open, the party uses the Rainbow Bridge to return to Vindristjarna. 
#### The Crown’s Legacy and Dilemmas
-  On Vindristjarna, the group greats their crew and discusses the implications of their victory over Apollyon, focusing on what to do with the crown.
- Deliberation begins on whether the crown should be destroyed, hidden, or wielded to enact good.
- The crown, removed from the [[Portable Hole]], has transformed from its previous state into a fine silver tiara adorned with dwarvish runes, seven points symbolizing the [[Bahrazel]], and gemstone motifs of hammers and forges.
- The party uses a magical mirror to delve into the crown’s history and purpose, seeing the [[Crown of Purity Vision]]
- Debating what to do next with the crown, the party’s perspectives diverge:
	- **Delwath** argues for wielding the crown to bring peace and prosperity, seeing it as a missed opportunity if destroyed.
	- **Kenzo** supports destruction, wary of its corrupting potential and the temptation of power.
	- **Wellby** leans towards removing the crown from existence, seeing it as a dangerous artifact that disrupts the natural flow of history.
	- **Seeker** proposes entrusting the crown to a long-lived entity, such as a stone giant, to ensure its safekeeping for future generations.
	- **Riswynn** considers acting as the crown’s steward, using it temporarily to address immediate crises before ensuring its ultimate safety.
- The party decides to delay a final decision, acknowledging the weight of their choice and the potential consequences.
- Riswynn continues to hold the crown, while the group prepares to explore future paths and consult allies for guidance.
