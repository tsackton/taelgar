## Narrative

Our session begins beneath the shattered tower of Red Sun Key, where the party stood within a radiant hall illuminated by Riswynn’s conjured sunlight. The room, now filled with echoes of sunset and shifting reflections, cast forth visions—the ancient towers lined against the ever-twilight border, the drifting Cloud Palace, and the Prismwell: a swirling pyramid of cloud and color, its basin brimming with liquid radiance. 

With the keep above cloaked in oppressive, physical darkness and a dread entity still channeling shadows from Hollowdark, the companions weighed their escape. Riswynn, Seeker, Kenzo, and Delwath prepared magical flight; Seeker cast a telepathic bond for coordination, and Riswynn shielded Wellby with a Death Ward and fresh healing. The four then vanished via Dimension Door, reappearing at their camp where Valeris the satyr and the griffins waited.

Wellby, left behind and protected by spellcraft, sped alone through the halls, pressed in by unnatural gloom and the flicker of unseen terrors. Guided by his boots of speed and his sharp wits, he raced to the roof, where swarming darkness tried to seize him. Shadowy hands erupted from below; Wellby dodged their grasp, even as necrotic energies struck him silent. Still, with one last desperate burst, he burst free, and landed amidst his allies outside the keep, as new winged horrors began to stir in the distant shadows.

After escaping the supernatural darkness, the party gathers and swiftly resaddles their mounts—three griffins and a wyvern. Their task is clear: to reach the Prismwell, a legendary site now hidden by an immense, inverted tornado of cloud, summoned by lighting a beacon. Yet, its location is unknown, and the Feywild landscape stretches before them, mysterious and shifting. Wellby conjures a magical arrow, fires it into the sky, and a shimmering trail of sunset-lit footprints guides them southwest.

Mounting up, the group follows the trail, but soon spot three vast shadow beasts winging after them in relentless pursuit. Realizing these foes are steadily gaining, the party devises a plan. Rizwynn uses her dwarven rune to cast Longstrider on the wyvern and two griffins, granting them bursts of speed. Seeker and Riswynn, with their griffins, become invisible and break away, hoping to scatter the pursuers.

The wyvern distracts the shadows with a dramatic aerial display while the others streak ahead. The ruse succeeds—the shadow creatures fixate on the wyvern and lose track of the invisible members. Seeker and Riswynn later transform themselves and their griffins into sparrows, completely blending into the local fauna for safety.

Those in the lead continue along the river, the land’s colors intensifying as they near their goal. Wargs and duskhounds attempt to intercept from below, but the party ascends, surging high above their range. At last, the clouds part to reveal the radiant pyramid of the Prismwell gleaming beneath them. The party descends, regrouping as all reach sanctuary before their pursuers can close in.

As the party gathered within the shifting wall of clouds, they weighed their options with little time to spare; distant hunters were surely closing in. Seeking to free the powerful being known as Cloudspinner, they decided to retrieve her crystalline prison from the depths of the portable hole. While initial attempts to physically invert the hole were discussed, Seeker instead used a telekinetic spell to carefully lift the heavy crystal from its confines. Once elevated, the shimmering prison was guided to hover over a pool of silvery, mist-like liquid.

With tense anticipation, Seeker released his magical hold, and the crystal prison dropped into the pool and vanished from sight. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Then, the sharp whistle of arrows cut through the clouds; two struck harmlessly against Riswynn’s armor and narrowly missed Kenzo as hostile archers emerged from hidden positions. Meanwhile, tendrils of blackness began encroaching at the cloud’s edge.

Riswynn advanced through featureless mist toward the sound of threatening creatures and, sensing the peril, unleashed a mighty Sunburst. Its brilliance cut through the haze, targeting the direction of the spectral howls. Delwath summoned a vigilant insect spirit to orbit defensively overhead. Kenzo reached out with his senses and discerned three shadowy beings pressing against the resistance of the cloud barrier, with a cluster of warg-mounted foes farther out, straining to force their way in.

The group braced for confrontation, eyes fixed on the pool where Cloudspinner had vanished.

As Riswynn unleashes a searing Sunburst against the looming shadow creatures, the unnatural clouds overhead ignite in light, burning away the tendrils of darkness that threatened to break through. Amidst the fading gloom, a figure descends: the Cloudspinner, ancient archfey and ruler of Amberglow, wreathed in clouds and blazing colors. Her arrival is marked by exhaustion and a shimmering intensity, her presence overwhelming in both power and sorrow for what has befallen her realm.

Seeker, overcome with reverence, kneels as the spirit of Lady Eventide departs. The Cloudspinner addresses the party, offering gratitude and a promise: they will always be welcome in Amberglow. With a gesture, she grants Wellby a shimmering, color-changing hat—an enchanted key allowing the party to return here by magic. 

Riswynn seeks counsel about the [[Crown of Purity]]. The Cloudspinner explains the need for a worthy purpose, that the crown’s bonds of domination can be unraveled only by dedicating it to a new cause. Riswynn, resolved to aid the oppressed orcs and foster new communities, places the crown on her head. Light flares out, severing countless bonds of control; a great burden lifts from her, while the crown’s shape settles into something more grounded and real.

The Cloudspinner answers questions about portals and passageways out of her domain, directing the party to known gateways. Parting words are exchanged, and with the Rainbow Bridge, the party returns to [[Vindristjarna]], reuniting with their crew and airship above the dusty plain. The session ends as the company regroups, ready to chart their next course.
