## Narrative

We begin as the day of deception passes, Dec 6th, during which the party tries to fool anyone scrying, convincing watchers that they have attempted to steal the [[Mantle of Protection]] from Chief [[Lubash]]. The day passes in fits and starts, until the party departs in false disgrace in the late afternoon. Camping in the desert, the party scries [[Hektor]], seeing him on a boat on the river, an uncertain distance away. After preparing for a battle with Hero's Feast, and sneaking back into the palace, the party passes a fitful night waiting for an attack that does not come.

The next morning, Dec 7th, the party stays hidden in the palace, waiting. [[Lubash]] brings bad news: the western border was attacked, with huge loss of life, and the fortress at Khumarz cannot hold back another assault of undead. The day passes. Two [[Orcs|orc]] warriors from the western front arrive, to provide more support for the coming battle with [[Kadmos]]. Day turns to night, as the party waits, tense.

Past midnight -- early in the morning on Dec 8th -- the attack begins with an undead assault on the city gates. While the palace guards rush off to protect the townsfolk, the party prepares for [[Kadmos]]' assault on [[Lubash]] and attempt to steal the cloak. Hiding in the bedrooms, the party waits until [[Delwath]]'s alarm is triggered, and launches their attack. [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance keeps the vanguard of [[Kadmos]]' crew at bay for a moment, although [[Wellby]] takes the brunt of ranged attacks, as he is initially the only easy target. As the fight proceeds, [[Kenzo]] pins down the large demonic creature commanded by [[Kadmos]] with his frightening strike, but [[Casian]] and [[Kadmos]] manage to dimension door into the room with [[Lubash]], and make a grab for the cloak, stopped only by [[Seeker]] dimension dooring away with [[Lubash]]. [[Hektor]] manages to barrel through the door and grab [[Lubash]] and the cloak, only to be stopped by [[Seeker]]'s irresistible curiosity spell, trapping him in [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance with [[Lubash]], who nearly dies from the spell. Still, even with the large warriors ([[Hektor]] and the demon) neutralized, [[Antonia]], [[Kadmos]], and [[Casian]] made to get away with the cloak, until [[Antonia]] was stopped by [[Riswynn]]'s wall of fire. Still, [[Casian]] and [[Kadmos]] nearly get away, stopped only by a clutch counterspell from [[Delwath]], stopping [[Casian]]'s final dimension door. 

With everyone barely alive, [[Delwath]] uses sleep to bring the enemies unconscious. The session ends as [[Kadmos]] is executed and the remaining prisoners are stripped of their gear and trapped in the mirror.
