### Detailed Summary
#### Contemplating the Path Ahead
- The party begins in the temple of the Eight Divines in Drankor as night falls. The holy aura of the temple protects them from the encroaching darkness of the city.
- The group reflects on their goal to destroy the phylactery by freeing the seven souls trapped within it.
- Seeker’s research confirmed that a connection to the Land of the Dead is required to unravel the phylactery’s magic. Physical mementos tied to each soul are crucial for this process.
- Four mementos have been secured: three death masks from the Chapel of the Father and a silver pen nib from [[Valanthe]]’s courtyard.
- The remaining targets are:
	- [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], a halfling tavern owner near the docks.
	- [[Khemut of Targu]], a foreign sailor or traveler likely connected to the docks.
	- [[Minarith]], an elf of the peronar lineage, with little information available.
- The party debates the logistics of entering the Land of the Dead:
	- Plane Shift requires the body of a recently deceased person whose soul resides in the Land of the Dead.
	- They consider potential sources of such a body, including cities like [[Tollen]] or sacrifices within Drankor.
	- Concerns are raised about resource management and the risks of “dying” as part of the plan.
	- The group prioritizes recovering the remaining mementos before finalizing their approach to the Land of the Dead.
- As dawn breaks, the party prepares for the day with another casting of *Heroes’ Feast*, granting temporary bonuses and protection against fear.
- The party sets their sights on the docks of Drankor, focusing on finding mementos tied to [[Seraphina Appleblossom]] and [[Khemut of Targu]]
- The phylactery (a dagger containing Apollyon’s soul) remains guarded by Wellby, who volunteers to stay behind.
#### A Haunted Path to the Docks
- The party navigates through the overgrown streets of Drankor, moving eastward from the temple district. The surroundings include crumbled stone buildings, vine-covered ruins, and the oppressive humidity of the jungle.
- The group arrives at a massive plaza dominated by a 30-foot-high arch covered in vines. Seeker briefly clears some vines, revealing a relief carving of Apollyon surrounded by a worshipful crowd, with rays of light emanating from his hands.
- In the plaza, the party notices a partially intact building with an unusual appearance, as though it had been partially consumed or eroded. Movement and a grinding sound emanate from its surface.
- Despite curiosity, the group uncharacteristically decides against investigating further, focusing on their primary objective.
- As the group continues southward, faint cries and pleas for help echo from the ruins along the road. The voices speak in various languages, including Common, Elvish, and Dwarvish, seemingly emanating from a specific building.
- They briefly debate investigating but ultimately decide to continue toward the docks, noting the voices for potential future exploration.
- The party encounters a group of approximately 35 shadowy undead emerging from the jungle ahead. Acting quickly, they use *Invisibility* to evade detection.
- The shades drift past without incident, allowing the group to continue their journey undisturbed.
- Now invisible and cautious, the party presses on toward the docks, intent on locating the next set of mementos.
#### The Laughing Wave
- The party reaches the docks area of Drankor, finding it overgrown and largely in ruins. Only the foundations of most buildings remain, with intact structures being rare.
- They identify the likely location of [[Seraphina Appleblossom]]’s tavern, "The Laughing Wave," marked by an archway with stone carvings of curling waves.
- Entering the tavern, the party notices an eerie mist filling the interior. The sunlight outside dims to a reddish hue.
- A twisted conglomeration of spirits, bound together and floating, dominates the space. The spirits’ presence emanates sorrow and unease.
- Despite their invisibility, the party’s movement draws the attention of the spirits, which separate into 20 individual entities and converge on the noise, starting a combat. Delwath casting *Synaptic Static*, destroying half the spirits; Kenzo uses precise attacks and aura strikes, stunning and eliminating multiple enemies; Riswynn invokes divine power to sear the undead, banishing many with radiant energy, and Seeker uses of *Erupting Earth* to further thin the enemy ranks.
- A larger, more solid entity, composed of conjoined spirits but invisible, rises from below. This entity emits psychic despair, causing damage and unsettling memories.
- Delwath’s *Sickening Radiance* reveals the entity to all, dealing significant radiant damage.
- Kenzo’s relentless attacks and Riswynn’s holy power ultimately destroy the greater spirit.
- Searching the tavern reveals a small, halfling-sized cooking pot, heavily scorched but intact. It radiates faint magic and is identified as a weak memento of [[Seraphina Appleblossom]].
- The group secures the cooking pot and prepares to continue their search for the remaining mementos, wary of further dangers lurking in the city.
#### Secrets in the Cellar
- The party searches through the rubble of "The Laughing Wave," uncovering a trapdoor to the cellar beneath the debris.
- Delwath also discovers fragments of a large painted punch bowl. Reassembling pieces reveals an artistic depiction of an ocean with colorful fireworks, indicating its use as a centerpiece in the tavern.
- The bowl is identified as decorative, with faint enchantments possibly preserving its paint. It resonates faintly with Seraphina’s essence, but Kenzo’s soul sense points to the cellar as the source of a stronger connection.
- Using *Mold Earth*, the party clears the trapdoor and descends into the cool, well-preserved cellar.
- They find remnants of rotted casks and a locked wooden chest, containing 1,000 silver coins and 80 gold coins, with a mix of Drankorian and foreign origins.
- Several coins bear the markings of Targu, tied to [[Khemut of Targu]]'s presence in the tavern.
- The cellar’s stone shelf holds decayed firework casings, strongly resonating with [[Seraphina Appleblossom]]’s soul.
#### Searching the Custom House
- With mementos for six of the seven souls secured, the party plans their next steps, considering whether to search further for stronger connections or proceed with the current items.
- Divination magic is cast to determine the viability of searching the Custom House and surrounding area. The response hints at promising clues tied to the peronar. 
- A short rest is taken to recuperate, with minor healing and abilities restored.
- The Custom House is a large, partially intact structure with a collapsed roof, overgrown with vegetation.
- The entrance features a grand archway leading into a cavernous interior that once served as a trade hub and record office.
- The group notes remnants of metal and glass, suggesting a once-opulent design.
#### The Red Mist and the Sealed Chest
- The party ventures deeper into the Custom House, encountering a large room with intact walls and shafts of light streaming through holes in the roof.
- The room is dominated by a swirling red mist, occasionally forming into ominous shapes, with a pile of bones and a strangely preserved wooden chest in the far corner.
- Sensing danger, the group debates whether to engage the mist or attempt to bypass it.
- Kenzo detects a faint connection to [[Khemut of Targu]] from the chest but no immediate link to [[Minarith]], the peronar..
- Delwath casts *Banishment* on the mist, successfully dispersing it temporarily.
- With the mist banished for one minute, the party acts quickly to investigate the chest.
- The chest is a large, magically preserved cabinet containing hundreds of scrolls.
- Kenzo locates a specific scroll tied to [[Khemut of Targu]], a shipping manifest for the ship *Selem Shurga*.
- Additional scrolls are hastily collected, focusing on those marked with sigils or other noteworthy details.
- As the mist begins to re-form, Kenzo and the others retreat from the room, taking approximately 100 scrolls with them.
- The red mist does not pursue them beyond the room.
- Among the scrolls are trade records and manifests providing insight into Drankor’s past commerce, including mentions of three major universities: the Imperial University, Valtrius University, and the University of the Blessed Waters (The Thalorian). But there is no mention of [[Minarith]].
- Kenzo senses a connection to [[Minarith]] still in the room with the red mist, and runs back to find it, dodging attacks from the creature, which has returned.
- Kenzo grabs the scroll and flees. The scroll references [[Minarith]], listed as a faculty member of the Thalorian, providing a crucial lead for the party.
- With key information secured, the party decides to return to the temple to regroup and prepare for their next move: locating the Thalorian and finding a memento of [[Minarith]].
