## Timeline

- (DR::1748-09-30), afternoon:  [[Seeker]] arrives in the [[Feywild]] realm of Fortune’s Rest
- **Afternoon, in the feywild**: [[Seeker]] travels to the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court; meets the [[Prince of Luck]]; agrees to investigate the wild magic storm in exchange for safe passage across the realm.

## Narrative

We begin as [[Seeker]] arrives in the [[Feywild]], in a meadow of flowers that bloom and unfurl into butterflies as their petals open, taking wing and blowing away. Getting his bearings, with the help of [[Typhina]] and the maps and notes of [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]], from [[Chardon]], [[Seeker]] stands trying to look confident in this strange place. A giggle from nearby turns out to come from a small fairy, a pixie, who warns [[Seeker]] he must have the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s permission to travel through his domain of [[Fortune's Rest]], and invites him to come to court, by way of polymorphing him into a dragonfly. 

The court itself is a vast, elegant outdoor casino, staffed by beautiful [[Fey]] in white robes, and filled with games of chance of all kinds. A band of satyrs plays a lively tune, and food and drink flow freely. [[Seeker]] wanders, avoiding food and drink and watching the games, until eventually watching a lizard race and deciding to bet. [[Seeker]] bets on one of the losers, and suffers an explosion of black sticky ooze in his face with a rancid, bitter taste as a consequence, but manages to avoid any more severe effects.

Eventually [[Seeker]] begins to wander towards the palace in the center of the gardens, although it seems difficult to leave the games and [[Seeker]] ends up wandering for some unknown stretch of time before finding himself in a formal garden just outside the palace. The flowers here do not have normal flowers, but rather dense lobes of light of burnished gold, glowing. Somewhat impulsively, [[Seeker]] reaches out and touches one, which bursts in a flash of light, blinding him.

A quick casting of dispel magic removes the blindness, but catches the attention of the [[Prince of Luck]]. The music stops, and he confronts [[Seeker]], but quickly forgives him, and asks him to come tell his story at court. After some back and forth, discussing what [[Seeker]] wants and where he came from, the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]] offers [[Seeker]] a chance to roll for his favor. [[Seeker]], in a moment of pure chutzpah, decides to use his magic dice to try to win, rolling two six sided dice for a total of thirteen. For a moment it seems as if the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]] will be angry, but then he decides to reward [[Seeker]] for his attempt. 

We end as [[Seeker]] rests in the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s court, after agreeing to help resolve the wild magic storm growing on the border of Fortune’s Rest, in exchange for safe passage across the [[Prince of Luck|Chanceweaver]]’s domain.
