## Narrative
We begin in the fey realm of [[Shimmersong]], where [[Raven]] and [[Spirala]] have brought [[Seeker]], in order for rest and also learn more about the fey crossing he is searching for. After spending some time in [[Shimmersong]], during which [[Seeker]] explored and spent time constructing a magical glove with the shards of crystalized magic to let him manipulate spells, the party has left for [[Amberglow]], where [[Lastlight Falls]] – the fey crossing [[Seeker]] is searching for – is located.

[[Amberglow]] is a decaying realm, in disrepair since the Queen of Sunsets, the archfey of [[Amberglow]], vanished many years ago. To travel there needs a guide, and [[Raven]] knows one: the strange human warrior [[Caulaus]] Aportino. 

[[Caulaus]] leads the party into [[Amberglow]], through the Golden Hills on the border of [[Amberglow]] and [[Shimmersong]], to Longshadow Ravine, the only clear path out of the hills into the plains of [[Amberglow]]. However, the ravine is guarded by a cursed giant with an evil glare, [[Vondar]] One-Eye, who the party later learns demands a toll of a memory to pass. Refusing to pay the toll, the party fights, trying to avoid the cursed eye. As the party wears the giant down, the combat seems to be going their way, until [[Seeker]] is cursed by [[Vondar]]’s glare. Nonetheless the party defeats the giant, removes the curse on [[Seeker]], and investigates the camp, wondering about the cauldron of bubbling memories. [[Seeker]] is nearly pulled into the cauldron before being dragged away by his friends, and the party realizes the better part of valor is not messing with strange fey things they don’t understand, and leave. 

Beyond the Golden HIlls and [[Vondar]]’s ravine is a vast expanse of open plains, presumably once beautiful in the evening light of sunset, now dry and pale. To find [[Lastlight Falls]], the first goal is to find the crashed Cloud Palace, where the [[Lady Eventide]], one of the few of the [[Cloudspinner]]’s court who remains in [[Amberglow]], resides. The palace is a wreck, twisted and broken and drained of color. [[Lady Eventide]] is wearing elegant dress and courtly jewelry, but her skin and nearly all her clothes and hair are bleached pale and colorless.

[[Lady Eventide]] and [[Caulaus]] speak about their apparent shared history, with the Lady telling [[Caulaus]] he cannot leave, and cannot be forgiven until the [[Cloudspinner]] returns, since it was her that [[Caulaus]] wronged. Until then, he must remain in the [[Feywild]]. Speaking with [[Seeker]], [[Lady Eventide]] asks what he will give in exchange for a way across the fey crossing at [[Lastlight Falls]]. Pale and colorless, she asks for the color of his beard, and eventually agrees to take instead a streak of color from his hair. In exchange, she gives him a [[Sunset Thread|thread]] from her dress, made by the [[Cloudspinner]], who as known for her way with spinning thread of magic from the colors of the sunset. 

The party is then told the way to proceed, past a line of trees that guard [[Lastlight Falls]], and to be careful not to touch the shadows of the trees. The party manages to move forward carefully, avoiding most of the dangers of the shadows, and passing through the trees to the sight of [[Lastlight Falls]]. 

We end as [[Raven]] leaves to return to the defense of [[Shimmersong]], and [[Spirala]], [[Seeker]], and [[Caulaus]] see on the top of the cliffs of [[Lastlight Falls]], [[Kenzo]] sitting and waiting.
