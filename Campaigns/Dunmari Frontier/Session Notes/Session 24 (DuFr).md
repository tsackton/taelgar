We begin as the party leaves the tower attached to the [[Hall of Stories]] in the evening, as the long shadows begin to stretch across the desert, heading to investigate the Temple of [[Bhishma]] at the [[Monastery of Bhishma|monastery]]. As they approach, [[Delwath]] sees a warning that no one else can sense, but despite the warning the party cautiously enters the temple. 

The entry chapel, dedicated to [[Five Siblings]], has been desecrated and looted, with little left to see or find. Uncertain of the situation, [[Kenzo]] reaches out his senses to detect the presence of good or evil, and notes that something undead is lurking about 20 feet below this room, but nothing ahead or in the side rooms. Continuing on to the main temple, the party finds it more intact, the high windows, now devoid of glass, letting in the evening sun and illuminating a large statue of [[Bhishma]], standing with her hands palm up in supplication. [[Kenzo]] senses more undead in a hallway to the left, and he and [[Delwath]] go to investigate, carefully. Catching only the barest flicker of shadowy movement as a patch of darker shadow detaches itself from the wall, [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] proceed with extreme caution, and eventually illuminate the hallway with [[Kenzo]]’s [[Driftglobe]], revealing three humanoid-looking shadows that retreat from the light. Deciding to retreat in the face of the coming night, the party leaves the temple and the shadows, and heads past the dead [[Orcs|orc]] bodies back to camp.

During the night, [[Delwath]] hears something, a distant clink of armor. As morning dawns, after some conversation about plans, [[Wellby]] sets out to investigate, and quickly discovers that the [[Orcs|orc]] prisoner and the dead bodies of his companions are gone, seemingly come back to life in some form. They have freed their commander and returned to base, upending the party’s developing plans for scouting.

After considering a variety of options, the party decides to turn south, and ride fast, not trying to hide their trail, but then cut west and north on the rockier terrain of the cliffs and canyons west of the now-dry [[Kharja]] river, to try to circle back towards [[Kharsan]]. Pushing hard and into the night, they seem to have lost the trail of the [[Orcs]] in the rocky lands to the west, as the night of May 12th is quiet in the desert.

Heading north, the party circles back to the old Dunmari road that cuts through the Samraat Tombs above the city. After hiding the horses with [[Seeker]]’s magical assistance, the party creeps east, to the old bridge, just under a mile fro the palace, with [[Delwath]] and [[Seeker]] traveling invisibly and [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] sneaking. Despite thinking they may have been spotted during the last desperate dash across 100 yards of open ground, the party gathers in the shelter of the bridge, seemingly safe. Here, [[Delwath]] goes to scout the city, and [[Seeker]] casts clairvoyance targeting the middle of the palace, seeing a [[Grash May 13th|vision of Grash]].

Meanwhile, [[Delwath]] is scouting the city, looking through the ruins of the northern part of [[Kharsan]]. Much has been destroyed here, either long ago, or more recently mined for stone to reconstruct the palace and the [[Orcs|orc]]’s fort to the south. As [[Delwath]] travels through the city, all is quiet save voices in the distance, speaking in Dunmari and calling for help, but seeming to never come nearer even when [[Delwath]] walks towards the sound. In his explorations, he finds some ruins from a glassblower’s shop, some old tools and shattered glasswork, that he brings back with him. 

We end as the party gathers, just before noon, in the shelter of the bridge, with a few minutes of invisibility left, ready to return to the horses and head west, back west out of the desert.
