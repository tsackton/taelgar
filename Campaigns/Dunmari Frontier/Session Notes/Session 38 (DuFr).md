## Narrative
Our session begins with a flashback to [[Govir]], hiding in the basement of the werewolves’ lair, [[Govir's Story|dwelling on the past month]]. 

We return to the adventurers as the party starts to search the bodies and the lair, and inspect their wounds. The search is interrupted by the sounds of something pounding against the door that [[Wellby]] barred shut, and then a crash as a wolf leaps through the window. The wolf is quickly followed by a woman, who starts to shift, and another wolf. As the battle is engaged, two [[Dwarves]] arrive, having been chasing the werewolves. One is a familiar face, [[Riswynn]] . The other is the retired adventurer and now innkeeper of [[The Iron Swan]], [[Vistra Fireforge]], wearing plate armor and carrying a giant maul. After a few moments the final werewolves are dispatched, with the aid of the newcomers.

In the aftermath of the battle the party learns that [[Riswynn]] came to [[Tokra]] after a group of merchants arrived in [[Tharn Todor]] and turned to werewolves, attacking the city. Once subdued and healed, the [[Dwarves]] learned they had been attacked by a pack of wolves outside [[Tokra]], and [[Riswynn]] traveled to investigate, meeting up with [[Vistra Fireforge]] in the city. After speaking with the Hardstones at the [[Archives]], they had learned the party was in town and tracked them down. 

The party searches the bodies and the papers, uncovering what seem to be calculations about the moon and calendars, as well as a key and what seems to be a prophecy written in an unknown language, that [[Delwath]] reads:

*When the sixth moon rises in the betrayer sky,*

*When the deepest echo of madness is nigh,*

*In the ancient cave of the [[Mad One]]'s soul.*

*Thirteen brethren, thirteen prayers,*

*Thirteen cold iron spears prepared,*

*Will bring forth the howl of empty despair.*

*And [[Jinnik]]'s curse will claim the land.*

While searching the lair, they also uncover a giant calendar painted on the wall of the master bedroom that seems to be counting down days until August 1st, the next full moon, and some scattered coins and trinkets. 

After [[Riswynn]] heals [[Kenzo]] of suspected lycanthropy, she goes with [[Wellby]] to search the basement again for whatever the leader’s key opens, while [[Vistra Fireforge]] keeps onlookers from getting curious and the rest of the party takes a short rest. In the basement, [[Wellby]] finds a secret door hidden by an illusory wall. Inside is a small room with a locked chest, and a table with a map spread out on it. As [[Wellby]] opens the chest, poison gas pours out. [[Riswynn]] jumps on the table to get above it, while [[Wellby]] dashes out of the room. After some debate about how to rescue [[Riswynn]] and get the stuff out of the chest, [[Delwath]] uses mage hand to pass the [[Raven Whistle]] to [[Riswynn]], letting her fly over the gas; [[Delwath]] also retrieves some items from the chest, including an [[Ivory Scroll Cap]] that looks very familiar. As the party regroups, they decide to excavate a pit for the gas to pool in in order to get the rest of the stuff from the chest. 

Finally, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, the party leaves the lair, [[Vistra Fireforge]] remaining behind on guard until [[Kaleha]] can be notified. [[Kenzo]] goes to speak with [[Kaleha]] to let her know of the events of the day, while the rest of the party escorts [[Govir]] back to the [[Archives]], where [[Riswynn]] cures him of his lycanthropy. 

[[Kaleha]] is shocked as she is not sure where the werewolves could have come from, given that anyone bearing [[Jinnik]]’s curse should have been turned away by [[Shakun's Protection]]. She speculates that [[Chardon]] is the source, perhaps unaware, or momentarily forgetting in her shock, that [[Shakun's Protection]] was inoperative for months. She relays rumors from a hundred years ago of werewolves in [[Tokra]], before the protections of [[Shakun]] were complete, and invites [[Kenzo]] to return for dinner with his companions. 

In the [[Archives]], the party regroups while [[Riswynn]] heals [[Govir]] and [[Delwath]] organizes the papers and notes in the strange language, not able to make much sense of them but translating them for [[Govir]] to interpret later. The notes on the prophecy are a bit clearer, in particular what seems to be someone’s note to themselves: “We must find a way past the Dunmari's maze, and we must find a way to get to the Dunmari city without attracting attention. Maybe the old witch can help, if I can find something to trade worthy of her.” The party also receives a copy of the letter that [[Servius]] found, from [[Ardan]]: [[Archives Letter]].

At dinner with [[Kaleha]], the conversation focuses on the werewolves, the old fort and the connection to [[Pandemonium]]. [[Kaleha]] vows to send guards to keep watch on the place, and the party also tentatively agrees to investigate on their way north. From [[Kaleha]], they also learn that the building the werewolves established as their lair was in the northern part of the city that was somewhat run down and abandoned, and now filled with refugees. She notes that if the city were not full of refugees, a large group of strangers probably would not have been able to set up a base unnoticed. 

As the dinner breaks up and the party goes to a well-deserved rest, they agree that they would tell [[Kaleha]] if they find anything, and turn in for the night, planning on awakening early in the pre-dawn light to search for signs of werewolves.
