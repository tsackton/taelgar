## Session Notes

### Prequel

We begin as [[Wellby]] lands, teleported from far away, onto the deck of the [[Wave Dancer]], a halfling trader making its way east, in the eastern half of [[The Green Sea]]. The [[Wave Dancer]] is fleeing hobgoblin pirates from the Devil’s Spine, unwilling to give over their cargo of dragon hide from [[Praznitsky]], and hoping for cover of darkness to slip away. [[Wellby]] uses the [[Raven Whistle]] to fly back towards the hobgoblin ship, where despite the constant hail of arrows, he manages to land on the crow’s nest, kill the sailor there, and, while obscured by the smoke from his pyrotechnic arrow, set the mainsail on fire. Although the [[Hobgoblins]] get the fire under control quickly, the sail is done for and the pirate ship slows enough to allow the [[Wave Dancer]] – aided by magical fog created by the navigator, [[Corrin Wildheart]] – to escape in the night. 

Over the next 10 days, as the [[Wave Dancer]] makes it way to the kenku port of [[Wahacha]] in the eastern isles, [[Wellby]] talks with the halflings on the ship. He tells his tale, and listens to stories of the halflings. They tell of [[Praznitsky]], a closed city in the north, part of the country of Ursk, where none are allowed across the bridge from the harbors and warehouses to the main city, and the people trade dragon hide. They tell [[Medju]], the great spice city in the south, the terminus of trade routes from strange lands across the desert, where you can buy and sell almost anything in the markets of  the obscenely wealthy spice lords. They tell of the anchored island, [[Quanyi]], where sea [[Elves|elves]] live and harvest magical salt from the warm tropical oceans on their shores. And they tell of [[Wahacha]], their destination, a small port in the [[Vermillion Isles]], inhabited by kenku since time immemorial.

We end as the [[Wave Dancer]] arrives in [[Wahacha]], and [[Wellby]] is given a tour of the island by [[Makha]], the harbor master and unofficial town spokesperson. From [[Makha]], [[Wellby]] learns that the two kenku wanderers and explorers who could tell him where to find someone who knows about the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]] have recently been kidnapped, by raiders from the sea who have been causing trouble in the last month. 

### Session 1

We begin our adventure in the [[Vermillion Isles]], in the port town of [[Wahacha]], in the [[Dolphin’s Rest Inn]], an establishment popular with sailors and other ‘grounders’  who visit [[Wahacha]], as it sits at the bottom of the steep red sea cliffs that define the islands, instead of nestled among the sides and tops of the cliffs like many of the kenku buildings. [[Wellby]] is introduced to [[Rufus]], [[Artem Novolozek]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]], all come together here to discuss the problem of the recent raids. After introductions, the group sets out quickly to the spot, about 40 miles to the east on the edge of the Endless Ocean, where the raiders are believed to come from.

After an uneventful day of sailing, the party comes to the likely location they are seeking, seeing both a wrecked ship and several small longboats at anchor above what looks like a large underwater island, a sea mount that nearly reaches the surface. From maybe 200 feet below the water, a faint green glow can be seen. After help from [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] to allow everyone who cannot already breath water to do so, the party dives down. 

They enter an underwater cave, and proceed along to a boulder blocking the entrance to a larger complex, from which the greenish light is leaking. The boulder is easy enough to move, although [[Alimash]] is nearly blinded by the fungal rot growing on it while shoving it aside. 

As the party descends into the cave, the first thing they see are three humans riding giant sharks, seemingly jousting with each other; meanwhile, a giant fan slowly spins in the middle of the floor, pulling fresh water from the sea into the cave itself. The sailors seem dazed, or enchanted, and immediately attack, after first turning the fan speed up so it begins to create a swirling current pulling any who get too close into the blades. 

The party engages in combat, and manages to defeat all the sharks and sailors, although realizes as the sailors die they are unable to breath, and suffocate. The party manages to save one of them via keeping them unconscious until [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] can cast Water Breathing. Speaking to this sailor, he can’t seem to remember much of the past few weeks, but warns them what is waiting below. [[Wellby]] lures a fish into range, bribes it with food, and beast senses in its mind to scout below, seeing first a chamber with the kenku prisoners, a massive shark, and a few more sailors, and then below a  giant tentacles aboleth lurking around a massive crystal prison holding an enormous creature, only one eye of which can occasionally be seen. But then the fish is eaten by the aboleth. 

Proceeding down, after turning off the spinning blades, the party attacks the shark. The battle turns, however, when they realize that there is a mage hiding in the mouth of the shark, who gets off a few deadly spells before [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] polymorphs the shark into a turtle, taking it out of the combat. Eventually, though, the mage is subdued and the prisoners temporarily rescued. But the tentacled aboleth continues to attack through the floor below.

![[aboleth-cave-wahacha.png|500]]
The party descends to its lair, and combat begins, as the aboleth attempts to lure its attackers via images of their greatest desires. Magic and weapons fly as the party works to bring this creature down, along with three enslaved sea elf knights. [[Shoal]] and [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] resist attempts to be lured into visions, and the party manages to largely shrug off attempts to charm them. Until near the end of the battle, [[Rufus]] succumbs to the psychic coral, falling unconscious as a vision of a world without crabs appears before him and then is cruelly taken away. And as the aboleth is nearing death, it manages to charm [[Alimash]] to fight on its side, although this does not last long, as with a blast of lightning [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] kills the beast before it can get full control of [[Alimash]]’s mind. 

We end as the aboleth falls to the floor of the cave, [[Rufus]] unconscious but stabilized by [[Wellby]], and the prisoners dazed as they come out of their enslavement.

#### Session 2

We begin in the aboleth’s cave as [[Rufus]], [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]], [[Shoal]], [[Alimash]], and [[Wellby]] deal with the aftermath of that creature’s death, and the dazed confusion of the prisoners and slaves of the aboleth coming out of their charmed state. As others tend to the prisoners, [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] immediately moves to recover the remorhaz heart, explaining that this rare treasure is his price for freedom. [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] is fleeing from Ursk, a magocracy run by eight families of wizards, known as the rodnye; the exact reasons for his flight are unclear, but the party gathers he was unwilling to pay a price asked of him. The remorhaz heart is to be traded with a partron in [[Medju]] who has the means to ensure his safe escape from the scrying eyes of the rodnye of Ursk. As [[Artem Novolozek|Artem]] gathers his treasure, he also examines the massive amber prison for some creature that none wish to see freed, and suggests that perhaps this is best left alone and undisturbed.

Meanwhile, the discussion turns to the prisoners. The two kenku – [[Nahto]] and [[Skoda]] – tell [[Wellby]] that the person he seeks is a wizard known as [[Arryn]] the Wanderer, originally from the western edge of [[The Green Sea]], and quite interested in the nature of the multiverse. He would surely know how to send [[Wellby]] to the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]]. Unfortunately, his apprentice, Ressena, the formerly enslaved mage, tells the party that [[Arryn]] is missing. He was experimenting with trying to reach the hypothesized [[Mirror Realm]], when [[Resenna]] heard a crash and a hand reached out of the reflective side of a silver water pitcher to try to grab her. She dodged and ran to investigate, but her master was nowhere to be seen, until she saw his reflection darting from shard to shard in the reflections of broken glass. When her reflection appeared and tried to grab her again, she fled, but was caught by the aboleth’s raiders on her way south to [[Medju]]. 

As the party heads above water to return to [[Wahacha]] and prepare for the journey north to [[Arryn’s Tower]], they are confronted with the realization that the prisoners of the aboleth have been sickened with some disease that causes their skin to burn when exposed to air for more than a handful of minutes. The sea elves volunteer to shelter the freed captives (who retain the ability to breath underwater while the disease infects them) until a cure can be found, while the party gathers supplies for the journey north, and [[Nahto]] repairs [[Wellby]]’s kenku armor to allow him to activate the wings that were previously broken. 

Finally, [[Alimash]], [[Wellby]], and [[Shoal]] head north in a small sailing boat, navigating their way north towards [[Arryn’s Tower]]. past the oddities and sights of the Eastern Isles: a small island with an incredibly dense pine forest, no signs of cities or towns, but small lights moving in the darkness through the trees as the adventurers ride at anchor for the night off the coast; a sheltered harbor in what appears to be a coral atoll, except all the coral has turned to solid stone; a flat island, covered in a vast expanse of salt marsh and shallow dunes just barely above the ocean, moving fast in the current seemingly unmoored from whatever keeps these islands roughly in place, with lizardfolk on the shore swimming and playing in the water. 

The party arrives at the small island on which [[Arryn’s Tower]] stands, mooring on the long dock that, while obviously in use recently, is currently deserted. Following the path, the party approaches the tower. While [[Wellby]] begins to inspect the door, shards of glass spread around the outside entrance – seemingly from several broken mirrors – begin to swirl into swarms and animate, attacking the party. [[Wellby]] makes a few attempts at unlocking the door, but in the chaos of battle finds it difficult, and instead turns to fight. The party manages to reduce the glass swarms to dust in short order, and with time to study the door quickly yields to [[Wellby]]’s lockpicking skill. 

The first floor of the tower is a entryway and an elaborate audience chamber, where all reflective surfaces seem to have been removed or dirtied with soot and lard to prevent reflections. Some experimentation with pools of water reveals that reflections animate, and move separately from the person they are reflecting, to the point that [[Wellby]]’s mirror hand begins to reach out of a puddle of water and try to grab [[Wellby]]. After some further experimenting with reflections, the party heads up the stairs to continue exploring. 

The second floor – kitchens and servant’s quarters – is not deserted. The party finds [[Gyles]], [[Arryn]]’s steward, here. He is not doing well, struggling to deal with the chaos of what is happening in the tower. It takes some convincing, but the party eventually gets him to believe they are real. He tells them that after [[Arryn]] vanished, [[Resenna]] told him to run, but he refused to abandon [[Arryn]] or the place he had called home for more than 15 years. But then a mirror reflection of himself tried to emerge from a mirror and take him over. He smashed the mirrors, but was too scared to leave the tower, afraid of the reflections in the ocean. He suspects [[Arryn]] has been taken into the [[Mirror Realm]]. 

As the conversation progresses and it becomes clear the party may need to distinguish between the mirror [[Arryn]] and the real [[Arryn]], [[Shoal]] asks [[Gyles]] for something about [[Arryn]] that only [[Arryn]] would know, and is told about when they were coming east, on a halfling ship, [[Arryn]] sang the Lost Lads of [[Tollen]], the only time he’d ever heard him sing. 

The party flies to the top of the tower, avoiding whatever dangers lie on the 3rd floor. It takes some time and convincing a raccoon to investigate, but they find the location of [[Arryn]]’s notes with clues to the [[Mirror Realm]]. The raccoon also ends up in the [[Mirror Realm]] itself, and sees two wizards wandering around, confirming that both the (presumably) real [[Arryn]] and the duplicate [[Arryn]] are still alive. From [[Arryn]]’s notes and observation of the raccoon, the party learns that in order for the real [[Arryn]] to be returned to this world, the duplicate [[Arryn]] must be destroyed. 

After some discussion of how to proceed, the party decides that [[Wellby]] will use his smoke arrow to obscure the room with the mirrors at the top of the tower, and everyone will rush around covering the mirrors with drapes and sheets so that they can control the creation of duplicates. Then [[Alimash]] will enter the [[Mirror Realm]] to try to figure out which is the real [[Arryn]] and kill the duplicate, while [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] (presumably) deal with the [[Alimash]] duplicate that appears on this end. 

The plan immediately faces complications, however, when [[Alimash]] speaks to an [[Arryn]] and realizes the wizard does not remember the real world and that magic does not work in the [[Mirror Realm]], while at the same time mirror-[[Alimash]] charges [[Wellby]] in a rage. As [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] battle mirror-[[Alimash]], real [[Alimash]] pushes the [[Arryn]] version away, after humming the Lost Lads of [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Tollen/Tollen|Tollen]] to him with no effect, and runs down two flights of stairs to talk to the other [[Arryn]], where the conversation repeats. [[Wellby]] and [[Shoal]] attempt to restrain mirror-[[Alimash]] to give real-[[Alimash]] time, while real-[[Alimash]] hums again to the other [[Arryn]], who recognizes the tune. [[Alimash]] immediately stabs the first [[Arryn]], who shatters into thousands of tiny silver shards as the real [[Arryn]] fades and begins to reappear in the real world. At that moment, [[Shoal]] strikes with all his power at the now-restrained mirror-[[Alimash]], who likewise shatters into thousands of pieces as the real [[Alimash]] emerges. 

Quickly, restored to his memories and powers, [[Arryn]] closes the portal to the [[Mirror Realm]], severing the connection, and turns to thank [[Wellby]], [[Alimash]], and [[Shoal]] profusely. After giving gifts to [[Alimash]] (a ring of mind shielding) and [[Shoal]] (a deck of beautiful illusions), [[Wellby]] asks about the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild|Feywild]]. [[Arryn]] gifts him a necklace enchanted with moonlight as a gift to secure an honorable Fey guide, and the plane-shifts him to Lastlight Falls, the portal in northern [[Dunmar]] where [[Wellby]] will meet his friends.
