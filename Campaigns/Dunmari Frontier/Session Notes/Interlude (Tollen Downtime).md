## Bastion Information

The map room and the hall of stories can each give you three true facts about something. This can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object for the Hall of Stories; or a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object for the Map Room. You have time to use each room 2-3 times during the journey and Tollen downtime. 
### Map Room (Ursk)

- [[Ursk]] is ruled by a council of powerful wizards, the heads of the eight rodnye
- The rodnye (singular: rodnya) are loose confederations of people, mostly magic-users but not exclusively, bound together by some kind of mysterious ritual
- Emigration is tightly controlled in Ursk, and the few people who do leave tend to be sickly and weak
### Map Room (Land between Ursk and Vostok)

- This is a land of boreal forests, swift rivers, and rocky coasts, with few people, a dangerous place, where dragon attacks are common
- Halfling memories do speak of a people who live in the forests, scattered groups related to the people of Vostok and the Sembaran Highlands, who worship animal spirits
- Rumors claim that once, before the [[Great War]], the giants of the [[Svinjo Mountains]] (SHEEF-nyo; meta: the mountains forming the eastern border of Vostok - name might change) provided sanctuary and protection to many people - human, stoneborn, dwarf, and others - against the dangers of the north, but recent tales do not tell what has become of this protection
### Hall of Stories (Rodnya Voknaz)

Few, vague, and cryptic are the tales of the Rodnya, but here is what you are able to gather

- Pragmatism, not dogmatism, is the way of the Voknaz
- The Rodnya Voknaz is among the weakest and least influential of the Rodnye
- This does not mean the Rodnya Voknaz are weak: it is said the head of Voknaz can permanently turn boulders into young dragons with magic.

## Scrying

## Philosopher's Guild Information

- Letter about the [[Rodnya Voknaz]], received in trade for the silver wand from the Elemental Forge: [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Rodnya Voknaz]]
- Letter about Ursk and its cities and ways to access them, received in trade for the gem of demon summoning taking from Kadmos: [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Ursk]]

## Mirror Visions
- [[Magical Pale Blue Dye Vision]]
- [[Cecilia's White Dragon Tooth Vision]]
## Other Information

- A message from [[Fausto]] to [[Delwath]], via the Sending spell, received on Feb 25th: “[[Apollyon]] sends his regards, and asks: what's the matter, Delwath, don't you want to see the rest of my little surprise? Scared to watch?”
- Information recovered from the [[Kharsan]] Archives, by the painstaking work of Nuzkar, cross-referenced to books available in Tollen and now acquired for the Vindristjarna Archives, provides a [[Dunmar#History|chronicle of Dunmari history]] in the days before the Great War, detailing the [[Aatmaji Dynasty|first dynasty of Dunmari Samraats]], which ended with a disastrous expedition to destroy the lingering evil in Drankor led by Samraat Aatmaji [[Dasa]], who died in the attempt. While most of this is fragmentary, [[Nuzkar]] is able to reconstruct two notes:
	- [[Report of the Aagiri to Samraat Dasa]]
	- [[An Annotated (Partial) Map of Drankor]]
