## Narrative

We begin as the party returns to the skyship [[Vindristjarna]], to discuss and plan while awaiting the arrival of Loremaster [[Azogar]] and General [[Murook]], who are expecting a tour of the ship. After some discussion of the events of earlier in the day, and the magic of the [[Mantle of Protection]], conversation stops as the orcish visitors arrive. 

Loremaster [[Azogar]] is very curious about the magic of the skyship, and quickly catches [[Seeker]]'s attention with his questioning. [[Seeker]] explains about the phasing stone, holding little back, as the conversation drifts among topics, touching on the origin of the phasing stone, the [[Feywild]] and its connection to cloak, and the idea of crystallized magic connecting to many different planes. [[Azogar]] speaks of the various rumors and tales he has collected, from the time before the founding of [[Xurkhaz]], when the [[Orcs]] wandered widely, hiding where they could from [[Thark]]'s raiders. In particular, a tale of a hero of his people, who used the crystalized magic of the [[elemental plane of water]] to create fog that hid his tribe for years. During the conversation, [[Murook]] asks about the tactical uses of the skyship, as well, and quizzes the party on exactly what happens to the dead, reanimated [[Orcs]]. 

[[Murook]] and [[Azogar]] depart, reminding the party they are due at the palace for dinner shortly, and leave the party to plan. During this time, the party discusses options, and [[Delwath]] scries on [[Hektor]], seeing [[Kadmos]] and his companions hunched over a map or piece of paper, discussing in low voices, seeming separated for the moment from the main army of [[Grash]]'s forces. 

At dinner, Chief [[Lubash]] seems more open, talking more freely. He explains the nature of the cloak's protection: within the borders of [[Xurkhaz]], [[Thark]]'s voice cannot be heard. [[Orcs]] bound to [[Thark]] will suddenly have that connection severed, and few will be able to fight effectively after that happens. But, he does not know if the undead [[Orcs]] raised by [[Grash]] remain connected to [[Thark]]: if they do, he does not fear them, but if they don't, then they would not be affected by the cloak's magic. This protection has taken years to create, and maintain, pacing the borders of the country, which is a large part of the [[Orcs|orc]]'s reluctance to abandon [[Xurkhaz]], even though they have refuges prepared in the broken hills to the east. 

The party also learns some more history of the cloak. It was created by the [[Cloudspinner]], the Lady of Sunsets, the archfey ruler of the fey domain of [[Amberglow]], now gone, her domain abandoned. With her missing, the cloak is irreplaceable. 

Finally, they learn something of the previous Chardonian party that came to [[Xurkhaz]]. There were four of them: two warriors, twin brothers, named [[Valius]] and [[Vargus]], a spellcaster named [[Evelina]], and a trickster rogue named Roman. They came in two groups: [[Valius]], [[Vargus]], and [[Evelina]] pretending to be scholars seeking to open trade ties and knowledge exchange between [[Chardon]] and [[Xurkhaz]], and Roman, disguised by illusion magic as an [[Orcs|orc]] wanderer. They lived in the palace for a month or more, learning about the cloak and the [[Orcs]], but were eventually found out when Roman slipped up and was seen talking to the Chardonians while not under his illusion spell. Roman was killed, and the others fled east, taking some time, more than a month, to reconnect with [[Kadmos]]. 

Conversation turns to planning and strategy for [[Kadmos]]' inevitable attack on the palace. After considering several plans, it is eventually agreed that the party will pretend to have a falling out with Chief [[Lubash]], who will pretend to expel them from his kingdom. In reality, they will hide, hoping to set a trap for [[Kadmos]] and company. 

During this time, [[Delwath]]'s messenger lynx returns, bearing a letter for [[Kenzo]] from the Lakan Monks: [[Lakan Monk Letter]].

Finally, after exploring the palace and beginning to make some plans, the party returns to [[Lubash]]'s throne room, and summons the [[Orcs|orc]] trapped in the mirror to speak. She is confused, but is apparently an [[Orcs|orc]] of [[Xurkhaz]], from 60 years ago, who was caught by [[Agata]] and interrogated, with the hope that she would reveal some of the secrets of the cloak to [[Agata]]. She is freed, released from the mirror into [[Lubash]]'s care, as the session ends.
