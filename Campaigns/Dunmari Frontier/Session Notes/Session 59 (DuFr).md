## Narrative
We begin in the lizardfolk village of [[Bedez]], where, finally, a group of lizardfolk heroes have gathered before a council of elders. From these, based on the blessings of the ancestors, a few will be chosen to travel with [[Kenzo]] to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] and confront whatever is throwing the jungle out of balance. As the council ends, [[Kenzo]] meets [[Izzarak]], the first chosen, who introduces himself as well as the two baby lizardfolk he cares for, who were brought to him by a jaguar who said they must be taken to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]. The next morning, as [[Kenzo]] and [[Izzarak]] prepare to set out for the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], they are joined by [[Enari]], another lizardfolk, a skilled warrior, tracker, and guide.

The next morning, after some conversation, the party sets off for the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], led by [[Enari]], who has traveled widely and knows the way. The first day’s travel through the jungle is uneventful, marked by [[Izzarak]] communing with the gods to try to understand the dangers they will face, learning that it is the elements – earth, air, fire, water – that will be the dangers in the jungle, and that the forest bleeds. [[Kenzo]] speaks of his vision, of the wounded creature draining the jungle, upsetting the balance of the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]. 

The next day, the party approaches the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], and the volcano that dominates the horizon, a faint red glow of lava visible on its summit, the crackling sound of something in the jungle ahead. The party stops to investigate, and sees a running river of lava cutting through the jungle, sizzling but not burning the trees it passes near. [[Kenzo]] stops to reach out and commune with the forest, senses not only that the elemental [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] is intruding in the world of Taelgar here, but there is a whirlwind, a tornado pulling the energy of the spiritual realms into the center of the Footprint.

Meanwhile, [[Enari]] and [[Izzarak]], watching the river of laval, see racing along the surface, a spirit of fire, dancing in the lava, being chased and attacked by a flaming ankylosaurs and two giant wasps of fire. After debate as to whether and how to intervene in this fight, the party attacks the dinosaur and the wasps. [[Izzarak]] calls upon the power of the stars and takes on the form of a starry dragon constellation, shooting magic bolts of energy, while [[Enari]] stabs with his pike and [[Kenzo]] with his staff, disrupting the ki of these creatures.  

As the battle ends, the magma dancer turns to speak with his apparent saviors. The party learns this creature is called [[Somi-nai]], also known as Sugarra, and he is the volcano, the spirit of the volcano. He tells the party how his home has been overrun with fire, with pure destruction, with none of the rejuvenation that should accompany fire. Although skeptical and even contemptuous of their likelihood of success, [[Somi-nai]] speaks of [[Motua]], the creature at the center of the great whirlwind in the heart of the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], the force that is draining [[Somi-nai]]’s power. He talks of [[Motua]], one of the Gidari (guardians), coming from the veil, the [[Land of the Dead]], for reasons unknown to him, and the destruction that [[Motua]] has wrought. While he has little advice for how to kill the creature, [[Somi-nai]] believes that [[Motua]] must die to restore order and harmony to the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]].  

We end as [[Somi-nai]] returns to his domain, the volcano, and the party contemplates how to cross the running lava river.
