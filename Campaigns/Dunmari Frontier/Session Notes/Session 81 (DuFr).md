# Session 81
*in which the party visits [[Orenlas]]*

**In the real world:** Nov 8, 2023
**In Taelgar:**  Jan 8, 1749 - Jan 16, 1749

## Summary

- The party visited the forest of [[Orenlas]], where they explored the living city of [[Erelion]], visiting the sacred elder tree and meeting Caretaker [[Erdhin]], the gardener [[Ealwen]], the retired solider [[Vahaiya]], and the poet [[Cirdore]]
- The party spoke with the ancient [[Elves|elf]] [[Arheste]], who told them about the days of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]: the [[Drankorian Civil War|civil war]] that ended centuries of peace; the rise of [[Omnis Pura]]; [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s reign; and his attempted ascension to godhood and ultimate downfall. 
- After spending a day speaking with an learning from [[Arheste]], the party got a desperate message from [[Riswynn]], informing them that [[Grash]] was nearly finished constructing a massive trebuchet, 400 feet tall at least, and if they did not arrive soon, [[Uzgukhar]] would be destroyed. 

#### The Story of Apollyon and Cha'mutte

Piecing together what [[Arheste]] told you, you reconstruct the following timeline of [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] and [[Cha'mutte]]. 

This story is told from [[Arheste]]'s point of view [[Arheste#Arheste's Story|here]].

- After the Drankorian civil war, [[Omnis Pura]] and [[Cha'mutte]] became allies, and when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] came to power, he continued to ally with [[Cha'mutte]]. 
- However, [[Cha'mutte]] became angry when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] stole the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] from the free [[orcs]], as [[Cha'mutte]]'s goal was to free all species from the "shackles" of their divine creators, whether they wished it or not. The cloak was a step in that direction. You saw part of this in the [[Mantle of Protection Vision]]. 
- As [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] grew in power, he began systematically slaughtering the peronar, the [[elves]] who had allied with [[humans]] long ago on [[Hkar]]. He used powerful magic to turn the people of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] into slavishly devoted subjects, hoping to further his dream of an empire of only the "purest" of humanity. 
- Using the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]], [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] was able to defeat the [[elves]] of Rostaurë ([[Arheste]]'s home), as the cloak prevented the divine power of [[Aldanor]] and[[Elmerca]] from protecting the land. He brought [[Arheste]], captured back to [[Drankor]], where she saw his rise to power firsthand. You saw some of this in the [[Scepter of Command Vision]]. 
- [[Cha'mutte]] fully turned on [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to ascend to godhood, in defiance of [[Cha'mutte]]'s plans and hopes for the world. At the moment [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to claim divine power, he was struck down by the [[First Plague]], a devastating magical force of [[Cha'mutte]]'s creation. 
- [[Arheste]] survived the plague, but at great cost. It left her sick and weakened, and stripped her of her formidable magic.
- [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] also survived the plague, by drinking of vial of a pure black substance. [[Arheste]] later learned that this was the key ingredient in a ritual of undeath, and had turned [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] into a lich.
- However, [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] was trapped by [[Cha'mutte]], who for unexplained reasons did not seek to destroy [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] utterly. Whether it was because he couldn't, or because he didn't want to, [[Arheste]] never learned. 
- When [[Cha'mutte]] was killed, [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] began to break free, until [[Rai]] teleported to [[Drankor]], warned by [[Arheste]], and sought to maintain the bonds. [[Arheste]] never learned how [[Rai]] did this, but speculated it was as simple as grasping [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s phylactery in his magical [[jade]] hand. 
- At the beginning of this leya, around 1720 as [[humans]] reckon time, [[Arheste]] felt something change. A break, a shift, in [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s bonds, letting him break free and slowly gain power, recovering from the weakness of his long imprisonment. 
- [[Arheste]], though too weak from the ongoing effects of plague exposure to seek [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] herself, will do anything in her power to ensure that he is defeated, once and for all, his phylactery destroyed utterly, and any hope of his resurrection crushed. 

The story of the scepter of command, as told in later days by the halflings, is [[Story of the Scepter of Command|here]].

Perhaps, if you defeat Grash and save [[Xurkhaz]], [[Azogar]] will tell you the full story of the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]], as the [[People of the Rainbow]] understand it.

## Narrative

We begin on [[Vindristjarna]], as the party has returned to the skyship after several days at the Elemental Forge while [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] constructed a number of magic items from the residual energy of the forge left behind by [[Sh’shethis]]'s departure. The day before, as [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] finished his work, the party had viewed the [[Elemental Forge Vision|forge itself in Eudomes' mirror]]. Now, we pick up as the party heads south for Orenlas, and [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] writes in his journal:

*4 Barukhelm 5881, he writes*

*My first adventure in more than a decade succeeded beyond my wildest imagination. That Seeker fellow sure knows how to pick his friends. I was not sure what to think when I first met them: they seemed rather prone to excessive chatter, and terminal indecision. I was afraid it would be like being back on my travels with Lyrial and her friends. So much time sitting around debating, so little time doing! Although I guess it was in one of those rambling discursions that she told me about the Edge of Echoes in the first place.*

*But once we got moving, I couldn't help but wonder at the powerful oddities they carried and their skill at using them. A folding boat I've seen, sure; but a mirror that reveals the history of things? That was a sight. And all Seeker's friends proved quite adept in battle: I think I would have been drowned by water elementals if they had not leapt to my defense.*

*And flight! Ah, to fly again! It was nothing like the flying carpet we borrowed back in the day. To be able to think and just go where you wished it - truly something else. Somehow the fey step trick I learned from Lyrial feels cheap in comparison now.*

*Of course, my goal was to make my dear Pebblepeep fly, and I can't believe how successful I was! I surprise even myself sometimes, ha ha. All the hard work outfitting this ship (oh, this ship! I wonder if they'll let me stay, or maybe even fly it some day?) was well worth it.*

*It will be hard going back to life in Tollen after this.*

The next day, the ship arrives at the edge of [[Orenlas]]. The forest is shrouded in mists, and the party is forced to land outside, on the shores of the large lake, using the [[Vindristjarna#Planar Prism|planar prism]] for the first time to construct a rainbow bridge from the ship to the ground. While Faldrak stays behind, the party ventures into the forest.

The paths open up as they walk, revealing visions and fragments of images of possible futures: Kenzo, mediating in a world of imp
