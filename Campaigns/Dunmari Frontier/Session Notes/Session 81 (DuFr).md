# Session 81
*in which the party visits [[Orenlas]]*

**In the real world:** Nov 8, 2023
**In Taelgar:**  Jan 8, 1749 - Jan 16, 1749

## Summary

- The party visited the forest of [[Orenlas]], where they explored the living city of [[Erelion]], visiting the sacred elder tree and meeting Caretaker [[Erdhin]], the gardener [[Ealwen]], the retired solider [[Vahaiya]], and the poet [[Cirdore]]
- The party spoke with the ancient [[Elves|elf]] [[Arheste]], who told them about the days of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]: the [[Drankorian Civil War|civil war]] that ended centuries of peace; the rise of [[Omnis Pura]]; [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s reign; and his attempted ascension to godhood and ultimate downfall. 
- After spending a day speaking with an learning from [[Arheste]], the party got a desperate message from [[Riswynn]], informing them that [[Grash]] was nearly finished constructing a massive trebuchet, 400 feet tall at least, and if they did not arrive soon, [[Uzgukhar]] would be destroyed. 

#### The Story of Apollyon and Cha'mutte

Piecing together what [[Arheste]] told you, you reconstruct the following timeline of [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] and [[Cha'mutte]]. 

- After the Drankorian civil war, [[Omnis Pura]] and [[Cha'mutte]] became allies, and when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] came to power, he continued to ally with [[Cha'mutte]]. 
- However, [[Cha'mutte]] became angry when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] stole the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] from the free [[orcs]], as [[Cha'mutte]]'s goal was to free all species from the "shackles" of their divine creators, whether they wished it or not. The cloak was a step in that direction. You saw part of this in the [[Mantle of Protection Vision]]. 
- As [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] grew in power, he began systematically slaughtering the peronar, the [[elves]] who had allied with [[humans]] long ago on [[Hkar]]. He used powerful magic to turn the people of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] into slavishly devoted subjects, hoping to further his dream of an empire of only the "purest" of humanity. 
- Using the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]], [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] was able to defeat the [[elves]] of RostaurÃ« ([[Arheste]]'s home), as the cloak prevented the divine power of [[Aldanor]] and[[Elmerca]] from protecting the land. He brought [[Arheste]], captured back to [[Drankor]], where she saw his rise to power firsthand. You saw some of this in the [[Scepter of Command Vision]]. 
- [[Cha'mutte]] fully turned on [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] when [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to ascend to godhood, in defiance of [[Cha'mutte]]'s plans and hopes for the world. At the moment [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] attempted to claim divine power, he was struck down by the [[First Plague]], a devastating magical force of [[Cha'mutte]]'s creation. 
- [[Arheste]] survived the plague, but at great cost. It left her sick and weakened, and stripped her of her formidable magic.
- [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] also survived the plague, by drinking of vial of a pure black substance. [[Arheste]] later learned that this was the key ingredient in a ritual of undeath, and had turned [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] into a lich.
- However, [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] was trapped by [[Cha'mutte]], who for unexplained reasons did not seek to destroy [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] utterly. Whether it was because he couldn't, or because he didn't want to, [[Arheste]] never learned. 
- When [[Cha'mutte]] was killed, [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] began to break free, until [[Rai]] teleported to [[Drankor]], warned by [[Arheste]], and sought to maintain the bonds. [[Arheste]] never learned how [[Rai]] did this, but speculated it was as simple as grasping [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s phylactery in his magical [[jade]] hand. 
- At the beginning of this leya, around 1720 as [[humans]] reckon time, [[Arheste]] felt something change. A break, a shift, in [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s bonds, letting him break free and slowly gain power, recovering from the weakness of his long imprisonment. 
- [[Arheste]], though too weak from the ongoing effects of plague exposure to seek [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] herself, will do anything in her power to ensure that he is defeated, once and for all, his phylactery destroyed utterly, and any hope of his resurrection crushed. 

This story is told from [[Arheste]]'s point of view [[Arheste#Arheste's Story|here]].
