## Narrative
Our session begins in the evening, as the party discusses the fate of the [[Crown of Purity]] on [[Vindristjarna]]. They are interrupted by two events in quick succession. [[Seeker]]’s hair begins to desaturate, the white streak spreading unnaturally. At the same time, [[Egnir]]’s voice rings out in alarm. The party rushes onto the deck to witness a glowing amber stag galloping through the sky, a woman with flame-colored hair and molten amber eyes riding upon it, carrying a pulsating crystalline object that radiating with a warm reddish light. 

The woman, clearly fey, demands, in a shaking voice, "*Where is she? Release her if you have her. I serve the [[Cloudspinner]], and I will have her returned."* Between Kenzo's soul sight and [[Delwath]]'s detect thoughts spell, the party quickly realizes she is scared and nervous, but not a threat or an enemy. She introduces herself as [[Lirien]], Lanternkeeper of the [[Redsun Watch]], bearer of the last [[Amberlight]]. The party agrees to take her to see [[Cloudspinner]], currently imprisoned in a translucent crystal block in [[Vindristjarna]]'s hold. But, at the same time, it is apparent that Seeker's transformation is progressing rapidly. Kenzo pulls Seeker aside for a closer discussion, while the rest of the party walks with [[Lirien]] and hears her story. 

[[Lirien]] says she came to be after the [[Cloudspinner]] had left, and [[Amberglow]] was already a place in decay. She lived at [[Redsun Watch]], a fortress and refuge along the [[Sunset Gate]], charged by the [[Cloudspinner]] to protect the wall of sunset from the enroaching dark. Which they did, for a long time. Until, one day, the [[Sunset Gate]] cracked, and darkness flowed like a river from the realms beyond, [[Darkfall]] and [[Hollowdark]]. [[Redsun Watch]] fell, and [[Lirien]] fled with one of the Amberlights; as far as she knows, she is the only one who survived. She wandered for a long time; soon, the light of the [[Amberlight]] faded, and she eventually settled in [[Everlight's Bloom]], hopeless about the future of [[Amberglow]]. Until ten days ago, when the [[Amberlight]] suddenly blazed awake. She followed its pulsing through the portal at the [[Bitterwine Oak]], to [[Vindristjarna]]. Reaching the entrapped body of the [[Cloudspinner]], [[Lirien]] collapsed in awe as her [[Amberlight]] flared. 

Meanwhile, [[Kenzo]], studying [[Seeker]], sees two overlapping auras—[[Seeker]]’s own and an unfamiliar, panicked presence. Attempting *Cleansing Touch*, [[Kenzo]] finds nothing to dispel; [[Seeker]] is not cursed, but seems to be carrying another presence with him. Soon, [[Seeker]]’s entire body desaturated, save for the once-white streak in his hair, which now burns a sunset red. At this point, he seemed fully possessed, speaking in an unfamiliar, high-pitched voice: *"Such color... it has been so long!"* Identifying herself as [[Lady Eventide]], the entity demands to see the [[Cloudspinner]]. [[Kenzo]] telepathically alerted the party, prompting them to bring [[Lirien]] to speak with this new presence. When [[Lirien]] shone her lantern’s light upon [[Seeker]], a ghostly image of a tall, courtly woman appeared—grayscale, save for a single strand of sunset-colored hair.

[[Lady Eventide]] seemed to recognize [[Lirien]], or at least understand the places she referenced, and inquired about the fate of the other lantern keepers. [[Lirien]] tearfully admitted she believed them all lost to the dangers on the borders: the [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]], [[Harrow]], and [[Wend]]. At this point, the party agreed to bring [[Seeker]]/[[Lady Eventide]] to see the [[Cloudspinner]]. As she arrived, she stumbled in awe and fear, uncertain but declaring that to free her, they must find the [[Prismwell]]. Before further discussion could occur, though, [[Lirien]] suddenly shouted that her steed was in danger and rushed upstairs. 

In the face of an attack, the party sounds the alarm, waking [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]], who rushes to arm the ice cannon. Meanwhile, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] -- and [[Seeker]]/[[Lady Eventide]] -- turn to confront a massive void of darkness that seems to be racing towards [[Vindristjarna]]. [[Wellby]] strikes first with an arrow of seeking, forcing the shadowy entity to recoil, but it retalitation, it unleashed a wave of blackness across the deck of [[Vindristjarna]]. While [[Kenzo]] avoided harm entirely, and [[Delwath]] managed to somewhat resist the effects, [[Riswynn]] and [[Seeker]] suffered greviously, and [[Lirien]] and her steed were completely destroyed, swept away by the darkness, their bodies disintegrated, replaced by shadowy shades. The battle raged as the shades attacked [[Riswynn]] and [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]]. [[Kenzo]] fought with precision, his strikes frightening the enemy. However, more shadows emerged, seven foot tall human-like creatures of darkness, carrying swords of night and emitting an aura of silence, preventing spellcasting and communication, speaking harshly:*"The [[Cloudspinner]] will not return. Silence will fall."*

With the battlefield looking grim, and [[Wellby]] falling unconscious from several attacks by more large flying shades, [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] finally reached the control room to activate the ice cannon, and [[Riswynn]] launched a massive _Sunburst_. [[Wellby]] -- teleported to safety by [[Delwath]]'s _Scatter_ spell -- revives himself in a stroke of luck, and [[Delwath]]'s _Synaptic Static_ shattered the focus of several enemies. Still, the enemy pressed on, holding on against an ice barrage from [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]], a lightning arrow from [[Wellby]], and a summoned construct from [[Seeker]]/[[Lady Eventide]]. Finally, with the shadows weakening, [[Delwath]]'s Eldritch Blast, [[Wellby]]'s arrows, and [[Seeker]]/[[Lady Eventide]], polymorphed into a giant ape, ended the battle. 

The session ends as [[Seeker]]/[[Lady Eventide]] warns that others will be coming, and immediate departure is of the essence, as [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] set course for the [[Bitterwine Oak]] fey portal and the party turned to rest.
