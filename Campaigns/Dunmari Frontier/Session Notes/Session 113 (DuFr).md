### Detailed Summary

#### The Approach to the Temple of the Eight Divines
- The session begins aboard [[Vindristjarna]], hovering above the ruins of the massive Temple of the Eight Divines in [[Drankor]], which is the last known location of [[Apollyon]]’s phylactery.
- Using his rune, [[Seeker]] determines that there is no adamantine immediately below but detects a significant underground excavation beneath the temple.
- The party debates why [[Rai]] didn’t destroy the phylactery and considers its potential hidden location:
	- Destroying a phylactery may require knowledge of its creation, which Rai possibly lacked.
	- The phylactery’s destruction might have unintended consequences, such as weakening Apollyon’s prison.
	- [[Arheste]] spoke of destroying phylacteries, which is often is made easier by, and may even require, precise knowledge of their creation.
- The party theorizes [[Rai]] might have hidden the phylactery in the temple, possibly with divine protection, to prevent [[Apollyon]] or his minions from reclaiming it.
- [[Kenzo]] tries to detect Apollyon’s soul or presence, but senses a complete absence of Apollyon’s essence, possibly due to magical concealment or interdimensional displacement.
- The group resolves to begin their exploration of the temple’s exterior and underground areas, noting their limited time before magical protections and resources diminish. They instruct [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] to remain vigilant and send a search party if the group does not return by evening.
#### Inside the Temple of the Eight Divines
- The party enters the Temple, marveling at its pristine condition. Despite the oppressive atmosphere outside, the interior feels warm and peaceful, with sunlight illuminating the marble floor through a magical or mirrored dome.
- The temple’s central chamber is vast, with a massive altar made of intricately inlaid marble and gold and decorated with gem-encrusted candelabras and chalices. Eight large chapels, each dedicated to one of the Eight Divines, radiate from the central dome.
- [[Seeker]] investigates the altar, noting a powerful aura of divine magic emanating from it. The glow and warmth seem strongest here.
- [[Wellby]] and [[Kenzo]] scout the main chamber and side chapels, finding no signs of recent occupation. The magic of the altar appears to maintain the temple’s immaculate state.
- [[Delwath]] uses ghostly gaze to survey the crypt below. He identifies a large underground vault directly beneath the altar, with eight smaller crypts leading outward beneath each chapel.
- While searching, [[Kenzo]]’s staff and the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] triggers a vision of Rai as a jade statue speaking to [[Dimitaur]] in the temple. [[Rai]] mentions hiding the phylactery in a lead-lined chest beneath the temple to shield it from Apollyon’s minions. However, the chest appears to be missing.
- [[Riswynn]] casts *Divination*, asking whether the phylactery remains in the crypt. The response confirms the object was placed below, though powerful arcane magic obscures its current location.

#### Discovering the Crypt and Exploring the Underchapels
- [[Wellby]] uncovers an illusion concealing steps leading down to the crypt. Despite auras of disinterest affecting [[Seeker]] and [[Delwath]], the party follows [[Wellby]].
- Another vision from [[Kenzo]]’s staff shows [[Rai]] weaving protective magic into the floor, creating magic to discourage exploration. 
- The stairs lead to a grand crypt chamber, adorned with statues, niches, and elaborate memorials for the dead of [[Drankor]]. Many statues feature metal death masks, a Drankorian funerary tradition.
- The crypt includes a central chamber and nine passageways leading to additional areas: eight underchapels for each of the Eight Divines and one grand vault.
- Kenzo’s staff triggers another vision in the passage to the grand vault, showing Rai hiding the chest and invoking powerful concealment magic. The vision also depicts a celestial elven warrior seemingly tied to the crypt’s defense, defending the passageway against intruders.
- The party begins exploring the underchapels, starting with the Sibyl’s. Each chapel contains similar layouts with niches, memorials, and magical altars that maintain the temple’s protective wards.
- The group concludes their initial investigation of the underchapels and prepares to delve deeper into the grand vault.
#### The Grand Vault and the Hidden Chest
- The party enters the grand vault, observing a large, domed crypt lined with niches and faint remnants of memorials. Unlike other areas, the vault is stark and free of magic, giving it an eerie emptiness.
- Kenzo’s staff shows another vision of Rai casting spells and uttering "Naun Tarvanos," an Elvish phrase meaning [[Valley of the Hidden Forest]]. The chest disappears, but its location remains unclear.
- The party contacts [[Dimitaur]], Rai’s former familiar. He recounts how Rai repeatedly insisted the phylactery remain in the temple for safety. He associates "Naun Tarvanos" with a place Rai once visited, but insists the chest is likely still within the temple.
- Searching the room again, Delwath stumbles upon an invisible chest in the center of the vault, concealed by powerful magic. Using flour and careful exploration, the party confirms its outline.
- Riswynn manages to dispels multiple layers of protective spells on the chest, including *Glyph of Warding*, *Symbol*, *Arcane Lock*, and *Sequester*. The final ward was designed to teleport intruders to an Elven divine realm, but Riswynn dispelled it successfully. 

#### The Phylactery Revealed

- After confirming no additional traps, and figuring out how to unlcok the chest, Delwath opens the chest using *Mage Hand* to avoid any lingering dangers.
- Inside the chest lies a plain dagger made of adamantium, confirmed to be Apollyon’s phylactery.
- Kenzo’s soul sight reveals the phylactery contains seven souls, each sacrificed to create the vessel for Apollyon’s essence.
- Seeker studies the dagger with the aid of Kenzo and other party members, and with careful attention arcane notes from Apollyon's tower on the Circular Island. The group learns the following:
	- The seven souls were Drankorians, mostly humans with a few mixed species, who lived in the city during Apollyon’s reign.
	- These individuals were falsely accused of crimes, taken to the island, and sacrificed by Apollyon to bind their essences into the phylactery.
	- The souls form a protective cocoon around Apollyon’s essence within the dagger.
	- Their names are listed in Apollyon's notes: [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], [[Marius of Drankor]], [[Valanthe]], [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], [[Khemut of Targu]], and [[Minarith]]
- Hidden in Apollyon's notes, Seeker discovers a potential method to destroy the phylactery:
	- If a portal to the Land of the Dead can be opened, the dagger must be taken there.
	- Once in the Land of the Dead, the souls must be guided to remember their identities and pass into their divine realms. This process will unravel the phylactery.
	- Apollyon believed this method was impossible, as only one who possessed both the phylactery itself and the notes on its construction could even attempt this challenge.
- The party identifies the administrative complex behind the temple as a potential source of detailed records on the victims. They decide to search it for artifacts or clues.
- After a thorough search of the administrative complex, the group finds a [[Book of Martyrs of the Radiant Path]], containing information on four of the seven victims. Key discoveries include:
	- Three victims are listed as martyrs memorialized in the temple, their bodies never recovered: [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], and [[Marius of Drankor]]
	- [[Valanthe]], an elf, lived in the Elven neighborhood north of the temple and is also listed as a martyr.  
- While [[Seeker]] is researching, the party learns that [[Vindristjarna]] has fled due to an attack by specters, leaving the party without immediate aerial support.
- The group secures the phylactery in a lead-lined portable hole to shield it from detection.
#### The Gathering of Tokens
- Armed with information and names, Riswynn and Kenzo investigate the Chapel of the Father for tokens related to the three martyrs memorialized there, finding three distinct death masks within a somber section of the chapel dedicated to martyrs. The masks are painted with closed eyes and tears, symbolizing mourning.
- Wellby uses ancestral halfling memory to uncover details about [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], a halfling victim connected to a tavern near the docks, revealing she was the owner of a popular tavern, the Laughing Wave, located near the docks of Drankor.
- The elf, [[Valanthe]], lived in a neighborhood north of the temple. The group decides to search her courtyard.
- [[Khemut of Targu]], a human with a foreign name, is suspected to have connections to the docks or a traveler’s quarter. 
- [[Minarith]], a peronar, one of the elves aligned with humans during the days of [[Hkar]], remains a mystery. 
- Leaving Seeker behind to guard the phylactery, the party travels through overgrown jungle and ruins to reach Volanthe’s courtyard.
- They encounter and defeat a horde of undead shades led by a shadow dreadlord. Riswynn’s divine power destroys 20 shades instantly, while Kenzo’s martial prowess helps defeat the dreadlord with precision strikes.
- The party locates a silver quill in the rubble, imbued with echoes of [[Valanthe]]’s soul.
- A cryptic and unauthenticated message from [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] on [[Vindristjarna]] raises concerns about its status, but the party decides nothing can be done immediately. 
- The party resolves to remain in the temple overnight, resting in its protective magic.
