## Narrative
We begin as [[Kenzo]] lands in a lush tropical jungle, on the dimly lit forest floor, among the think trunks and roots of the massive trees that make the canopy far above, surrounded by the vibrant sounds of life. [[Kenzo]]’s contemplation is quickly broken by a scream, a cry of distress from nearby. Rushing to investigate, [[Kenzo]] finds a lizardfolk man being attacked by two dinosaurs with corrupted auras. Quickly driving them off, the man introduces himself as [[Elazar]], and tells [[Kenzo]] a bit of where his is: very far away, far to the east and south, in the lizardfolk Kingdom of [[Orekatu]]. 

As [[Kenzo]] and [[Elazar]] return to the village of [[Bedez]], [[Elazar]] tells [[Kenzo]] a little bit about what has been happening: there is something that has disturbed the balance of the land here, something that has upset the equilibrium between elemental and spiritual forces and allowed elemental corruption to seep into the land. [[Elazar]], who calls himself too old to be an impulsive youngster, but too young to be a trusted elder, has been sounding the alarm without much success, and hopes that [[Kenzo]]’s testimony about the dinosaur attack will help sway the village elders. During the walk, [[Elazar]] tells [[Kenzo]] about some of the [[Kenzo#^304854|plants that grow in the jungle]], and the ki – called arima in the lizardfolk tongue – of the jungle, and they walk past a sacred spot where hutsu grows, imbued with the spirits of the lizardfolk ancestors. Communing with the jungle, [[Kenzo]] gifts his ki to the hutsu spirits, and begins to get a sense of what is wrong: something in the land is drawing too much spiritual energy to itself, leaving the jungle dry and empty of ki. And [[Elazar]] also tells [[Kenzo]] about the land - about how, in the ancient days when the gods walked the earth, the planes were all one, and when the multiverse was separated by Arhat and [[Malik]], strands of extraplanar energy still remained in Taelgar, connected the material plane to magic and spiritual power. One place, called the [[Azta Lekua]], or the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], is particularly rich in these connections. 

Arriving in the village of [[Bedez]], [[Kenzo]] settles in with [[Elazar]], learning the language and the lizardfolk teaches of the spiritual realm from him. [[Elazar]] is particularly invested, as the ancestors gave him a vision, that “the raindrop that will start the river flowing will be a stranger who carries the soul of an ancient forest with him.” During this time, [[Elazar]] introduces [[Kenzo]] to the matriarch of the village, [[Arrosa]], who is finally convinced by [[Kenzo]]’s report of the corruption in the dinosaur’s auras to listen to [[Elazar]] and request help to investigate what is happening. After several weeks of teaching, [[Elazar]] proclaims [[Kenzo]] is ready, and takes him to a place in the jungle, a cave filled with dark water, that [[Elazar]] says is close to the moment of creation, a place where [[Kenzo]] can see the spirit realms.

Here, [[Kenzo]] experiences a [[Kenzo Spirit Journey in Bedez|spirit journey]]. 

As you emerge from your vision, the echoes of the symphony of ki remain with you, the impression of the endless power and combinations of the spiritual power of the music of this realm, and the knowledge it would take many lifetimes to understand all of the possibilities of this symphony. Yet through this experience you have begun to see and hear and as you emerge, your senses are sharpened to the spiritual echoes in Taelgar.
