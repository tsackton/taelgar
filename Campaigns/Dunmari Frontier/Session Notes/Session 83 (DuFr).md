## Narrative

We begin in [[Uzgukhar]], at the celebration of the victory in the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]], after the unveiling of the statue of the hero [[Riswynn]] in the Plaza of Freedom. The party, and especially [[Riswynn]], are hailed as heroes and saviors, and the mood of relief and hope is palpable, overlaid on the mourning for those lost. As the evening progresses, Loremaster [[Azogar]] stands and in his frail but strong voice, speaks the full story of the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

*He tells of the first days of the [[People of the Rainbow]], before there was a cloak. He tells of Ilios the Bright, who fell through the world when he was just an infant, not yet chained to [[Thark]]'s will, and grew strong in the [[fey]] realm of [[Amberglow]], under a sunset sky free of [[Thark]]'s influence. Ilios, it is said, had a [[fey]] energy that could not be contained. His eyes shone with moonlight, and his swords flashed silver. He began to raid across the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], where small, disorganized groups of [[orcs]], families and tribes hidden from the Drankorian patrols lived. Ilios stole the unchained babies from these tribes, and brought them to [[Amberglow]], where The [[People of the Rainbow]] grew in secret, protected by the [[Cloudspinner]].* 

*And then Azagar speaks of the blackness that tore out the sun, the rift through which darkness leaked. The invasion of [[Amberglow]] by a far distant evil, something of no world. Ilios leapt through this blackness and severed
the cords that held this rift open, trapping himself to an unknown fate, but saving [[Amberglow]]. In honor of his sacrifice, the [[Cloudspinner]] wove the [[Cloak of Rainbows]], each thread plucked from the immortal sunsets of [[Amberglow]], each thread grasping the essence of [[the Riving]], the long pause, the splitting of the planes that created the [[Feywild]], and wrapping that energy of pulling, separating into a cloak that cut the wearer from the divine.*

*[[Azogar]]'s voice shifts, and he tells the story of the days in the world when the [[People of the Rainbow]] ventured forth, the quiet days, living lives of fields and flowers. In the story of their history, this was a remembered time of peace and happiness, but it could not last, for [[Azogar]] turns to the tale of [[Cha'mutte]], and [[Apollyon]].* 

*[[Cha'mutte]], it is said, traveled among the [[orcs]], teaching them, preaching the fate he sought for all the people of the world: freedom from the divine, as the [[People of the Rainbow]] had found. But then betrayal, whether intentional or not, telling [[Apollyon]] of the dream, of the cloak. And then the war, and loss, and defeat as [[Apollyon]] turned on the [[orcs]] and stole the cloak. That this because [[Apollyon]]'s downfall, as [[Cha'mutte]] turned on his former ally, was no comfort, and [[Azogar]] speaks bitter words as he tells how the cloak was lost and the [[People of the Rainbow]] scattered to hide in small groups where they could. 

*Until, after the [[Great War]], the hero [[Uzgash]] found the cloak unexpectedly amongst the ruins of a Dunmari fort, and with the cloak proclaimed the safe haven of [[Xurkhaz]], the land of the rising sun, a beacon of hope for the scattered [[People of the Rainbow]].* 

For the next few days, the party rests in [[Uzgukhar]], giving time for [[Wellby]] to recover from his death, and taking a well-deserved breather after the battle. [[Kenzo]] marks the Dunmari new year, the 192nd year of the [[Nayan Dynasty]], on January 23rd, beginning to develop his own new traditions of meditation and worship. As they prepare to leave, to head west to reconnect with Pava and [[Avaras]] and perhaps recruit [[Amil]] to join their crew, two orc women approach, [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]], asking to join the crew. That day, January 24th, is an uneventful day of travel over the [[Garamjala Desert]]. 

The next day, January 25th, the party receives another message from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], concerning [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|Rai's hand]]. The [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Rai's Hand|message]] is strange. After discussing the message for a short time, the party finds themselves passing over the now-empty city of [[Kharsan]], once Grash's base, and decides to investigate. [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] sees this as a perfect opportunity to be allowed to fly [[Vindristjarna]], but the party is not quite ready to allow this, it seems.

[[Kharsan]] seems relatively quiet. The party explores the palace, which was once Grash's headquarters, but now seems abandoned. The stables and great hall are ruined and cleared out; further searching uncovers a few restless haunted spirits of the plague dead in the old kitchens, which are easily dispatched. The remains of Grash's looting operation are also in the palace, along with a few treasures missed or destroyed. The most informative find is what looks like a planning room, with a map table and slate to draw on. It has been smashed, but from the available pieces and clues it seems pretty clear that [[Grash]] was planning on attacking [[Dunmar]] had he succeeded in getting the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

Exploring the rest of the city, the party casually slays a few more specters, and stumbles across the library, which is now a giant wasp nest, but the wasps are immediately destroyed by [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance spell. Although most of the paper has been shredded and turned to giant wasp nesting material, something might be salvageable, and it is packed for transport to [[Vindristjarna]] where perhaps [[Nuzkar]] will see what she can decipher from it. The party also briefly explores the orc warren, which is empty, but the central building contains a series of gruesome murals depicting [[Grash]] is battle, slaughtering defenseless innocents as the avatar of [[Thark]].   

The next morning, on January 26th, the party briefly returns to [[Kharsan]] with the orcs [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]]. [[Nuzkar]] is deeply saddened by the orc warren, mourning the hundreds of orcs who must have been born and bound to [[Thark]] here, and asks the party to burn it all. [[Kenzo]] and [[Riswynn]], as the orc warren burns, cleanse the spirits of the place as well, and see not just the orcs, but many others, especially the Dunmari who died in the [[Great War]], trapped between the plague consuming [[Kharsan]] and a wall of fire summoned to prevent them from reaching the safety of the [[Monastery of Bhishma]] nearby. As the fire burns, [[Kenzo]] feels [[Bhishma]]'s hand freeing the trapped, lost souls still stuck here, and [[Wellby]] briefly sees again the [[Land of the Dead|river of souls]] where he spent an hour before being resurrected by [[Riswynn]]'s magic. 

That afternoon, before departing [[Kharsan]], the party looks at the [[Broken Dunmari Sword Vision|broken Dunmari sword]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]]. The next day the party travels west, and arrives at [[Pava and Avaras' House]] on January 28th. Here, they meet [[Kethra]], a dwarven smith and great-grandaughter of [[Nora Silverspark]], who has traveled far searching for [[Riswynn]], hoping she'll be her mentor. They also speak at length with [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], who are very happy to see everyone looking so well. [[Pava]] wishs to record [[Delwath]]'s story, and is amazed at how [[Kenzo]] has started to reinterpret and expand the [[Bhishma]] traditions of storytelling in new ways, asking if [[Kenzo]] would take [[Amil]] with him as an apprentice. The party spends the next day just catching up and resting at [[Pava and Avaras' House]].

As they prepare to leave on January 30th, with [[Amil]] and [[Kethra]] joining the crew of [[Vindristjarna]], [[Pava]] updates them on the situation in [[Dunmar]], between [[Sura]] and [[Nayan Karnas]]. We end as the party considers intervening.
