## Narrative

Our session begins at dawn, in the harbor of Castrella, where the Dunmar Fellowship prepares to set sail on the halfling ship [[Summer's Breeze]], captained by [[Pippa Goodbarrow]], and guided, in part, by the human fisherman and navigator [[Martino]]. With the outgoing tide, the party sets sail, making good speed. The party is aiming to find Kazuro, a stoneborn hermit, who may be able to provide a magical way to breath water, allowing the party to search for the merfolk and the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]]. Martino suggests that Calcara Island, an uninhabited, rocky island off the coast, might be a good place for hermit, and Delwath confirms this by speaking with the tanshi. 

As the [[Summer's Breeze]] approaches the northern end of Calcara Island, Kenzo is able to sense the stoneborn's presence nearby, and a little bit of searching, guided by a friendly gannet and a playful seal, reveals the entrance to [[Kazuro]]'s cave. Rowing into the cave illuminated by an eerie blue light, they encounter a dock with steps leading up to a stoneborn hermit who questions their presence.

The stone-born hermit, Kazuro, appears annoyed and grumpy at the interruption. Delwath apologizes for the intrusion and explains their quest, mentioning they heard of Kazuro in Castrella, and explaining their need for water-breathing to reach the merfolk. Despite a stony reception, Kazuro invites the party to follow him, expressing frustration at favor-seekers. Kenzo attempts to interest Kazuro by offering stories that could echo into the future, and Riswynn compliments Kazuro’s hermitage, expressing the party’s noble intentions, but Kazuro is unswayed, if not entirely unsympathetic. 

Kazuro questions the party's origins and their reasons for requesting his help. Kenzo shares the party members' origins, emphasizing their quest to prevent an impending evil. Kazuro shows mixed emotions, including curiosity and hidden trauma, when Kenzo mentions fighting great evil, mentioning he has seen battle and loss in the War of the Dark Rift. 

Kenzo offers to establish a monastery to preserve Kazuro’s teachings and extend his legacy. Intrigued and pleased by the offer, Kazuro expresses his long-held wish to build a small school. Delwath suggests finding an apprentice for Kazuro, emphasizing the party’s journey and connections. This seems to sway Karuzo, and with the party's offer of aid in preserving his legacy, he begins pulling together the magical ingredients needed to produce the water breathing potions. He offers the party six doses of this concoction, which can transform lungs into gills, along with an antidote that can transform back. Taking the concoctions, the party departs, with a promise to return. 

Turning north, the party sails for two days under fair skies and following seas, heading for Tamaro Bay. After 48 hours of sailing, they approach the bay, noting a crude watchtower made of driftwood facing west, on an island off the coast. Wellby scouts, finding a man with  sunburned skin, matted hair, and worn-out clothes rooting for food on the leeward side of the island. 

Approaching the hermit, the party realizes he is confused, and Delwath, with magic, senses his thoughts are muddled, consuming by repeating a song in a strange language. Seeker notices his eyes are strange, and seem to have crashing waves in them. Realizing this must be some kind of curse or magic, Seeker manages to dispel the effect, and the hermit's demeanor shifts as he thanks the party. The hermit reveals he has been on the island for 10 years, unable to recall events clearly due to the magical possession, and mentions the last thing he remembers is the merfolk woman Caloria fleeing from her kin, to the island. He remembers drinking a vial of strange water -- a vial, Seeker learns, that was constructed on a different plane -- but the events are confused. He knows there was some trouble, some conflict, among the merfolk, and he fears Caloria is dead. 

This is confirmed by the party's search, which turns up the bones and golden bracelet of Caloria just offshore, washed up against some rocks. As they talk, the hermit -- whose name is Dorian -- recounts fragments of memories about Caloria being chased and leaving him with a sense of regret for drinking the cursed water. The party rests for a short while, and speaks more with Dorian, gaining insights regarding merfolk culture and etiquette. Dorian shares that merfolk settlements are west of their current location and hints at a significant event involving a jade garden and a green light. Before leaving, the party ensures Dorian is stable and offers to help him in the future. He refuses immediate travel, needing time to recover.

Returning to the Summer's Breeze in the late afternoon, the party proceeds westward, continuing into the night under clear skies. By midnight, Kenzo feels a tug from the jade, indicating they are close yet also far from their destination, as if it's both within 50 miles and infinitely distant. In the early morning hours before dawn, the wind dies completely, leaving the ship adrift in a zone of calm water. Kenzo, in a trance, senses a swirling vortex deep in the ocean, a portal to the Plane of Water. Telling the [[Summer's Breeze]] to sail back east as quickly as possible, the party consumes their 'gill pills' and dives into the water, experiencing a transformation as they grow gills and initially struggle, then adjust to breathing underwater.

As they descend, they feel a protective barrier and hear the whispers of a sentient ocean questioning their presence and intentions. The ocean's chant probes their identities and stories, creating a sense of watchfulness and judgment. The session ends as the party sinks deeper into the ocean, surrounded by these whispers and colors, hearing the echos of the sentient ocean repeating "Who are you?".
