### Detailed Summary

#### The Confrontation With Fausto
- The party teleports to the Temple of the Eight Divines in Drankor, and encounters Fausto, a chalyte knight, and seven war wizards. 
- Combat begins, with Kenzo using *Soul Sight* on Fausto, revealing Fausto's increased power and numerous magic tendrils extending from the [[Crown of Purity]], which Fausto wears. Three tendrils extend to the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], while another extends to the chalyte knight. 
- Kenzo uses a *Fireball* from the Necklace of Fireballs, damaging Fausto and the war wizards, but not killing anyone. 
- Fausto casts a spell, avoiding Seeker’s *Counterspell*.
- Seeker is dominated by Fausto, and forced to attack Riswynn with an eighth-level *Rune of Psychic Disruption*, incapacitating her. Delwath resists the charm. 
- Seeker grants Fausto Runic Inspiration under the charm.
- Wellby attempts to blind Fausto with his arrow, damaging him but not blinding him; the war wizards attack Kenzo, with limited effect, and are mostly destroyed when Delwath summons a pack of spirit lynxes, that tear into them. 
- The chalyte knight attacks Kenzo, knocking him back, but Kenzo is still able to stand and run to Seeker, using his cleansing touch to dispel Fausto's magic and freeing him, followed by a series of blows on Fausto. Riswynn recovers and prepares to rejoin the battle after being incapacitated.
#### The Crown of Purity
- Following Kenzo's flurry of attacks, Fausto laughs and a magical gray tendril from his crown snaps, preventing him from dropping unconscious under the violence of Kenzo's blows. 
- Fausto’s spellcasting is disrupted by Seeker’s *Counterspell*, frustrating his efforts to regain control of the battlefield.
- A magical gray tendril from his crown snaps with every significant attack, hinting at his connection to the crown and causing the party to reassess their strategy, realizing they need to remove the crown.
- Seeker attempts to remove the Crown using *Catapult* with a chain net, hitting the chalyte knight instead of Fausto.
- Riswynn targets Fausto with *Shatterstorm*, aiming to dislodge the crown through sheer force, but the crown remains fixed.
- Welby makes a sleight-of-hand attempt to grab the crown but fails to dislodge it.
- Delwath casts *Sleep*, successfully incapacitating Fausto temporarily; his attempt to remove the crown while Fausto is asleep results in massive psychic backlash, throwing him 40 feet back and dealing massive damage. 
- The chalyte knight awakens Fausto, maintaining the high-stakes tension of the battle.

#### Kenzo Claims the Crown
- Kenzo manages to grab the Crown, using Seeker's inspiration to help overcome the Crown's resistance. After a brief moment of struggle, the crown settles on his head.
- The chalyte knight kneels before Kenzo, recognizing his new authority.
- Fausto dies as the crown severs its connection, leaving him unable to sustain his life force.
- Kenzo acts quickly to take over the individuals bound to the Crown's control by Fausto. He orders [[Marius Cusico]], the general in charge of the Chardonian Expeditionary Legions in Dunmar, to surrender and retreat; he commands the chalyte knight into a meditative pose, testing his control; and he orders a number of bureaucrats and Chardonian officials, mostly in the chalyte trade and formerly controlled by Fausto, to try to reform Chardonian society, focusing on reparations and societal restructuring.
- The party debates the morality and implications of Kenzo’s actions, especially the use of the crown’s mind-control abilities.
- Concerns arise about the crown’s influence over Kenzo and whether his values will remain intact.
- Riswynn and others propose methods to test the crown’s impact on Kenzo’s soul, including soul sight and attunement tests.
- Kenzo argues for using the crown to enact positive change, acknowledging its potential risks but emphasizing the opportunity for justice.
- Other party members express reservations about the long-term consequences and whether such power can be wielded responsibly.
#### Riswynn’s Test and Shifting Power
- In order to test for corruption associated with the Crown, Kenzo gives it up, allowing Riswynn to attune, and uses Soul Sight to examine Riswynn for signs of corruption. 
- Riswynn attunes to the crown, prompting Kenzo to immediately fall unconscious as the Crown drains his life force. 
- The party stabilizes Kenzo, who regains consciousness but notes he cannot reattune to the crown.
- From Wellby's query of the halfling ancestral memory, the party learns that the crown predates human settlement on the continent and has a long history of both benevolent and malevolent wielders. Halfling memory lore reveals the crown only transfers ownership when the previous wearer is defeated, typically through death.
- Riswynn’s aura remains unchanged under soul sight, reassuring the party she has not been corrupted. She maintains Kenzo's orders to the controlled officials, to dismantle the chalyte trade.
- Party members voice concerns about the crown’s potential for corruption and the risks of keeping it.
- Delwath proposes destroying the crown immediately to prevent further harm.
- Kenzo argues for a brief delay to ensure key reforms are enacted before its destruction.
- Riswynn commits to using the crown responsibly and promises to honor Kenzo’s intentions while maintaining her independence.
- The party discusses the challenges of entering Apollyon’s tomb, particularly the red mist surrounding the structure.
- Seeker uses *Clairvoyance* to view the interior of the temple, noting a massive statue of Apollyon, rows of dark pillars, and an altar. The space appears unfinished, with murals and statues in various stages of completion.
- The red mist does not enter the temple but pools near the base of its steps. It is remembered as a deadly phenomenon tied to Cha'mutte’s magical plague.
- Wellby receives a message from Sura detailing an unexpected truce: General [[Marius Cusico]] has called for an end to hostilities in the [[Chardon-Dunmari War]]. A small contingent of wizards and soldiers refuse to comply, creating potential trouble.
- The party rests for the night, preparing to enter Apollyon's tomb the next morning.

#### Entering Apollyon’s Tomb
- The party travels through Drankor, relying on Riswynn's holy magic to clear their path of lingering undead. 
- Upon reaching the mist surrounding the tomb, the party flies to the dome’s roof and begins exploring.
- They find a door at the top of the dome and detect no traps or magical effects.
- Descending the narrow spiral staircase, the group enters the temple’s ground floor, emerging near the massive statue of Apollyon.
- The space is dimly lit, with flickering light filtering through the mist. Rows of black pillars and side chapels create an ominous atmosphere.
- Kenzo activates his aura abilities to detect Apollyon’s presence, realizing Apollyon is in the room. 

#### The Encounter with Apollyon
- Rising from behind a massive statue, Apollyon, in frayed imperial robes, greets the party with mocking grandeur.
- Apollyon’s appearance is ghastly: frayed flesh, glowing eyes, and a red scar dripping down his face. He floats 50 feet above the ground.
- Apollyon taunts the party, proclaiming himself the future god of posterity and warning them that their souls are now bound to his tomb.
- The party attacks, but Apollyon’s aura of necrotic energy deflects Wellby’s first arrow, showcasing his defensive capabilities.
- Delwath engages Apollyon but Apollyon relates in rage, showing is hatred of elves, and briefly cursing Delwath.
- Riswynn casts *Sunburst*, dealing radiant damage despite Apollyon twisting the magic to resist its full effect.
- Seeker summons a metal construct, which successfully lands several blows on Apollyon despite his counterattacks.
- Apollyon compels Kenzo to kneel with a command spell, briefly incapacitating him. 
- Blinded by Wellby’s arrow, Apollyon flees in mist form, descending through the floor into his inner sanctum. Before he departs, in anger and rage and hatred, he turns to Delwath and orders him to die with a word of power. Delwath falls dead. 
- Kenzo senses Apollyon’s soul moving deeper underground, leaving the party with the challenge of tracking him.
- The session ends as Riswynn uses Revivify to bring Delwath back to life, and the party contemplates the challenge of tracking Apollyon through his tomb.
