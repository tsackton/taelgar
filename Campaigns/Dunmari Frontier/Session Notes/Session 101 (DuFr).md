## Preparing to Fight the Herald of Gazankoa

  

Having traversed a sentient ocean and discovered the Merfolk city of Omi, the party learned that a Merfolk warlock named Baruvi had stolen jade from the city, inciting a war in the name of the creature Gazankoa. Baruvi opened a portal to the Plane of Water, now controlling Omi and the area beyond the portal, while the city remains encased by a sentient ocean, restricting any escape.

  

Seeker’s wand of Detect Magic identified a massive tentacled creature guarding the portal. To distract the Merfolk guards near the central building where the portal is, Seeker and the party used an animated stone crab to create a diversion. With the crab executing its task, the party prepared to sneak in. The DM reminded the party of their current predicament: they must defeat the tentacled creature to pass through the portal.

  

Seeker and Riswynn prepared to use Dimension Door to position themselves strategically for combat. They reviewed their strategy, planning to kill the creature here rather than risk it fleeing through the portal. Delwath and Seeker discussed using Sickening Radiance to gain an advantage. The creature, with high wisdom and charisma but low dexterity, was immune to lightning, thunder, charm, and fright, and resistant to cold and psychic damage. It wielded a trident and had a swarm of squid-like tentacles around its head.

  

Seeker suggested utilizing telekinesis and polymorphing into a creature with a swim speed for better underwater combat. Delwath explained his ability to use careful spell to shield the party from Sickening Radiance. The DM confirmed the creature couldn’t leave the room through the archways, making the portal its sole exit. The party coordinated their positions and timing, deciding to appear near the bottom left door within the Sickening Radiance area. The plan set, they rolled initiative, with invisible members gaining advantage. The initiative order was Delwath, Welby, Riswynn, Seeker, and Kenzo, with Delwath repositioning to act just before the creature.

  

## The Fight against the Herald

  

The party strategically positioned themselves around the tentacled creature guarding the portal to the Plane of Water. Welby used his swimming speed to reposition and attempted a Cunning Strike to disarm the creature of its trident. Successfully hitting, Welby grabbed the trident and swam away, using Cunning Action to Disengage.

  

Delwath cast Sickening Radiance, ensuring it covered both doors and the creature. The creature retaliated by attacking Welby with a claw and tentacle, dealing damage and grappling him. Riswynn entered the Sickening Radiance and cast Sunbeam, dealing radiant damage. Seeker used Telekinesis to pull the creature into the Sickening Radiance, breaking its grapple on Welby. Kenzo attacked the creature with stunning strikes, successfully stunning it.

  

Seeker maintained the creature's restraint with Telekinesis. Five kelp minions animated and attacked Welby, dealing significant damage. Kenzo got knocked against the ceiling and restrained by a water blast from the portal. Despite being poisoned, Welby successfully attacked the creature again. Delwath landed multiple substantial hits, assisted by Seeker's inspiration. Riswynn’s Sunbeam continued to damage the creature as it failed its saving throw. Seeker kept the creature restrained with Telekinesis, and Kenzo’s attacks left it severely wounded. The Sickening Radiance and party attacks killed the minions and eventually, Delwath’s successful strike blinded and killed the creature.

  

## The Plane of Water

  

Delwath suggested healing before proceeding through the portal, with Riswynn offering healing spells and Delwath proposing potions. Welby reported being down 60 HP, Seeker down 30 HP, while Delwath and Kenzo were at full health. The DM praised the strategy of stealing the trident from the creature. Riswynn cast a healing spell, leading to some discussion about spell levels and modifiers, with Delwath opting to heal Welby. The party discussed using potions to save spell slots and prepared to go through the portal.

  

Deciding to cast invisibility, the party proceeded through the portal. The DM described the Plane of Water: a coral platform suspended in an infinite expanse of water, bioluminescent light, and various structures including a guard tower and manta ray pens. Riswynn stepped through first, becoming visible to the guards who attacked, initiating combat.

  

Combat began as the guards rolled initiative. Two guards rushed towards the manta ray pens, two headed for the huts, and six others surrounded Riswynn. Welby shot the captain, disarming him. Seeker cast Slow on the guards, Riswynn cast Spirit Guardians, Delwath used Misty Step to attack the guards, and Kenzo took out four of them. The fight continued with Welby shooting guards and Seeker using Catapult. Riswynn and Delwath engaged in melee combat. The guards attempted to raise the alarm but were defeated by Kenzo’s relentless attacks.

  

## Exploring the Portal Platform

  

Delwath suggested the party quickly get under cover and discussed the various structures around them with Seeker. The DM described the area, including huts, a building connected to the edge, and a flat platform, noting that two guards were heading towards these structures. Seeker speculated that the platform might serve as a parking spot for large aquatic creatures. Riswynn and Delwath considered sending a fish to scout, but the DM reminded them that most fauna might be elementals.

  

Seeker used Clairvoyance to spy inside a hut, finding four sleeping murfolk and some gear. Delwath and Riswynn debated taking a short rest, considering the sleeping guards’ presence. Kenzo expressed his need for healing, and Delwath suggested deciding on a rest before using healing spells. The DM clarified that the sleeping guards were unaware of the previous battle due to the distance and speed of the fight.

  

Delwath performed Detect Magic as a ritual while Seeker used Clairvoyance. Riswynn identified a silver rapier, noting its nautical design and magical properties. The DM described the scene, including manta rays milling around a pen and various structures such as a guard tower and huts. Delwath suggested hiding or short resting in an empty hut. Kenzo communicated with seaweed, learning about danger from small feet and a 'nasty one' who controlled the water but was stopped by 'friends.'

  

The DM described the manta rays as docile elementals, allowing Welby to ride one. The party debated killing or capturing the sleeping guards. The DM detailed the guards’ possessions, including a magical swirling crystal shard on a silver necklace and various coins. Delwath found a broken wooden pipe with the initials 'MT,' suggesting a connection to Milo the halfling adventurer. The party weighed whether to interrogate the guards or proceed with their mission. Delwath decided to scry on Milo using the pipe to determine his status and location.

  

## Interrogating the Merfolk Guard

  

The DM emphasized the urgency of acting before the alarm could force the party into combat. Delwath proposed interrogating one murfolk guard and killing the rest. The party agreed, sneaking into the huts and murdering all but one guard. The surviving guard had a polished mother-of-pearl ornament. Delwath began scrying using a silver bowl, revealing Milo transformed into a shark-headed halfling with tentacle arms, working with similar creatures at an archaeological sorting station, cruelly supervised by a murfolk who took a pictogram fragment.

  

The party debated their quest, distinguishing between the main quest and the potential side quest involving Milo. Riswynn and Seeker discussed the interrogation’s direction, and Delwath concluded the scry, deciding to take a short rest before moving on. As the scry ended, the rest of the party returned, finding trinkets including a broken brass compass engraved with 'Storm Dancer' and assorted coins. They tied up the murfolk guard and hid him in the barracks.

  

## Decisions and Travel

  

Delwath suggested leaving a strong impression on the captured guard that the party was friendly and seeking Milo. The party debated whether to rest or proceed directly to find the jade. After a brief interruption, Kenzo rejoined the strategy discussion. They decided to take a short rest, encountering technical difficulties with hit dice mechanics. Post-rest, Delwath and Riswynn discussed their next move, with Delwath favoring going after the jade.

  

The DM clarified the jade’s importance: it keeps the portal to the Plane of Water open and will close it if removed. Delwath considered using his shield’s ability to send a ghostly lynx to communicate with Milo, but the party decided against it. The DM explained the logistics of using the lynx for scouting or measuring distance. The group decided to proceed quickly to rescue Milo, believing time was of the essence.

  

Delwath expressed interest in attuning to the magical rapier if no one else claimed it. The DM detailed the rapier’s abilities, including resistance to damage or an escape maneuver, along with extra lightning damage. The party mounted manta rays and followed a bioluminescent path towards Milo.

  

The DM described the eerie underwater journey through pitch blackness, guided by faint glowing markers and the manta rays’ silver light. After about an hour, Welby spotted a faint light, revealing a large coral tower with a massive translucent bubble about 1,000 feet across. The party noticed two murfolk guards atop the tower, seemingly not on high alert and possibly playing cards.

  

## Meeting Halfling Prisoners

  

The party observed a giant bubble growing off the side of a coral tower guarded by two murfolk. Riswynn questioned the bubble’s size and entry points, while the DM suggested it could house what they saw in the scrying vision. Kenzo confirmed the party was not invisible.

  

Riswynn skillfully steered manta rays to circle the bubble, getting closer to assess the situation. Seeker suggested Detect Magic, but the DM noted they needed to be closer. Kenzo sensed eight halflings inside the bubble. Delwath and Seeker discussed entry methods, including Dimension Door and dispelling the magic. Seeker used Dispel Magic, creating a temporary opening, and the party quickly swam through before it closed.

  

Inside the bubble, they encountered debris-filled, inky blackness. They moved slowly, using Delwath’s Shape Water spell to clear sections. Delwath and Kenzo avoided sharp coral. Reaching a platform, they stayed below it to avoid detection. Welby scouted above, seeing clear water, halfling prisoners, and murfolk guards. Telepathically contacting a halfling, he learned they were aware of the situation and the guards’ laxity.

  

The halflings had been searching for pictograms, part of a larger scheme. The prisoner mentioned a structure on the platform housing a murfolk and enslaved elementals. Despite stings from nearly invisible jellyfish, Seeker and Kenzo remained unaffected. The prisoner indicated the need for their arcane focus for effective spells and escape. The DM suggested the next session would involve investigating the platform's structure for further information and potential rescue.
