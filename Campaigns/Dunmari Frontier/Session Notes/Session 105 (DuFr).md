## Narrative

Our session begins aboard the airship [[Vindristjarna]], floating above the jungle coastline near the Sea of Storms, a The followers aboard the ship are engaged in various activities: Faldrak is piloting the ship, Aygul is recovering below deck with Nuzkar tending to her, Amil is sparring, Egnir is observing the landscape, and the halflings Tilly and Milo are stationed at the bow. The party discusses their location, determining they are about 20 miles from the coast. Kenzo reveals that the last piece of Rai's jade vanished into a storm over the ocean. The party decides to investigate a visible cave below them, which previously held the jade. Seeker and Kenzo debate the jade's disappearance, with Kenzo noting that he last sensed it flying southeast over the ocean. Using 'Commune with Nature,' Kenzo senses disturbances and sentient minds in the jungle, particularly in the cave, near a western waterfall, and about 20 miles east. Welby uses a vulture to scout and discovers a large tree entangled with thorny vines.


The party descends from Vindristjarna via a rope ladder and enters the cave. The entrance is wide but low, and the interior is overgrown with vines and rubble. There are two exits: one that goes back and down, and another that goes left and stays level. Seeker picks up a piece of rubble while Delwath asks about the location of the sentient creatures Kenzo sensed, but it is unclear which direction to take. Delwath suggests taking the passage that goes back and down. The party proceeds in the order of Welby, Delwath, Seeker, and Kenzo. The passage slopes gently downward and becomes narrow, forcing Kenzo and Delwath to crawl. After about 30 feet, Welby halts, noticing a drop into a large cavern below, about 40 feet down. They observe odd rippling effects on the stone floor and amplified echoes of dripping water. Seeker uses his stone sense and detects a vein of silver about 200 feet away. Finding no evidence of foot traffic, Seeker deduces that the cave inhabitants likely lack feet. Delwath considers climbing down but decides against it due to the difficulty. Welby uses acrobatics to descend and notices a large passageway at the far end of the cavern with blurry air patches. The party decides to cast Fly to navigate the cavern, with Welby leading and pointing out the blurry air. They encounter zones with shifting gravity but manage to navigate them efficiently. They reach an area with a mist that falls like rain but sounds louder. Delwath uses Shape Water to freeze a cube of mist, which turns into charcoal and sparks upon hitting the ground. They create a stone apparatus using Seeker's Performance of Creation to divert the mist safely, allowing them to pass underneath and proceed to the next passageway.


The party enters a large cavern with a sloped floor leading to a pool of strange mud with sharp borders. They are confronted by several elemental creatures: an air-ape clumped with stone, a whirlwind of mud and lightning, and two fire lizards surrounded by ice. Combat begins with Welby shooting the air-earth elemental, dealing significant damage. Kenzo engages the fire-ice elemental, learning it is immune to cold and fire damage, and distracts it with an aura strike, though he misses several attacks. Seeker uses Erupting Earth to damage the fire-ice elemental. Delwath casts Synaptic Static, affecting three elementals, causing psychic damage and reducing their attack rolls. The elementals retaliate with restraining wind and a lightning storm that damages Delwath. Welby and Kenzo struggle but manage to break free and continue attacking. Kenzo receives reminders to use his deflection abilities. Welby identifies bats trying to escape, which do not seem ordinary. Delwath dialogues with the bats, revealing they speak Elvish and fear the elementals. Delwath casts Misty Step, intercepts the bats, and assures them of the party's help. The elementals are gradually defeated through coordinated attacks, with Kenzo finishing the last elemental. The party is left in darkness, with Delwath conversing with confused bats.


The bats, having never encountered humanoids, are confused. Delwath reassures them, asking if any are hurt and if they need help. The DM confirms these bats were sensed by Kenzo. The bats remain nervous and converse about the strange two-legged creatures. Delwath offers food, noting their emaciation. The bats, resembling large fruit bats, cautiously accept the fruit. Delwath uses his magical cooking pouch to provide more fruit. The bats take the fruit and head to the far end of the cave. Delwath follows with his lynx spirit to gather more food. Welby explores the room, avoiding mud patches. Seeker tests the patches, which make pebbles vanish. Kenzo senses about 60 bats hiding in the tunnels. Delwath follows to a larger space where emaciated bats cluster. An older bat, Echo, confronts Delwath, who reassures Echo about food and shares his heritage story. The bats relax as food news spreads. They discuss learning to speak and recent events, including chaos creatures and events involving Kenzo and Delwath clones. Echo reveals the jade was seen months ago by a younger bat, Pip, who found it while exploring. They learn more about the bats' living conditions and the jade's disappearance.


Delwath asks the bats to show where Rai's jade was found. Pip agrees, expressing a desire to leave the cave. They depart, and Pip is surprised by the floating Vindristjarna. At the clearing where Pip found the jade, they find nothing of interest. They decide to head to the eldest tree, Canopy, hoping for more information. They take a short rest on Vindristjarna en route. Kenzo speaks with plants, learning that Canopy was surrounded by vines weeks ago, causing jungle chaos. They learn Canopy remembers learning to speak.

The party flies closer to the massive vines around a large tree in a grove, noting the perfect circle of trees and writhing vines covering a compressed plant knot at the roots. Wellby volunteers to scout. Within 30 feet of the knot, a vine strikes him, restraining him. Wellby telepathically reports back and escapes using acrobatics. The session ends as the party prepares to face the vines and thorns in combat.
