## Narrative

We begin as the battle ends, and the party collects and sorts through the gear from [[Kadmos]] and company. [[Kadmos]], and the sorcerer [[Evelina]], lie dead on the ground: [[Evelina]] killed in battle, [[Kadmos]] executed afterward. The remainder of the enemies are trapped in the mirror, after having been put to sleep by [[Delwath]]'s magic. After tending to [[Lubash]], [[Riswynn]] turns to [[Seeker]] to try to remove whatever icy curse clings to him, despite [[Seeker]]'s insistence he is fine. However, normal restoration magic does not seem remove the curse - instead, it just makes it briefly visible, as a small icy flying gargoyle-like creature clinging to [[Seeker]]'s back. Something of ice is needed to drag the curse away from [[Seeker]]. [[Delwath]] attempts to banish it with his sword, but as it is fey, not a fiend, this has no effect. Deciding this is a problem for the morning, the party rests, planning to interrogate the prisoners in the morning.

The next morning, the party has a late breakfast with [[Lubash]], [[Murook]], and [[Azogar]]. They report the recent news, that [[Grash]] has begun slaughtering his army, seeking to turn them into undead. There is some discussion of the metaphysics of this situation, and whether the undead are still bound by [[Thark]] and thus unable to enter [[Xurkhaz]], but ultimately it seems the risen [[Orcs|orc]] zombies are a more serious threat than [[Lubash]] anticipated. Several options, including protecting the city from undead with [[Riswynn]]'s magic while those who can flee, are discussed.

The party then interrogates the prisoners, starting with [[Valius]], the archer twin. After his cell is combined with [[Vargus]]', his twin brother, [[Valius]] begins to speak in response to [[Delwath]]'s patient questions. He speaks of how he and his brother were mercenaries after they left the [[Chardonian Legion]], traveling around, searching for a rumored lost dragon treasure in the mountains on the border of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], that kind of thing. But they were always more inclined to drink and eat and talk at pubs than actually find treasure, and eventually broke they ended up back in [[Chardon]], signing up to hunt for treasure for the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. After a few successful trips, [[Fausto]] sought them out, paying well but always pushing them to be a little more ruthless. When [[Vargus]] tried to get out, [[Fausto]] did something to him, with this cold iron crown, the [[Crown of Purity]]. From them on, [[Valius]] did what [[Fausto]] said, to keep his brother alive. Eventually, they were sent with the sorcerer [[Evelina]] to travel east, looking for old artifacts from [[Drankor]], ending up in the [[Orcs]]' territory, spying and scouting. From [[Valius]], the party also learns a little more about [[The Cleansed]]. Their memories and personalities are not gone, just suspended: occasionally [[Vargus]] would have lucid moments, and talk about it feeling like a fog had lifted, but then the mists would close in again. 

Next, the party talks to [[Antonia]]. It is clear after talking to her for a few minutes that she quite dislikes [[Orcs]] and undead, and believes that [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] is destined to be restored to greatness. [[Antonia]] does not know that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] is undead; she clearly believes that finding the cloak, scepter, and crown is all required to restore him to life, to resurrect him. She believes that [[Vargus]], [[Vola]], and [[Hektor]] volunteered to be purified, cleansed of their impure blood, and the process went wrong. She believes [[Fausto]] is working to fix the process, to make it safe, so all humans can be cleansed and purified for the new dawn of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. It takes some time, but eventually [[Delwath]] convinces her that [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] is a trapped undead and [[Fausto]] seeks to free him, not resurrect him. This seems to shatter her resistance, and she tells the party what she knows. [[Grash]] has presumably spoken via Sending with [[Casian]], and is likely on his way to attack the city. He suspects the party has the [[Scepter of Command]], from talking to dead werewolves outside [[Tokra]], and if he gets the cloak and the scepter, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] can return in full power. The party agrees to leave her in the mirror for a year or two, and possibly release her in exile in the north, near [[Voltara]], when [[Grash]] and [[Fausto]] are dead.

After some discussion, it is decided that [[Riswynn]] will remain and defend the city from the undead, with her divine magic, while the rest of the party flies north to destroy the scepter, preventing [[Grash]] from ever obtaining it. With this decided, the party speaks with [[Casian]], who is dismissive and rude, insisting he will be rescued when [[Grash]] comes, up until the minute he is slain. 

Finally, as the days passes noon, the party looks at the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]], seeing the [[Mantle of Protection Vision]]. Then, [[Riswynn]] begins casting the Hallow spell, to bless the throne room, which takes 24 hours. The next day, as the spell casting is done, [[Seeker]] is reluctantly dragged into the room, freeing him of the fey curse of ice. 

We end as [[Riswynn]] sets herself to casting Forbiddance, and the rest of the party turns north on [[Vindristjarna]] to destroy the scepter.
