## Narrative

We start as the party takes a brief breather in the shadow of a barn in a field of wheat, about a half-mile south of [[Chardon]], having just fled from [[Fausto]]. During the course of a tense day, [[Wellby]] sneaks upriver and finds a place where the party can sleep, unmolested. The next morning, as dawn comes, the party discusses the situation and decides to ride as fast as possible east, with one person riding at a time while the rest of the party remains in the mirror. While [[Wellby]] heads to the nearby market town to buy horses, [[Delwath]] attempts to scry, first on [[Marcella]] (which fails), and then on [[Fausto]] (which succeeds). [[Fausto]] is finishing breakfast, an invisible servant carrying his dishes away, and then takes out a silver mirror with an elaborate jeweled border decoration, and begins casting scrying. 

The rest of the day and into the night, [[Wellby]] rides hard, changing horses frequently. He passes the wine town of [[Metium]] around 3 pm, before running out of steam around midnight about 85 miles east of [[Chardon]]. The next morning, get an early start in the pre-dawn light and ride all day, making another 60 miles with the horses tiring around 9 pm. Pass a tall gray standing monolith stone around 130 miles east of [[Chardon]]. May possibly be associated with the fey, somehow; later learn that this is one of several treaty stones marking the agreements between humans and [[Elves|elves]] in these lands, thousands of years ago. Camp at 9 pm, and rest.

The next day proceeds similarly, pushing 45 miles before one of the horses pulls a muscle and cannot continue. [[Wellby]] gives him away to an apricot farmer named Marcus, and then finds a place to camp near the city of [[Erlona]], a substantial city with a large coliseum. Near the city, [[Wellby]] also passes an army of perhaps 500 Chardonian soldiers setting camp on their way east. The night’s sleep is interrupted by nightmares: a shadow creature with a long spear wrapped in darkness and a red and black mask appears, saying that he is coming for them.

However, the horses get their rest, and the next morning the party decides it is time for fresh horses, so [[Wellby]] spends the day going into [[Erlona]] to buy new horses and sell the old. He also maintains the cover story that he has made it to his caravan. The rest of the day, [[Kenzo]] takes over, with everyone else in the mirror, making it another 60 miles before calling it a night. 

That night, while the party tries to rest, a pack of shadow dogs attacks, seemingly attempting to get away with blood from party members. However, they are all killed, despite the heroic [[Ladder]] running away in fear. Trying to rest after the battle, [[Seeker]] is again beset by nightmares, this time of the shadow dogs hunting him and tearing him to pieces, and does not get a rest. 

The next day, the party sets out again, with [[Kenzo]] on the horses, but he is unable to keep up the pace [[Wellby]] was able to set before. After traveling about 30 miles, the horses tired from being frightened of the shadow dogs, the party takes a rest, and [[Wellby]] takes over again. After traveling another 20 miles, the horses are exhausted and the party camps. 

During the journey, [[Delwath]] also spends time Scrying, and sees [[Marcella]] and [[Sura]]. [[Marcella]] is in the mountains to the east, sleeping. [[Sura]] is praying in her tent, reading a prayer book waiting for someone, and then a messenger arrives. He says he has ridden all the way to [[Tokra]], and no one there knew the secret of unpetrifying a person. [[Govir]], at the [[Archives]], is doing some research to see what he can learn, but no one knows how the sword caused this. 

Trying to sleep, [[Seeker]] again has nightmares, of the shadow hunter catching up to him and saying “I found you!”. The rest of the party is watching in the dream mirror, and immediately tries to wake [[Seeker]], as the sound of howls echoes in from near the camp, and the session ends.
