## Notes and Information

- (DR:: 1748-07-13) *(Eudomes Mirror)*: See a the [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision]] in [[The Mirror of the Past]] (recharge:: mirror)

## Narrative

We begin with the tale of the [[The Dunmari Monsoon|monsoons that have just begun]], as the party rests in [[Tokra]], waiting for their [[Portable Hole]] to be ready and to begin the journey to [[Darba]], and planning on wrapping up a few loose ends. The first of which is looking at the [[Pandemonium Scroll|scroll]] associated with [[Pandemonium]], recovered from the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], in [[The Mirror of the Past]]. As [[Seeker]] unrolls the scroll to hold it to the mirror, the runes shift and squirm and reach out to him, but he resists whatever effect might have occurred and [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision|sees the following]].

The next morning, the party explores the giant tree, going so far as to climb to the top, where they see the first buds of the new leaves beginning to appear, and [[Kenzo]] communes with the tree. Despite his wishes, a branch does not fall for him. However, later that afternoon, his old mentor [[Rishi]] gives him a branch from the tree that he had been saving for [[Kenzo]] when he was ready, telling him that it must be shaped into a staff by [[Kenzo]]’s own hand. The rest of the party sells treasure and gets organized for the journey to [[Darba]].

On the morning of July 15th, the party speaks with [[Basu]], who delivers the [[Portable Hole]] along with four rules: 

1) never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal; 
2) no fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 
3) be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 
4) don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane. 

After some conversation in which [[Basu]] gets increasingly dubious about the safety of handing over the item, he relents and turns over the [[Portable Hole]]. 

The party leaves [[Tokra]] on the morning of July 16th, escorting [[Johar]] and heading northwest on the main trade road before turning south and west in a few days for the direct overland route to [[Darba]]. The first two days are uneventful, as the party rests in inns each night, the main notable landmark a soaring night-glowing single arch bridge of Drankorian make, over a now-seasonal river.

The evening of July 18th, after three days on the road, the party reaches the crossroads. The [[~Crossroads Caravanserai~]] is busy with travelers, including some halflings and a Chardonian. [[Wellby]] speaks with the halflings, brothers, [[Alton Greenleaf]] and [[Lyle Greenleaf]]. They’ve come from the west, heading for [[Tokra]]. They report news of kobold attacks near [[Songara]], hard-to-believe rumors of a dragon on the trail to [[Darba]], and that the Chardonian was traveling with a group of four others that they passed on the road heading west yesterday, all adventurers.

The party then speaks with [[Marcella]]. She tells them that she in here because she is waiting for details from [[Drusa]], in [[Tokra]], about the kobold threat near [[Songara]], which she and her companions have been tasked with dealing with on their way back to [[Chardon]], while the party tells her they are heading south and west to [[Darba]]. As the party exchanges stories for stories, they learn that she and her companions were traveling in the [[Garamjala Desert]] searching for lost ruins of [[Drankor]] buried in the sands. [[Delwath]] gives her the letters from [[Stormcaller Tower]], and she reveals they didn’t find much in the desert, the site of a battle from the time of the [[Great War]] with a few treasures, but none of the Drankorian ruins they hoped to find. [[Marcella]] also speaks of [[Orcs|orcs]]: they found a hunting party, who were chasing free [[Orcs|orcs]] in the name of [[Grash]]. The party tells her about their encounter with [[Grash]], then, and the conversation turns to [[Vola]]. [[Marcella]] traveled with her, and is relieved to hear news of her. [[Delwath]] and [[Marcella]] then trade stories of ancient artifacts: [[Delwath]] speaks of a [[Circlet of Foreknowledge|circlet]] set with a single white gem that gives perfect foreknowledge, and [[Marcella]] speaks of a [[Ring of Undying|ring]] that lets one cheat death forever. 

Finally the conversation turns to the [[Great Library]] and the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. While [[Marcella]] seems to be quite cagey (lying, according to [[Kenzo]]’s [[Bhishma]]-enhanced sense about stories) about who she has traveled with or knows, she does tell the party that the Society is open to all, and if they make it to [[Chardon]] they should ask after [[Crispus]], a senior archivist in the Library who is in charge of many of the expeditions to collect magical artifacts from the past. 

As the conversation ends and the party talks into the night, [[Johar]] mentions the rumors that [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]] had made a deal with [[Chardon]] in the past few years, giving them access to the treasures lost in the [[Nashtkar]] in exchange for magical aid. We end as the party turns in for the night, preparing to take the potentially dragon and bandit infested [[Tokra-Darba Road|road]] to [[Darba]] in the morning.
