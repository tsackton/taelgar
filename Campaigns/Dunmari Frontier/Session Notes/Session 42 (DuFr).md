%% Intro on monsoons
Across Dunmar, the coming of the rains marks the turning of the seasons, the transition from the hot, dusty summer at the end of the dry season, to the lush green of the monsoon.

In the south and west, on the other side of the Yuvanti Mountains, it has been raining for weeks already. The rivers are in flood, the Nayan and the Shrev overflowing their banks and nourishing the fields and farms of western Dunmar. The grass and trees of the dry savannah are springing to life, as animals -- wild and domestic -- feast on the fresh shoots.

In Darba, nearly due east of Tokra, the rains arrived a week ago. Here, the influence of the Nevos Sea modulates the dry season, and the small rivers that cascade from the foothills of the Yuvanti and Chataan Mountains to the coast flow year round. Still, the people of the Darba coast celebrate the Day of the Renewal, like all Dunmari, and the monsoon rains refresh the land here as well.

Over the past week, the rains have moved slowly north, across the plains of central Dunmar. First, falling in the foothills of the Yuvanti mountains, and in the Copper Hills west of Tokra, feeding the rivers and dry washes that flow into the Hara. Then, reaching Tokra and Songara and bringing life to the dry, brown grasslands.

It will still be some time, a week or more, until the monsoons finally reach the northern peaks, perhaps quenching the fires still burning around Eudomes' tower, washing clean the streams of Raven's Hold, bringing flowers and color to the canyons of Karawa and Gomat.

In Askandi, to the south, in the deepest part of the rain shadow of the Yuvanti peaks, the first sign of the monsoon will be the flood of the Hara, as the rain falling on the plains of Tokra flows downriver. What little rain does reach Askandi will not fall for nearly a month, long after the fields have been planted and the first crops sown in the fertile lands on the banks of the Hara.

Further east, in the depths of the [[Garamjala Desert]], the rain will come last of all, its energy spent. Only a few thunderstorms will likely arrive in the dry deserts of the high plateau, but even that trickle of water will be enough for the Kharja to spring to life, for the deserts to bloom, and for the life that has lain dormant, waiting for water to burst forth.

But now, as the rains have just started falling in Tokra, the lands north and east still wait for relief, while our adventurers turn to the west, leaving behind the deserts and the frontiers for the settled heart of western Dunmar.

## Narrative

We begin as the party rests in [[Tokra]], waiting for their [[Portable Hole]] to be ready and to begin the journey to [[Darba]], and planning on wrapping up a few loose ends. The first of which is looking at the [[Pandemonium Scroll|scroll]] associated with [[Pandemonium]], recovered from the lair of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], in [[The Mirror of the Past]]. As [[Seeker]] unrolls the scroll to hold it to the mirror, the runes shift and squirm and reach out to him, but he resists whatever effect might have occurred and [[Pandemonium Scroll Vision|sees the following]].

The next morning, the party explores the giant tree, going so far as to climb to the top, where they see the first buds of the new leaves beginning to appear, and [[Kenzo]] communes with the tree. Despite his wishes, a branch does not fall for him. However, later that afternoon, his old mentor [[Rishi]] gives him a branch from the tree that he had been saving for [[Kenzo]] when he was ready, telling him that it must be shaped into a staff by [[Kenzo]]’s own hand. The rest of the party sells treasure and gets organized for the journey to [[Darba]].

On the morning of July 15th, the party speaks with [[Basu]], who delivers the [[Portable Hole]] along with four rules: 

1) never open an extradimensional portal instead another extradimensional portal; 

2) no fire (or acid, or similar effects) in the hole, because eventually the silk of the cloth itself will burn and the item will be destroyed; 

3) be careful which direction you open it – if you put it on the ceiling everything will fall out; and 

4) don’t rip the material from the outside or especially from the inside, as any tear can rip apart and eject everything inside into a random other plane. 

After some conversation in which [[Basu]] gets increasingly dubious about the safety of handing over the item, he relents and turns over the [[Portable Hole]]. 

Finally, the party leaves [[Tokra]] on the morning of July 16th, escorting [[Johar]] and heading northwest on the main trade road before turning south and west in a few days for the direct overland route to [[Darba]]. The first two days are uneventful, as the party rests in inns each night, the main notable landmark a soaring night-glowing single arch bridge of Drankorian make, over a now-seasonal river.

The evening of July 18th, after three days on the road, the party reaches the crossroads. The [[~Crossroads Caravanserai~]] is busy with travelers, including some halflings and a Chardonian. [[Wellby]] speaks with the halflings, brothers, [[Alton Greenleaf]] and [[Lyle Greenleaf]]. They’ve come from the west, heading for [[Tokra]]. They report news of kobold attacks near [[Songara]], hard-to-believe rumors of a dragon on the trail to [[Darba]], and that the Chardonian was traveling with a group of four others that they passed on the road heading west yesterday, all adventurers.

The party then speaks with [[Marcella]]. She tells them that she in here because she is waiting for details from [[Drusa]], in [[Tokra]], about the kobold threat near [[Songara]], which she and her companions have been tasked with dealing with on their way back to [[Chardon]], while the party tells her they are heading south and west to [[Darba]]. As the party exchanges stories for stories, they learn that she and her companions were traveling in the [[Garamjala Desert]] searching for lost ruins of [[Drankor]] buried in the sands. [[Delwath]] gives her the letters from [[Stormcaller Tower]], and she reveals they didn’t find much in the desert, the site of a battle from the time of the [[Great War]] with a few treasures, but none of the Drankorian ruins they hoped to find. [[Marcella]] also speaks of [[Orcs]]: they found a hunting party of [[Orcs]] who were hunting free [[Orcs]] in the name of [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]]. The party tells her about their encounter with [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]], then, and the conversation turns to [[Vola]]. [[Marcella]] traveled with her, and is relieved to hear news of her. [[Delwath]] and [[Marcella]] then trade stories of ancient artifacts: [[Delwath]] speaks of a [[Circlet of Foreknowledge|circlet]] set with a single white gem that gives perfect foreknowledge, and [[Marcella]] speaks of a [[Ring of Undying|ring]] that lets one cheat death forever. 

FInally the conversation turns to the [[Great Library]] and the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. While [[Marcella]] seems to be quite cagey (lying, according to [[Kenzo]]’s [[Bhishma]]-enhanced sense about stories) about who she has traveled with or knows, she does tell the party that the Society is open to all, and if they make it to [[Chardon]] they should ask after [[Crispus]], a senior archivist in the Library who is in charge of many of the expeditions to collect magical artifacts from the past. 

As the conversation ends and the party talks into the night, [[Johar]] mentions the rumors that Karnas had made a deal with [[Chardon]] in the past few years, giving them access to the treasures lost in the [[Nashtkar]] in exchange for magical aid. We end as the party turns in for the night, preparing to take the potentially dragon and bandit infested road to [[Darba]] in the morning.
