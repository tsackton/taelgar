You are looking out from a market stall, maybe in [[Karawa]] or [[Tokra]], the booth of a trader in trinkets and fine accessories. A woman approaches, finely dressed, but her face hidden by a traveling cloak. She picks up the fan, and a few other items, and you are tossed in saddlebags with several well-made riding dresses and some jewelry and other accessories. Later, as you are drawn out of the saddlebags, the woman has changed into a hag, into [[Agata]].

You are watching from a table in [[Agata]]'s hut. [[Agata]] is standing next to an [[Orcs|orc]], and is working a spell over her. Slowly, you watch the form of the [[Orcs|orc]] transform, grow slimmer and taller, her skin turn light brown, her hair grow smooth and long. [[Agata]] hands her a riding dress - well-tailored and well-made, as well as some accessories, the fan, and a pouch of coin. [[Agata]] speaks to her, repeating what are maybe instructions, and the scene shifts.

You are a tent with [[Sura]], in disguised [[Orcs|orc]]'s hand. [[Sura]] is laughing, talking to the [[Orcs|orc]], seemingly asking her questions. There is wine and rich food, and several other court attendants and ladies of the court. Someone stands up, perhaps to recite poetry, and the tent goes quiet, watching. [[Sura]] and the [[Orcs|orc]] whisper to each other for a moment, and then get up to leave the tent. The [[Orcs|orc]] folds you up and puts you in a pouch, and the scene fades to black.Â
