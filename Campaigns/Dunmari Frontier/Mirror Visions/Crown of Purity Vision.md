- Through the mirror, the party witnesses the crown’s creation in the days of myth, where it formed as a remnant of the gods’ separation from the mortal plane.

- The crown’s legacy spans eons, showing both its role in empowering good and its use in acts of tyranny, including Apollyon’s rise and its earlier use in saving an island nation from annihilation.

- The crown’s power is revealed to adapt to its wielder’s intentions, making it both a tool of salvation and destruction.

Tim Sackton: So Kenzo holds the crown up to the mirror.
Tim Sackton: Yeah, common. It's strange. When you pick it up, it seems to recoil from your touch. You feel like a sort of sparkling, almost a magnetic repulsion as you try and hold on. It seems once you have lost it, it is. And you look in the mirror, and it shows you the first thing you see is a study. It looks maybe, Chardon sometime ago, maybe a hundred years. It's hard to say.

Mike Sackton: This is probably Fausto finding it.
Eric Rosenbaum: Right.

Tim Sackton: Maybe a hundred fifty years, and you see and it seems what the crown itself looks not like. It looks now the risen crown, nor like the Fausto crown. It is a plain, like wooden band. No decoration, nothing. You're in a study, and somebody looks like they are, you know, doing research, cataloging things. There is on their desk what seems to be the beginnings of a treatise on the historical greatness of Drankor. How can how to bring back the might of empire? Somebody seems obsessed. You see notes scattered across the page. Like Apollyon, like scepter, lost cloak, lost. Could this be the crown? And then you see hands gripping it, and time seems to speed up slightly as first, there's this electric shock, and the person who was holding it seems to fall dead. And somebody else walks in, somebody older, seeming to be like the master, the leader of whatever this group is smiling as he reaches and grabs the crown, and it shifts and elongates the four points of Fausto's crown, beginning to form.

Mike Sackton: But this person's not Fausto. We can't.

Tim Sackton: Not Festor. They were old when they picked up the crown, so they must have passed on. Whoever this was, was the person who founded the club. And then the scene shifts, time reversing, going backwards, the plain wooden band sitting dusty in a forgotten chest, not even radiating magic, lost going back and back, part of a caravan traveling across Dunmar in a chest tossed carelessly, now not wooden, but an iron band tossed with dozens of other meaningless Drankorian artifacts. Are there iron bands going back, further and further, buried underground? And then you see Apollyon standing in life, standing in front of the doors to this temple, wearing the crown, holding out the scepter as bands of magic fly from him towards Cha'mutte, flying in the sky above him. And as Cha'mutte breathes and rends, the red mist piles around Apollyon. Strand after strand, hundreds of strands break, thousands of strands break. It must be 5, 6, 7, 8,000 people in command of Apollyon through this crown die and die and die until finally none are left. And Apollyon screams in frustration and in desperation grabs a vial of black liquid from his pouch and drinks it as the walls of his temple seal up around him, and the crown is tossed from his head across Drankor skipping, and time jumps suddenly back a long time back. You don't ever see how Apollyon found it back to Hkar. The great war, people terrified, a giant armada bearing down on the island. Nobody's sure what to do. The crown sitting again, now a plain iron band on a marble table in a temple. Some discussion around, murmured low voices in a language you do not understand. You can't hear anything anyway. And then nodding, and one of the men and women gathered here reaches for the crown and grabs it and puts it on their head. And lines of power shoot out, and again time sort of speeds up and reverses. And you see the crown reaching out with these 12 people together, and the island breaks apart and begins to walk.

Tim Sackton: And then flying back even further, drifting far, far, far back into time, before humans even existed. Back to that, the forests of the elves, back to when the gods strode through the world, the days of myth. When the footsteps of the gods reshaped the world itself, the plane of magic intertwined, the plane of souls intertwined with the world itself, and then a shattering, the moment when the gods pulled the world apart, and something was caught when the world was pulled apart and curled itself into a circlet and fell into the forest. A fragment of the ancient days when the world could be reshaped, frozen in material form, mindless but powerful, waiting, a chameleon always to adapt to whoever puts it on. And the mirror goes black.
Mike Sackton: Okay.
