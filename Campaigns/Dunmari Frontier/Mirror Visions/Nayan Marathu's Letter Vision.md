Mike Sackton: Oh, that one! Yeah, the plus wait. The word wisdom is several places, so
Kate Sackton: only 16.
UU Church of Boulder: Inspiration. Oh, that's fine!
Tim Sackton: So the mirror goes blank. and then you see
Tim Sackton: the image looking up
Tim Sackton: in a Gotas hot piece of paper is rolled out on a desk.
Tim Sackton: There is, and you see Agatha standing there.
Mike Sackton: and she goes into her pouch and she takes out a hand the
Tim Sackton: foured hand. It's wearing a ring.
Tim Sackton: and she takes out some wood, and she begins to shape slowly, like a bit of an arm. and then she muttered some words, and the hand begins to crawl towards the paper, and it picks up a pen, and as she speaks it starts writing.
Tim Sackton: and the words that she is speaking, which
Tim Sackton: wellbe can lip read. She's speaking in Dunmari, and the words are exactly the words
Tim Sackton: of the letter. While she speaks them
Tim Sackton: handwrites. The hand picks up and begins to roll
Tim Sackton: the scroll up, and it takes its ring, and it presses it against the scroll to make a seal.
Tim Sackton: and then she picks up. I got to picks up the would in peace tosses that.
Tim Sackton: And you can see
Tim Sackton: Carnot's watching this
Tim Sackton: like this goes on for like 5Â min, roughly, as the hand, is writing out this letter that I got who is speaking.
Tim Sackton: Cardos is watching it.
Tim Sackton: When he first sees Agata in the hut he draws his sword.
Tim Sackton: and that is, it begins to write. He takes his sword, and he like.
Mike Sackton: I will not let him.
Mike Sackton: though I'll like, get in the way. I'll knock it down whatever.
Tim Sackton: We're all like fucking fifteenth level like I'm gonna make sure he doesn't like hit the mirror with his sword. Oh, no, Kenzo Kenzo can. As long as he doesn't do more than 18 damage, Kenza can deflect it automatically. Nice.
Tim Sackton: which is impossible because the maximum you can roll with 0 plus is an 8. So, Kenzo, that's the sort out of the way as the image finishes
Tim Sackton: and he turns and he looks at. He looks at everybody, and he's just like
Tim Sackton: you've never like, because
Tim Sackton: just rage is just like filling himself. And he just yells at you all, get out!
Eric Rosenbaum: Yeah, we can. We can come back.
Tim Sackton: and
Tim Sackton: as yowls  bye, bye, though
Tim Sackton: the mist die kind of and she was. She was watching, too, right. She saw everything she was watching, too. She motions, and she like walks towards him. And you hear saying.
