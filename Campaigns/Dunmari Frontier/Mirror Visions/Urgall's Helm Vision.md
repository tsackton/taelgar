**Vision of Urgall's Helm in the Mirror of Souling Trapping**

You hold the helm up to the mirror, and the scene fades for a moment. 

You see a man standing on the bow of the [[Flaming Tempest]], presumably [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]], wearing the helm. He is holding a trader -- probably a Tollender -- in the air. The Tollender is begging, asking [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] to save his life, but [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] does not seem to care, and slashes in throat. A strange dark mist creeps out of the slit throat, seeming to seep into [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]]'s helm. The scene continues as [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] threatens and interrogates another sailor, the navigator, who also begs for his life, promising to tell [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] where something, or somewhere, is -- you cannot quite see what place he sketches directions to. Then his throat is slit as well.

The scene shifts, and you see [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] standing on the deck of ship, caught in an act of twisted devotion, as he casts a spell to control the waters, causing the ship to turn, and sail straight into the wind, propelled by the spell, as it approaches [[Vetta]]. 

The scene shifts, and you see the one-sided battle for [[Vetta]], the slaughter of the pilgrims and priests of the island, as [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] and his crew descend, fireballs shooting from [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]]'s hands as he shouts spells into the dark night. 

Finally, you see [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]], standing in the temple of [[Vetta]], slitting the throats of ten of his crew. As each dies, the sacred waters of the temple of [[Vetta]] begin to boil and churn, and suddenly you see a tentacle emerging from the sacred waters in the distance, and black acid begin to seep over everything. This, clearly, is a scene of ritual sacrifice, where [[Urgall the Black|Urgall]] is slaughtering his own crew to summon a demon, Mashtu the Corruptor or some servant of his. 

The scene fades.
