# Soul Lantern Vision

The mirror fades to black, and then clears, showing the inside of [[Agata]]’s hut. Kneeling on the ground are two [[Orcs]], bruised and battered and stripped to rags. [[Agata]] is speaking, probably yelling, at them, and then [[Samerki]] steps in, his giant spiked club over his shoulder, and swings and bashes their heads in. As the [[Orcs]] die, [[Agata]] chants briefly.

The scene flickers, and a new scene appears. The scene is the same -- [[Agata's Lair]] -- but this time, there is a human standing in front of [[Agata]], hands tied. [[Agata]] is berating him, and then reaches to her belt, draws a knife, and slits his throat. Again, [[Agata]] chants and makes a symbol with her hands. 

The scene continues to flicker and flash, showing over and over again people being slaughtered in [[Agata's Lair]], and [[Agata]] claiming their souls. Most are [[Orcs]], although you see a handful of humans. 

The scenes of death in [[Agata]]’s hut are interrupted only once, by a different scene: a halfling caravan, on the road, scouts ahead and wagons guarded by archers. You, as the lantern, see this scene from the back of a giant fly as [[Agata]] descends. This is [[Garret Tealeaf]]’s family, and as the scene shifts back to [[Agata]]’s hut you can see in the mirror an undead spirit growing out of the mirror and swooping down to chase the halflings, who scatter in terror. [[Oswalt Tealeaf]], who we met on the boat to [[Chardon]], and is [[Garret Tealeaf]]’s cousin, corroborates this story.
