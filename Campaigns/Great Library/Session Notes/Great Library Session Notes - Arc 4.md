## Adventure 17: What do you mean, we have to kill a dragon?!?
### Session 52

After regrouping, the party heads upriver and discovers a small bullywug village, that appears to have been stealing the Chardonian cattle. The party attacks and nearly wipes out the entire village before realizing that perhaps they should have talked first. After some limited communication with drawings and diagrams – and the threat of a giant froghemoth potentially attacking them – they realize the bullywugs were driven from their home by a dragon. The bullywugs communicate that if the dragon is killed, all will be forgiven.

### Session 53

The party returns to the Chardonian fort and leaves the problem of the nearly-exterminated bullwugs in the commander’s hands, and heads north to track the dragon. Along the way, after about a week’s journey upriver, they meet some Northerners, who are gathered at a council to discuss what to do about the very same dragon. 

After some discussion with the Northerner council, the party decides to travel with Izkir, a priest of Bita, a bear spirit, who will lead them to the lair. After almost 10 days, they come to the edge of the Blackwater Fens, where the dragon lair is.

### Session 54

The party sets off into the Blackwater Fens, with Adrick leading the way and Samso keeping an eye out for danger. They pass an ancient stone marker, about 60’ high, marking friendship between the elves and the humans, but it has fallen on its side. Continuing into the swamp, they make camp for the night.

In the middle of the night, the dragon, scouting its territory, finds them, and surprises the camp with a blast of its acid breath. While perched on a tree and taunting them, demanding they join its service or die, Adrik and Aelar manage to get on top of it, and are hasted by Izkir’s magic. As they beat on the dragon from above – and an attempted polymorph of Aelar into a T-rex is less successful than hope – the dragon takes to the air, watching the spellcasters and attempting to disruption their concentration. Still, Adrik and Aelar do considerable damage before Samso’s conjured air elemental turns against the party as he falls unconscious, and the dragon flees, wounded.

Rather than attempt to rest here, where the dragon is alerted to their presence, the party hikes overnight to the stone monument, and spends the day repairing it using the plan suggested by the Dwarven gods, at Brelith’s questioning with the Divination spell. With the monument restored, the party finally rests safely. 

The next day is spent scrying and scouting, trying to assess the situation before heading for the lair to attack and kill the dragon. 

### Session 55

The party makes a plan and finally confronts Nymthrax in his lair. The battle is fiercely fought, and the party is nearly killed by the searing acid of his breath. However, in the dragon’s moment of triumph, with everyone but Brelith unconscious on the battlefield, Brelith summons lightning to strike down the dragon. 

The party then loots his hoard, finding a vast collection of art, gems, coin, and treasure from throughout history. 

### Session 56

The party spends a considerable amount of time organizing treasure and figuring out how to transport the entire hoard. With that accomplished, they head south, saying goodbye to Izkir, and then meeting again with the bullywugs to tell them their home is safe and return some treasure the dragon stole from them. 

A few weeks later, they arrive back in Voltara, greeting by Julius their steward.

## Adventure 18: What’s at the Bottom of that Vast, Dark Chasm?
### Session 57

The party spends some time in Voltara. They sell treasure, decorate their manor, and purchase an extradimensional vault from an eccentric dwarven artificer. They also receive letters: 
- from Dinia, saying that Arion’s tower is gone; 
- from Iara, the lizardfolk, saying her people are heading south to Lake Valandros; 
- from Archivist Lyra, saying that the elemental scrolls were well-received, that should they find any more of Arion’s treasure they should come to Chardon to sell it, and also asking if they would look into the disappearance of another group of adventurers in the Goldpeak Mines. 

With their treasure protected by magic and with Julius paid and the manor restocked, the party heads out to Goldpeak Mines, where they find a mysterious abandoned camp with dead bodies.

### Session 58

Hearing noises from the tent at the abandoned camp, Samso lights the fabric on fire, which is encouraged to spread by Adrik’s ability to control flames. As the fire burns, a dwarf emerges but quickly dissolves into a pair of gibbering mouthers. The party fights them, and the tentacled rats that emerge from the dead bodies of a pair of horses. Despite Adrik’s mind being frequently overcome by the gibbering whispers calling out to Vilaxes, the party defeats these creatures and heads into the mines. Easily descending the cliff walls, the party finds a ruined ladder of massive, thick braided rope at the bottom. Charging ahead into a rough-hewn passage, Adrik is attacked and ambushed by a Cloaker, which summons two carrion crawlers to aid it. Despite its annoying grapple, the cloaker is driven off, and the carrion crawlers are killed by Aelar as they try to flee. 

### Session 59

The Silver Tempests continue down the passage, finding a campfire with the surviving Chardonians: Alton, the halfling rogue from long ago, and Cassia, a human paladin. They claim that some weird aberrations are living in the depths; their companion, a dwarf, was corrupted and went mad. After a rest, the party joins Cassia and Alton to explore further. 

After traveling some distance into the depths, the party finds some guards, twisted tentacled horrors watching the passageway. Between Samso’s wall of thorns and Brelith’s shatter spell, combined with the usual strength of the melee fighters, the guards die quickly. But it does not matter that the guards do not sound the alarm, as shatter alerts the base anyway. 

Entering the lair, Brelith falls into a quicksand trap and needs most of the rest of the party to rescue him; Aelar is left free to run up the wall and chase down some kobolds who are watching. One of the kobolds is pretending to be an acolyte of the fire god, and speaks freely to the party when he realizes they were the instigators of that con. From him, they learn that a beholder has taken over the kobold den, driving them to make a massive statue to his glory. 

Sneaking through the lair, the party encounters a few guards, attempting to trick them into believing they are here to worship [[Vilaxes]], the beholder. This fails, and Adrick, Brelith, Cassia, and Samso are quickly chained and tossed into pits. Aelar and Alton, hidden, follow, and then launch an attack on the guards. A fight ensues, during which everyone escapes from their pits. 

The party confronts the beholder Vilaxes in a massive cavern dominated by a huge statue of a beholder walking on two legs, made of precious metals, random dungeon detritus, and broken weapons and armor. The fight seems to be going badly, with Aelar and Alton charmed, and Adrik and Cassia about to succumb to petrification, when Adrik uses a wish to remove all status effects from the party. Hoping to keep the beholder’s attention in his earth elemental form, Samso begins attacking the statue, cracking it in half, and drawing the beholder’s rage. While Samso is the focus of every blast of magic, and eventually succumbs to the death ray, Adrick strikes down Vilaxes with Thunderbrand. Brelith is then able to quickly cast revivify, bringing Samso back from the dead, and later restore Cassia as well. 

### Session 60

Back in Voltara, the Silver Tempest enjoys the rewards of their status and reputation. Brelith apprentices himself to the chef at Finoc Small’s tavern, the Wandering Toad, learning to cook, and opening a restaurant, Cleric Cooks. Adrik goes on a binge of pit fighting and gambling, managing to end up with a small profit. Samso travels to visit with Iara at the lizardfolk community near Lake Valandros, and learns more about the mysterious attacks. Alton opens a boisterous tavern and dive bar outside the city walls, called the Rogue’s Range, with axe throwing for patrons. 

Four months later, the Silver Tempest hosts a party, a grand opening for Cleric Cooks. Many old friends are there, thanks to Samso’s new magic ability to teleport via plants: Dinia, from the north; Brelith’s parents and some other dwarves of Zarkandur; and Aris and some other centaurs, who are leaving on the next stop in their migration and have come to say goodbye. It is a big success.
