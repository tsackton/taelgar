# Chronicles of the Quest for Answers to Extraplanar Mysteries  

After months of waiting, clues to the mysterious disappearance of [[Urkabi]], [[Samso]]'s village, arrive with a new traveler, [[Blue]]. The [[Silver Tempests]] set off to the south to investigate, traveling to the city of [[Castrella]], and then into the mountains on a hunt for [[Yeshara]], the wolf-eyed queen of a shadowy realm called [[Cairn Dor]]. Fighting through shadowy enemies, the [[Silver Tempests]] find a portal to [[Cairn Dor]] called the [[Cleaver-Stone]], as well as a series of stone plinths that form a soul compass, facilitating the theft of mortals from the [[Material Plane]] to serve as dreamers for the [[Shemra Azem]], the sleepless, every-vigilant army of [[Cairn Dor]]. With the aid of clues found in the old Drankorian fortress guarding this place, the [[Silver Tempests]] shut down the portal and the soul compass, but retreat to [[Castrella]] to regroup before venturing into [[Cairn Dor]] itself. 

## Adventure 20: The Mysterious Sigil

### Session 62

A few weeks after returning from rescuing [[Dinia]] from the [[Havoc Host]], [[Samso]] is still waiting for a response to his inquiry regarding the mysterious sigil associated with [[Urkabi|his village's]] disappearance and the [[Umbral Covenant]], sent to Archivist [[Lyra]] in [[Chardon]]. The city guards bring [[Blue]], human with blue skin and strange eyes, who claims to be carrying a message for [[Samso]], to the [[Tempest Towers]]. Blue turns over [[Letter from Chardon for Samso on the Umbral Covenant|the letter]], which she has opened and read, and mentions she is also interested in tracking down the Umbral Covenant. After reading and discussing, the party uses [[Samso]]'s Transport via Plants to go back to his hometown -- still abandoned -- and make their way to the city of [[Castrella]], where [[Lyra]] has suggested that folk tales and legends might provide more clues than official scholarly works. 

From [[Urkabi]], the [[Silver Tempests]] travel down the [[Zurrua]] river, on [[Samso]]'s boat summoned by the [[Staff of the Swamplands]], finding a place to camp for the night as best they can. The next morning, with Samso's spells restored, they turn to wind and travel to [[Castrella]], where the party splits up. [[Adrik]], emerging on the docks, wanders through taverns spreading money around. At [[Sober Seal]], he hears about [[Isabetta]], a popular singer at the [[The Drunken Dolphin]], who might have interesting folk legends to tell. [[Blue]] hids in an alley, and accidentally mugs a drunk sailor. [[Mabist]], transformed into Marigold, an old woman, finds two kids, [[Camile]] and [[Arturo]], who have fled trouble upriver, and helps find them jobs at [[The Whale's Spout]], where the owner, [[Old Leo]], has made a habit of taking in orphans. [[Samso]] finds a library, but ends up annoying [[Niccolo]], the librarian, and stealing books in wild shape. 

Regrouping at [[The Laughing Gull]] for the evening, the party discusses what they learned. Adrik picked up numerous legends of [[Yeshara]], also called the wolf queen or the wolf-eyed queen, who seemed to have lived in this area many, many years ago along with her people. The stories say that [[Yeshara]] was afraid of the dark, and used some kind of magic to create an eternally vigilant, sleepless army, called the [[Shemra Azem]]. According to folk tales, [[Yeshara]] and the [[Shemra Azem]] were behind many of the wars in this region, including the [[War of the Dark Rift]], the [[War of the Severed Dreams]], and [[~First Shadow War~]] dating all the way back to the [[Drankorian Era]]. These folk tales speak of a Drankorian fortress that imprisoned [[Yeshara]]. The official histories, however, disagree, considering the [[Umbral Covenant]], the antagonists in the [[War of the Dark Rift]], to be different from the enemies in previous wars. From [[Mabist]], the party learns that a sleeping sickness is killing people, still, in villages in the [[Kedron]] valley, and some villages mysteriously vanish. 

The next morning, after talking some more with [[Old Leo]], the party decides to travel upriver and investigate the rumored [[~Drankorian Cleaver-Stone Fort~|Drankorian fort]]. With wind walk, the journey is quick, and the party camps in a ravine about five miles from the entrance to the fort to rest before the assault.

### Events

- (DR:: 1748-09-17): [[Blue]] arrives in Voltara with a [[Letter from Chardon for Samso on the Umbral Covenant|letter]] for [[Samso]] about the [[Umbral Covenant]]. The [[Silver Tempests]], with [[Blue]], transport via plants to [[Urkabi]], [[Samso]]'s village, and head downriver on Samso's magic raft. Camp along the [[Zurrua]]. 
- (DR:: 1748-09-18): Samso turns the [[Silver Tempests]] to mist and the party wind walks to [[Castrella]], arriving around noon. The group splits up to investigate and gather information, regrouping at [[The Laughing Gull]] that evening to discuss. 
- (DR:: 1748-09-19): The [[Silver Tempests]] speak to a group of orphans at [[The Whale's Spout]], then wind walk up the [[Kedron]] into the interior. Pass a [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorian]] mile stone pointing towards the [[Cairn Dor]] guard post. Reach a ravine with a fort, and camp for the evening.
- (DR:: 1748-09-20): Enter the fort, fighting off shadow guardians. Explore Drankorian ruins beyond and find an archive with information about locking the portal to [[Cairn Dor]]. Continue deeper into the ravine, passing a door with the seal of [[Yeshara|the wolf-eyed queen]], which curses the party preventing sleep. Defeat two warriors of the [[Shemra Azem]] in a longhouse beyond. Find the standing stones of the soul compass (forming a light in the shape of the sigil that [[Samso]] has seen) and the [[Cleaver-Stone]], which appears to be a portal to somewhere, beyond. Fight [[Yeshara]]'s lieutenant and more [[Shemra Azem]] and nearly die. [[Mabist]] is knocked unconscious and dragged through the portal; [[Adrik]] runs through to rescue them, while [[Samso]], in earth elemental form, slays the lieutenant. Use the instructions from the Drankorian archive to lock the portal, seemingly stopping the ongoing incursion. Leave to regroup before entering [[Cairn Dor]] to try to find [[Samso]]'s village.
