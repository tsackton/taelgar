## Adventure 19: Saving Grandma Yoda (This Shit’s Kinda’ Fishy)

### Session 61

Mabist comes knocking on the door of the Tempest Towers. Both Samso and Adrik are a bit suspicious of this armored visitor before we learn Dinia was captured. We retrieve Alton from his violent dive bar. In misty forms the party flies to Suwi, a distant village near the coast, where they meet the village priest, and ask about rumors of the Havoc Host, a mercenary group that was involved in kidnapping Dinia. The priest introduces the party to Clara, a teenaged girl whose brother was kidnapped a few days ago by the Havoc Host, just upriver near a small lake.

The next morning the party travels upriver to the lake. Finding the logging camp where Clara’s brother was taken, they follow a trail along the lakeshore, coming to a rocky clearing where the ruins of a castle overlook the lake. The party manages to ambush a group of slimy minions, and quickly dispatch them, knocking them out and binding them. 

Searching the ruins, Samso finds a concealed tunnel leading underground. Following the tunnel, the party emerges into the barracks of the Havoc Host. Mabist is disguised as a slimy minion; Samso turns into an earth elemental; and Adrik busts down the door. A battle ensues, in which the Havoc Host are soundly beaten. Convinced that Mabist is one of the Ithu’rax’s servants, the mercenaries are reluctant to surrender, until Mabist attempts to surrender himself, convincing them that something strange is going on. At this point, the mercenaries surrender, and are disarmed and convinced to make a better life for themselves opening a franchise of Brelith’s restaurant by Adrik and Mabist. 

The party learns the layout of the tunnels from the mercenaries, and begins to explore, carefully navigating around cracking parts of the tunnels that drop rocks on their heads with a misstep. After navigating through the tunnels for some time, Samso hears sobbing from a room to the south. Here, the party discovers the dead body of an adventurer, and the ghost of Milo Kentbrush, who was sure he could kill the aboleth, but was ambused by the annoying slime servants. The party finds his arrow of aberration slaying, and takes it with them. Milo follows, tied to the arrow.

The party manages to quietly navigate the flooded caverns, emerging into the aboleth’s lair, where they see a psychically controlled Dinia waiting for them. She attacks, and Ithu’rax the aboleth emerges from a central pool, joining the battle. The battle is a challenge. Ithu’rax manipulates his foes physical form, turning ligaments to jelly and lungs to gills, all of which make it difficult for the party to land a blow. Alton, although set up with the arrow of aboleth slaying, misses his shot; Mabist manages to grapple the aboleth with a giant force hand, but is targeted by the aboleth’s anger and eventually knocked unconscious and dropped into the cursed waters at the center of the cave. Samso spends the combat as an earth elemental; while he does not sustain much damage, he is also repeatedly driven back and unable to land a solid blow. It is only Samso’s conjured dragon, and Adrik’s seemingly endless ability to absorb the strikes of the aboleth’s tentacles, that save the party and lead to victory. 

With the aboleth killed, Dinia returns to herself, and appoints herself the caretaker of the now slowly recovering slime servants.

## Adventure 20: The Mysterious Sigil

### Session 62

A few weeks after returning from rescuing Dinia from the Havoc Host, Samso is still waiting for a response to his inquiry regarding the mysterious sigil associated with his village's disappearance and the Umbral Covenant, sent to Archivist Lyra in Chardon. The city guards bring Blue, human with blue skin and strange eyes, who claims to be carrying a message for Samso, to the Tempest Towers. Blue turns over [[Letter from Chardon for Samso on the Umbral Covenant|the letter]], which she has opened and read, and mentions she is also interested in tracking down the Umbral Covenant. After reading and discussing, the party uses Samso's Transport via Plants to go back to his hometown -- still abandoned -- and make their way to the city of [[Castrella]], where Lyra has suggested that folk tales and legends might provide more clues than official scholarly works.
