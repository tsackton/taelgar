# The Chronicles of the Silver Tempests

Herein lies the chronicles of the [[Silver Tempests]], from their humble roots as hired adventurers for the [[Great Library]], to their current fame.

## The Elemental Scrolls

The first major adventure of the [[Silver Tempests]], before they acquired their wealth and fame, was in service of the [[Great Library]], hired by Archivist [[Lyra]] to recover the [[Elemental Scrolls of Airion|lost elemental scrolls]], that had been created by a famous wizard, [[Airion|Airion Mistspeaker]], before the [[Great War]], but lost during the chaos of the [[Blood Years]]. They eventually recovered all four scrolls for [[Lyra]], and built a name for themselves. Along the way, they helped some [[centaurs]] with a curse; helped the soul of [[Xameia]] of the [[Order of Twilight]] find peace; helped [[Iara]], a lizardfolk woman; and made enemies of the [[Orcs|orcs]] of [[Grumella's Horde]]. 

This full story is told in the [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 1|Chronicles of the Quest for the Elemental Scrolls]].

## The War Against Grumella

With the successful recovery of all four of the [[Elemental Scrolls of Airion]], the party enjoyed the status and wealth that comes from success and a growing reputation. Unfortunately, along the way, they made enemies, most notably [[Grumella]], an orc warlord with an eye to conquest. Faced with an ultimatum to surrender or be destroyed, the party turned their eyes to the defense of [[Voltara]], recruiting allies far and wide. This endeavor culminated in the [[Battle of Voltara]], during which [[Grumella]] was defeated. The party was celebrated as heroes of the city in victory.
