# The Chronicles of the Silver Tempests

Herein lies the chronicles of the [[Silver Tempests]], from their humble roots as hired adventurers for the [[Great Library]], to their current fame.

## The Elemental Scrolls
*The Silver Tempests get their start as hired hands for the Great Library.*

The first major adventure of the [[Silver Tempests]], before they acquired their wealth and fame, was in service of the [[Great Library]], hired by Archivist [[Lyra]] to recover the [[Elemental Scrolls of Airion|lost elemental scrolls]], that had been created by a famous wizard, [[Airion|Airion Mistspeaker]], before the [[Great War]], but lost during the chaos of the [[Blood Years]]. They eventually recovered all four scrolls for [[Lyra]], and built a name for themselves. Along the way, they helped some [[centaurs]] with a curse; helped the soul of [[Xameia]] of the [[Order of Twilight]] find peace; helped [[Iara]], a lizardfolk woman; and made enemies of the [[Orcs|orcs]] of [[Grumella's Horde]]. 

This full story is told in the [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 1|Chronicles of the Quest for the Elemental Scrolls]].

## The War Against Grumella
*The Silver Tempests prove crucial to the defeat of Grumella's orc horde and establish themselves as the heroes of Voltara.*

With the recovery of all four of the [[Elemental Scrolls of Airion]], the party enjoyed the status and wealth that comes from success and a growing reputation. Unfortunately, along the way, they made enemies, most notably [[Grumella]], an orc warlord with an eye to conquest. Faced with an ultimatum to surrender or be destroyed, the party turned their eyes to the defense of [[Voltara]], recruiting allies far and wide. This endeavor culminated in the [[Battle of Voltara]], during which [[Grumella]] was defeated. The party was celebrated as heroes of the city in victory.

##  The Cursed Cold
*The Silver Tempests venture forth and make a name for themselves among the dwarves of Zarkandur.*

Celebrated as heroes in [[Voltara]] after providing [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 2|crucial contributions to the defense of the city]] against [[Grumella's Horde]], the party basks in their new-found fame, enjoying the manor they are gifted by the [[~Proconsul of Voltara~]] in thanks for their aid. Once the [[Chardonian Legion|legions]] arrive from the south to reinforce the city, though, the party turns to their next challenge: worries from [[Brelith]]'s parents back home in [[Zarkandur]] about dwarven cities succumbing to a cursed cold. The party makes their first long journey, east to the dwarven kingdom of [[Am'khazar]], passing dangers and meeting the [[Deno'qai]] of [[Raha]] along the way. In the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] above [[Am'khazar]], they discover a [[Morgana Stoneclaw|hag]], along with her frost giant allies, is behind the spreading cold. The party defeats the hag, realizing she is the very same one who traumatized [[Adrik]] as a child, and returns to [[Zarkandur]] as heroes.

## The Silver Tempests Ascendant
*The Silver Tempests grow into a powerful force to be reckoned with, defeating a dragon, a beholder, and an aboleth.*

Fresh off their victory over the hag [[Morgana Stoneclaw]], the party, now calling themselves the [[Silver Tempests]], finds themselves facing some of the more terrible monsters of the land. While returning to [[Voltara]], they learn a black [[Dragons|dragon]] is disrupting the [[northern frontier]], causing conflict between the [[~Voltara East Border Fort~]] and a local [[Bullywugs|bullywug]] population. Proving their growing power, the [[Silver Tempests]] kill the dragon, [[Nymthrax]], and loot the riches of its lair. Returning to [[Voltara]], they leave to explore the ruins far beneath [[Goldpeak Mountain]], (re)uniting with some Chardonian explorers and finding the lair of a beholder, [[Vilaxes]]. Defeating the beholder, the [[Silver Tempests]] return to [[Voltara]], extremely wealthy and in need a long break, during which [[Brelith]] opens a restaurant and retires. Their break is interrupted, however, by the arrival of [[Mabist]] with the news that [[Dinia]] has been captured by the [[Havoc Host]]. The [[Silver Tempests]] ride forth in anger, freeing [[Dinia]] from the control of an aboleth, [[Ithuâ€™rax]], near the village of [[Suwi]].

## Extraplanar Mysteries
*The Silver Tempests turn their sights beyond the Material Plane*

After months of waiting, clues to the mysterious disappearance of [[Urkabi]], [[Samso]]'s village, arrive with a new traveler, [[Blue]]. The [[Silver Tempests]] set off to the south to investigate, traveling to the city of [[Castrella]], and then into the mountains on a hunt for [[Yeshara]], the wolf-eyed queen of a shadowy realm called [[Cairn Dor]]. Fighting through shadowy enemies, the [[Silver Tempests]] find a portal to [[Cairn Dor]] called the [[Cleaver-Stone]], as well as a series of stone plinths that form a soul compass, facilitating the theft of mortals from the [[Material Plane]] to serve as dreamers for the [[Shemra Azem]], the sleepless, every-vigilant army of [[Cairn Dor]]. With the aid of clues found in the old Drankorian fortress guarding this place, the [[Silver Tempests]] shut down the portal and the soul compass, but retreat to [[Castrella]] to regroup before venturing into [[Cairn Dor]] itself.
