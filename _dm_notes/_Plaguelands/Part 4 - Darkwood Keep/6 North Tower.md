**Generic tower description:**
 
*short flight of stone steps leading to entryway (wooden door)  
*arrow loops on all floors  
*battlements and defensive structures on top floor, along with ballista  
*on top floor, wooden door to battlements on each side + ladder to roof  
*two floors (1st/2nd, no ground by default)
 
**North Tower (Prison Tower):**
 
On the 1st floor, there is a trap door in the floor to dungeon below. Can hear weak groans from below, DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine, Investigation) to realize they are not sounds humans would make.
 
Otherwise, first floor is a guard house and storage room. Again, any equipment for war has been cleared out quickly, DC 15 Int (Investigation) check reveals info about rapid departure, weapons taken, etc -- if they have found other signs before, DC 10 (but beating DC 15 gives more info).
 
2nd floor is guard room, with trap door and ladder to roof.
 
**Dungeon**:
 
Pitch black, three cells (one big, two smaller). Cell doors are broken open, chains shattered and lying around. Smells terrible. In the cells are two **relentless rotting zombies** (one with max HP), and two **rotting zombies**. No treasure.
 
(all dead and burned)
