**Approach**
 
_As you approach the outer gate house and the bridge, you can see the form of the castle more clearly. The central keep and stronghold is protected by two walls - a short (15' high) outer wall in front of a much taller (40' high) inner wall. Both walls have round towers overlooking the approaches._
 
_In front of you stands a pair of small square towers forming a gate house, with an iron portcullis blocking the way. Just beyond the gate house, a deep ravine looms - the bridge behind the towers seems to be the only way across._
 
A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals there is no sign of a struggle or forced entry at the gate. The doors to the guard houses are closed, but not locked and can be opened without difficulty.
 
Inside the left guard house is a winch for raising the portcullis. One person can turn it alone with a successful DC 10 Strength check; two people working together do not need a check.
 
Portcullis is not silent going up, but not super-loud either. Does not trigger any chance of detection unless party is generally making a lot of noise.
 
Looking for tracks, signs of travel, or similar will reveal horse hoofprints automatically. On a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival, Perception) check will see slight disturbances leading away from the road, along the ravine - an old trail of one or a few people running. Following trail along edge of ravine will reveal four bodies dead in the ravine below, mostly hidden by rubble and debris. They are shot through with black arrows.
 
Climbing down ravine (60' deep) requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. On failure, fall 10' per point of failure, up to max of 60', taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10'. If they tie a rope to top and use it to climb down, no check needed -- can drop 10 feet with a DC 10 Dex (Acrobatics) to avoid 1d6 damage and falling prone.
 
The bodies have Addermarch livery, and have been dead at least a week. No treasure, unless they want to carry chain mail around but it is very heavy.
 
**Bridge**
 
_The bridge beyond the portcullis is a very narrow, but sturdily constructed stone arch spanning the ravine._
 
There are no traps or dangers on the bridge itself, but they will be passing into the "zone" of the main boss. When they reach the half way point of the bridge, describe: "_You travel slowly across the bridge, keeping your eyes peeled for danger or anything out of the ordinary. As you step across the halfway point, the light seems to dim in the sky, as if a thin black curtain were drawn across it._
 
_After a moment the feeling fades, but as you continue to the other side of the bridge, you cannot shake a nagging sense that something is not right._
 
While crossing the bridge, a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal the dead bodies, if they were not already found.
 
Detect Magic does not reveal any magical objects, but if Maglor uses Detect Magic, he sees "_A thin dark purple veil drawn across the sky, slowly pulsing. With each pulse you see brief flashes of energy radiating from somewhere ahead. You can also sense that several ley lines - lines of magical energy - converge here, and they are also pulsing with the same energy."_
