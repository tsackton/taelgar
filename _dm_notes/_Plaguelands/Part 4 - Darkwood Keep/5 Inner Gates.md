The gatehouse is a 40' tall, made up of two imposing towers with a passageway passing through. The entrance is protected by a portcullis in front of a thick wooden door. Without a battering ram, there is no way to break this down.
 
Beyond the door is a passageway about 10' wide and 30' long that leads to a second portcullis preventing entry to the courtyard. Arrow slits in the walls, and murder holes in the ceiling, provide defense.
 
**North and South Guardhouse:**
 
The first floor of the gatehouse has the same layout on both sides. Facing the courtyard is a wooden door allowing entry to a storeroom. Nothing of value remains, and there are signs of quickly gathering materials/supplies. A DC 15 Int (Investigation) check reveals info about rapid departure, weapons taken. A spiral staircase leads up, and another door leads to the guard room.
 
Each guard room contains two **skeleton archers.** Will attack creatures in the passageway with 3/4 cover.
