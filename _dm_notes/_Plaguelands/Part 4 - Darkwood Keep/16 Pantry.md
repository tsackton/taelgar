This room is empty. There is salvageable food here, mostly dried meat and hard cheese, along with a few barrels of winter apples. Finding the good food from the bad requires a DC 10 Intelligence check, perhaps adding Survival, Cook's Utensils, or Investigation.
 
With a successful check, they can find 5 rations worth of seemingly edible food.
