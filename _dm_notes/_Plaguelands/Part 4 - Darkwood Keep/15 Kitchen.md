This was once the kitchen for the castle, and a large fireplace, a spit, and a heavy wooden table remain. Obvious signs of battle, and several dead bodies. Smells of rotting meat and putrescence.
 
The four dead bodies are **Cursed Beggar Ghouls**. This should be an easy fight.
 
At some point, the party may notice that all the undead they are fighting seems to be the remains of commoners, not soldiers. If they ask about it, confirm it, and certainly Thardin or Maglor would realize this is unusual.
 
Could also give them a general Intelligence check with DC 10 or 15 to notice.
 
The kitchen has been largely destroyed by battle.
