Darkwood Keep is a major fortification and border defense of Addermarch, and ultimately Sembara. It is a solid castle with a moat, outer walls, and inner keep, designed for defense, and situated on high ground overlooking the pass to the Plaguelands, and the Darkwood.
 
Two weeks ago, the Keep was taken by hobgoblins. A shock force of 40 hobgoblin soldiers and allies (including a hill giant), aided by the Necromancer and several spellcasters, traveling through the Shadowfell to avoid the defenses of the keep. Using magic they quickly captured most of the guards and retainers (~100 guards and ~400 retainers), who were led into the Darkwood.
 
The Necromancer is now embarking on a ritual to sacrifice the prisoners and raise an army of undead.
 
Darkwood Keep is now held by undead, plus a small contingent of hobgoblins guarding the approaches. Undead boss holds sway and was given castle by Necromancer; seeks to grow its undead army, etc.
