This storage area contains disassembled siege weapons (two catapults), and several smashed open crates of weapons. With some searching, 12 arrows and 22 crossbow bolts can be recovered, along with 2 longswords.
 
There is also an abundance of items like rope, cloth, empty sacks, and other mundane items required for the castle to function.
