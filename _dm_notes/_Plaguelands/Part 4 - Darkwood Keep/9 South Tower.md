**South Tower (Artisan's Tower):**
 
The first floor is a leatherworker's / armorer's workshop, connected by a short staircase from the blacksmith/forge.
 
A careful search can reveal two functional sets of leatherworking tools (5 gp, 1 medium item each), and a functional set of smith's tools (25 gp, 1 big item). There are also various partially repaired/assembled pieces of armor. A successful Intelligence (Investigation or Smith's Tools) DC 10 check reveals a functional chain shirt.
 
The second floor is divided into three bedrooms -- one nicer room for the armorer, a smaller room for the smith, and a bunk room for apprentices. There is also a trapdoor leading to roof, and doors leading to exits.
 
The smith's room is mostly empty, although under the bed is a small chest with 24 sp and a nice silvered dagger (75 gp if sold, small item). Findable if they state they are searching under the bed, or with a DC 20 passive Wisdom (Perception), or a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) if actively searching.
 
**Armorer's Room:**
 
_As you enter the room, a rotting stench washes over you. There is a bed against a wall, and a wardrobe standing the corner next to a small table, but the most notable feature is four bodies, throats cut, piled next to the bed._
 
Anyone entering the room must make a DC 12 Con saving throw, or be poisoned for the next minute. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the save to shake off the effect.
 
These are the dead remains of the armorer and three apprentices. As soon as someone comes within 5 feet of any of the bodies, they will rise up as a **cursed ghast** and three **cursed ghouls** and attempt to devour whomever came closest. They are mad with hunger and rage and will act almost rabid.
