As the party enters the chapel:
 
_As you step through the wooden doors, you find yourself in a chapel, seemingly miraculously intact. A wave of warmth washes over you, and you feel a sense of peace permeating the room. There are wooden pews filling a good portion of the space in front of you, simple and well worn. At the far end of the central aisle stands an altar to the Father, and behind it a octagonal stained glass window representing the Eight divines. The altar itself is of white granite, with two large candles burning on it. Kneeling in front of the altar is an emaciated man, in dirty gray robes, praying._
 
The man is **Jaufri**, a priest of the Father (use acolyte stats if needed). He has been stuck in the chapel for nearly two weeks, occasionally sneaking out to get water from the well. He has not eating in 10 days, though, and is very weak.
 
The chapel itself is protected by a _Hallow_ spell, so undead cannot enter and bodies interred here cannot rise as undead. This has kept the priest safe.
 
He is initially suspicious but won't attack; starving and clearly in bad shape in general. Have someone make a persuasion roll if they try to talk to him, if they beat a DC 10 he will be cautiously open, a DC 15 will be friendly and grateful, DC 20 will be completely open.
 
He can tell them the following information:  
-several weeks ago (2, maybe 3) mists settled over the castle, and riders and messengers from Adderfell and other places stopped coming.  
-two weeks ago, he was up late praying to the Father for guidance, when a crash and a cry of alarm alerted him to trouble; peaking out of the doors of the chapel he saw a skeleton warrior with a pike riding a skeletal horse ride through a black, misty gate in the courtyard, followed by several skeletons, a few hobgoblins, and then a swirling humanoid form of darkness and shadow. Ashamed to say at that point I fled, praying to the Father for our salvation.  
-the sounds of combat were brief, and the castle soon quieted; ventured out briefly but several corpses stood up, lurching towards me and I had to run for safety  
-seems that everyone is gone; where, I do not know. I have been praying for guidance for many days and can only guess that the Father sent you to me
 
**Treasure**:
 
Jaufri has two potions of protection from necrotic damage which he will give to party if they are generally friendly. Last 1 hour, half damage from necrotic. Also has 1 scroll of revivify hidden away.
 
**Developments:**
 
This is obviously a safe place to rest; a short or long rest can be taken here without fear of interruption.
