_A large clearing opens before you in the increasingly wooded terrain. About a half mile away, a rocky outcropping rises above the land. Perched on top of it is Darkwood Keep, with a commanding view across the landscape. The keep itself is an imposing castle, with a lower outer shield wall and commanding inner wall, with numerous round towers overlooking the approaches. The road follows a steep path up wide stone stairs to a small gate house and a bridge crossing a ravine, beyond which the main gate stands. Sheer cliffs and steep scree slopes surround the outcropping, making approach from any other direction difficult. The castle itself seems completely intact, and from this distance still and quiet._
 
Let them ask any questions about description, then "what do you do?"
 
They are about 1/2 mile away, so hard to see anything on the walls, but allow a Wisdom (Perception) check if desired. If they beat DC 10, "_You spend a few moments observing the castle. It seems eerily quiet, almost too quiet. You see no guards, no signs of movement."_ If they beat DC 20, "_The outer walls and gates appear to be completely deserted. You watch carefully for any signs of life, guards, or movement, and there is none. Unless someone or something is hiding behind total cover, you are pretty confident that nothing is moving in the outer parts of the castle. The land itself is unnaturally quiet, creating an eerie silence."_
 
If they look for tracks on the road, DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. On success, "_You find recent hoofprints of what seems to be a single horse leaving and returning to the castle. Otherwise, there does not seem to be any sign of tracks since the rainstorms a few days ago."_
 
There is nothing dangerous particularly on the approach, although the road is completely open and even travelling off road the area is just an open field, so stealth is impossible. They can roll to try to move silently, but nothing can prevent them from being seen if there are people to observe them (there aren't on the outer walls or gate house).
 
As they continue up the road:  
_As you continue up the road, the path gets gradually steeper, until you are ascended wide, heavily worn stone steps. As you climb, you feel a chill in the air, and the eerie silence continues. The keep looms ahead of you, silent and still."_
 
A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation, Nature, or Survival) check at this point will indicate the silence is unnatural, should be hearing birds, insects, etc.

[IF MIKE IS PLAYING:
 
They find a ranger sign indicating "danger ahead, proceed with extreme caution", signs of a battle (horse charging, dead body of a ranger scout)
 
But need to think about how a ranger scout would have been detected….
 
Maybe have them not dead?
 
Instead a sign with "news", indicating a message at a drop, message is:
 
"Skeleton archers on the walls; something has gone terribly wrong. Riding north with news."
 
(dated 1 day ago; if they follow road, will see hoofprints coming and going, different horses on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check)
 
(maybe?) (need to think more about how to bring in the Rangers)
