Was once a council chamber or war room, but now the lair of Vadukgul. Dark tendrils and mists hang from ceiling, sense a malevolent energy.
 
Battle is **Vadokgul** with the following lair actions (can do one on initiative count 20):
 
(1) A black tendril strikes at a character, making an attack roll with +6 to hit. On hit, the target has disadvantage on next attack roll.
 
(2) Black ooze bubbles up from floor around one target. DC 13 Strength saving throw or restrained for next round.
 
(3) Cackling laughter in a 15 ft radius - all creatures in radius make DC Wisdom save or take 2d6 psychic damage. (May change this)
