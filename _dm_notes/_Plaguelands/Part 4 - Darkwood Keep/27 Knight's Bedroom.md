This room is the 2nd in command's bedchamber. It is not as damaged as some other areas.
 
_As you open the door you see what is obviously a bedchamber of a well-off knight. The four-poster bed has silk curtains, somewhat in disarray, and the tapestries that line the walls (depicting battle scenes of the Sembaran army) are vividly colored and well-made. There is also a wardrobe with the doors swinging open, and a small chest. Slumped over the bed is a dead body, slightly decomposing. Before you can do anything else, it turns towards you, eyes pinpoints of light, muttering "Death. Death. Please bring me death" under its breadth._
 
This has the stats of a wight, but has no longsword or longbow and instead fights with two shortswords (Multiattack: three attacks; first two are 1d6+2, third is straight 1d6), wears scale mail for an AC of 16, and has 66 hit points.
 
This is the undead remains of the 2nd in command of the castle. It honestly just wants to die and be taken to the chapel where it cannot be raised again, but it is fighting with the compulsion of Vadokgul.
 
Each turn it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist the compulsion to kill. If it succeeds, it will use its action to plead with the party for death, and not attack. If it fails, it will be compelled to attack but will avoid using its life drain.
 
If someone uses an action to try to convince the wight that the party can lay it down to rest, the wight gains advantage on its next save if the party beats a DC 10 check (ability/skill depends on approach taken).
 
Two turns of battle will awaken the ghouls in 29. The wight has no special command over these, but will attempt to drive them away (without attacking, though) on a successful Wisdom save.
 
**Treasure:**
 
On top of the chest is a small wooden mirror (25 gp), and a pair of engraved ivory dice (25 gp). The chest is locked (DC 15 to pick; can smash but will bring the ghouls to investigate).
 
Inside the chest is a pouch of coins (468 sp, 11 gp), a scroll of _Magic Weapon_, and some assorted jewelry (two brass rings worth 5 gp each and a silver bracelet worth 30 gp).
 
The shortswords are silvered, and are in good condition. The armor, however, is not, and the cloth and clothes in the room (including tapestries) are permeated with the smell of rot and probably not saleable.
