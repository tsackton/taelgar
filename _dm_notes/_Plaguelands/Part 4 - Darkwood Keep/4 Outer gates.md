_As you reach the far side of the bridge, the 15' outer wall rises in front of you. There is a small space, maybe 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, between the ravine and the walls, but to each side the walls angle towards the cliff face, and two short towers block access to walk around the walls. A stone archway filled with a iron-studded wooden double door sits between the two short stone towers._
 
The door is barred, but not locked. The easiest way to open it is to climb over the walls and lift the bar from the rear. The wall is difficult to climb but can keep trying -- whoever attempts to climb rolls a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If they fail but beat a DC 10, take 1d6 damage from falling once. If they fail but beat a DC 5, 2d6 damage. Otherwise, 3d6 damage plus make a lot of noise. If they use a rope, no need to make a climbing check, instead straight Dexterity check to toss a grappling hook to a solid place.
 
Grappling hook options:  
Beat a DC 15: hook is solidly lodged, climb without difficulty.  
Otherwise: takes a few (or many) tries, etc, narrate as normal If the check is just for time/noise. If they fail a DC 10, however, first person who climbs falls halfway up, taking 1d6 bludgeoning from fall. But then left them reset and climb without damage.
 
Other options, can improvise. Knock would work, e.g.
 
Breaking down the door is very difficult. DC 25 strength check. Up to three people can assist: the two strongest add their strength modifier, and the third gives advantage on roll. With some creativity (fashioning a battering ram of some kind), can get additional bonuses. If the total bonuses are enough that a 20 would succeed, then they succeed but roll determines how long it takes. Alternatively they can just chop the door to pieces with swords, etc, which will take 30 minutes or so. No matter what, these options **are loud**. This will draw all the skeletons to the guard house (**14 skeletons total, plus captain and Nugruk).**
 
The area between the outer and inner walls is short grass, pretty much barren. Again, nothing moves and they can note the silence, lack of animals, etc.
 
If they climb the walls, the two **skeleton archers** on front gate duty will attack. They use skeleton stat block, but have longbows (+4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage, range 150/600). They are behind 3/4 cover, so AC is effectively 18.
