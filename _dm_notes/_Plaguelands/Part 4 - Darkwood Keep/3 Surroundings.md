The castle is well-situated for defense.
 
Attack from the ground is nearly impossible. The castle is atop a steep, rocky outcropping. The northern and western sides are guarded by sheer cliffs, rises 80-100' from the land below. The main entrance to the castle crosses a narrow bridge on the northern side, requiring troops to move single file. On the southern side, the slope is less steep, but a scree field makes movement particularly challenging. The eastern side is perhaps the easiest approach - bare ledges but a climbable slope. This side is, however, protected by three Glyphs of Warding:
 
1. Triggers a _Grease_ spell, requiring disadvantage on Dex save because of slope, and falling prone also results in sliding down the slope
2. Triggers a _Sleet Storm_ spell, requiring disadvantage on Dex save because of slope, and falling prone also results in sliding down the slope
3. Triggers a _Tidal Wave_ spell, requiring disadvantage on Dex save because of slope, and falling prone also results in sliding down the slope
 
Each requires an Intelligence (Investigation) check against DC 16 to notice. If they proceed up the slope, give some clues in the description of the hike up (to anyone with passive perception \>= 15) about possible traps (water carved things, especially)
 
If they can climb the cliff to the spring (in general DC of climbing should be between 20 and 25 depending on strategy - these are not easy cliffs to scale), there is a flat area where spring emerges into a stream and cascades down as a waterfall. This area is cleared, and leads to the postern door.
 
**Postern Door - South and West are the same.**
 
Same mechanics as the front gate. The door is barred, but not locked. The easiest way to open it is to climb over the walls and lift the bar from the rear. The wall is difficult to climb but can keep trying -- whoever attempts to climb rolls a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If they fail but beat a DC 10, take 1d6 damage from falling once. If they fail but beat a DC 5, 2d6 damage. Otherwise, 3d6 damage plus make a lot of noise. If they use a rope, instead straight Dexterity check to toss a grappling hook to a solid place.
 
Grappling hook options:  
Beat a DC 15: hook is solidly lodged, climb without difficulty.  
Otherwise: takes a few (or many) tries, etc, narrate as normal If the check is just for time/noise. If they fail a DC 10, however, first person who climbs falls halfway up, taking 1d6 bludgeoning from fall. But then left them reset and climb without damage.  
Other options, can improvise. Knock would work, e.g.
 
Breaking down the door is very difficult. DC 25 strength check. Up to three people can assist: the two strongest add their strength modifier, and the third gives advantage on roll. With some creativity (fashioning a battering ram of some kind), can get additional bonuses. If the total bonuses are enough that a 20 would succeed, then they succeed but roll determines how long it takes. Alternatively they can just chop the door to pieces with swords, etc, which will take 30 minutes or so. No matter what, these options **are loud**. Entire castle moves to alert state.
 
If they climb the walls, the three **skeleton archers** on postern gate duty will attack. They use skeleton stat block, but have longbows (+4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage, range 150/600). They are behind 3/4 cover, so AC is effectively 18.
