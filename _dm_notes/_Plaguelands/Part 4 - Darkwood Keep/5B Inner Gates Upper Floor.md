**Light**: The rooms here have only modest windows / arrow slits to the outside, so the first and second floor, and all staircases, are considered dim light even in daylight (disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks). The third floor has larger windows and is normal light.
 
**Second floor**:
 
This floor is divided between apartments and guard chambers. Two additional **skeleton archers** are stationed here, one in each tower, and will rain arrows down on anyone moving between the outer wall and the inner wall, or attacking the gate.
 
The apartments have been largely trashed and the furniture swept aside in pieces.
 
However, a careful search (DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check) will reveal some coin (68 silver and 110 copper) and treasure (a silk pouch with four small gems each worth 10 gp), and some potion bottles (four potions -- two are smashed and not recoverable; the recoverable ones are a _potion of greater healing_ and a _potion of invisibility_).
 
The steps up to the third floor contain a crude alarm trap, set by Nugruk. A thin tripwire runs across the stairs; when it is tripped, it drops a collection of metal scraps held in a net above, which makes a loud clattering sound alerting Nugruk to intruders. The trap is not too hard to find (DC 11, Wisdom (Perception) check; or DC 16 passive perception).
 
**Third floor:**
 
The top floor of the gatehouse is a fancy apartment, which has been claimed by **General Nugruk.**
 
If Nugruk is here and has been warned by alarm, he will Ready _eldritch blast_ and target first person who comes up stairs. His lieutenant will Ready an attack and do the same. In addition, if the alarm has been triggered, two skeletons start in this room, 4 more arrive at beginning of round 3, and 2 more at beginning of round 4.
 
If he has not been warned, he will summon the skeletons in the gatehouse at the beginning of combat. Two will arrive at the start of the 2nd round of combat, 4 more during the 3rd round of combat, and 2 additional on 4th round, minus any that have been killed.
 
If Nugruk is on patrol, the **skeleton lieutenant** will be here alone, and will proceed as above. If the lieutenant and Nugruk are on the walls, the 2nd and 3rd floor are empty of enemies.
 
**Information:**
 
The necromancer is not one to keep detailed notes, but Nugruk has a map and a note from which plans can be inferred:
 
1. One labeled "The night following the Longest Night of the Year" showing a rough drawing of Darkwood keep, the keep to the east, Darkwood, [[Tygate]], and Adderfell. Battle plans show "undead horde" moving north from Darkwood, sweeping past [[Tygate]], and heading towards Adderfell. At the same time, show hobgoblins attacking from flanks, siege of keep to the east, and Darkwood Keep labeled with "Desecration of Vadokgul".
2. A short note from the necromancer to Nugruk, saying something like "stir up trouble, keep refugees moving north and Eofric focused on home. It is only a few short weeks until the night of the ritual when we can unleash our terror. Vadokgul will deal with any who come to invesgate and as his madness spreads, reinforcements from the east will find the way trecherous"
 
[Notes will be out on table if Nugruk is here; locked in chest if not]
 
Treasure:
 
Nugruk does not have much need for coin, but he likes gems and shiny things. There is a small locked chest (lockpicking DC 15, can be smashed in 10 minutes but will bring any skeletons in the guardhouse that are not yet dead/summoned). The chest contains 10 gems (3 obsidian worth 10 gp each, 4 lapis lazuili worth 15 gp each, 2 moss agate worth 10 gp each, and 1 onyx worth 50 gp), and 102 scattered silver pieces on the bottom, as well as a scroll case containing three scrolls: _gaseous form, dispel magic,_ and _comprehend languages._
