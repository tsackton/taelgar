**Castle Backstory**
 
Okay, let’s think about undead. The organized, solider aspect doesn't seem right. This is not an army, it is a seething mass of chaos waiting to be unleashed. The hobgoblins and Cinder Court are the organized soldiers, the undead are chaos and destruction impersonated.
 
So what is really happening here? The undead in the Darkwood Keep are the dead from the battle, a mix of humans and hobgoblins and some other creatures. They are only loosely kept in check by the will of the main boss.
 
What is the motivation of the main boss?
 
Chaos and terror. This undead is driven mad and full of an insatiable anger at life. This is a chaotic, primal fury that is barely contained. However the "general" is more of a lawful evil type, an emissary from the Necromancer.
 
So we have two kinds of undead in the Keep. There are the wild, crazed ones created by the chaotic angry of the main boss, and a smaller subset of "solider" types.
 
Thematically the wild/crazy types should be "fleshy" -- zombies, ghouls, ghasts, etc  
The "soldier" types should be bony - skeletons.  
Perhaps also some non-evil types, ghosts etc? People in the castle who were killed after the main boss moved in with its undead ray….?
 
Start making up rooms / encounters and see how it plays out…
   

More notes:  
The skeleton contingent includes the skeleton general and 12 skeleton guards (8 archers on walls, 4 body guards for general). If the general is killed, all skeletons collapse as they are controlled by him.
   

There needs to be at least four different ways to find out that keep inhabitants were taken alive into Darkwood:

1. The main boss will reveal plan if they get him monologuing
2. Clues/notes in two rooms (wizard's room, gatehouse/Nugruk)
3. Talking to ghost/specter/whatever of blacksmith
4. Physical clues around castle (need to think of what these would be)
5. Priest in chapel
