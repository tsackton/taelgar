This is the private solarium of the commander of the castle. It is furnished with a large wardrobe, a desk, a large chest. One area is cleared for martial practice.
 
The dead body of the commander is slumped on the floor near the chest. DC 15 Int (Invesitgation) or DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) will reveal he died of his wounds several weeks ago. He is wearing chain mail armor and a nice cloak embroidered with the heraldry of Sembara. A long sword is laying at his feet. DC 15 perception to notice a key in his hand.
 
If the party comes within 10 feet of the body, a ghost will rise from the body.
 
The ghost is sad and depressed, despairing on the fall of the keep and the inability of his spirit to join the Father. He will need some convincing / reassuring to talk. But if they get him talking, party can learn about the battle — small army of skeletons and hobgoblins seemed to appear from nowhere in courtyard in middle of the night. Slew servants and workers, captured soldiers. We were caught off guard but should have been prepared. Had been unusually quiet for weeks and I had relaxed, my fault. I believe most of the garrison was captured, at least 200 men and women. Don’t know where they were taking them or what the purpose was, but they have left the castle. Before the attack we were expecting some trouble from the Darkwood - spiders and other beasts of the woods stirred up, according to Rangers. Maybe that is where the captives were taken, but why keep them alive?
 
Can also give information about Vadokgul: a evil presence, feel him in my mind all the time, pushing me to devour the living, hard to resist his call to succumb to the darkness and insanity.
 
**Treasure:**
 
The ghost will attack if anyone attempts to approach chest or take his sword (which is a +1 long sword), after a warning.
 
If party brings his body to chapel and lays him to rest (or kills ghost), can loot chest. There is a key on his body, otherwise DC 15 to pick lock or DC 20 to break lock (or 10 minutes of hacking and bashing to open chest).
 
Chest has 263 gp, 1138 sp, one potion of frost giant strength, two potions of healing, one potion of greater healing, and three sending stones (two of a pair, the other missing its partner; the commander gave it to a ranger scout named Efrin who was heading into the Darkwood weeks ago).
