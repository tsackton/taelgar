This is a small room that seems to have once been separately by a wooden divider that has since been destroyed. Three small beds and a writing desk are crammed into this room, but are largely destroyed. It seems a quick but bloody and vicious battle took place here.
 
_As you open the door to this room, a sickening stench pours out of the room, sickening you._
 
This has the effect of a stinking cloud save with a spell DC of 12. Everyone must make a Constitution saving throw; those that fail are retching and vomiting and cannot take actions (can still move, and use a bonus action or a reaction).
 
_Inside the room, you see scenes of destruction. Two, maybe three, small beds have been destroyed, cut to pieces by some vicious attack. A small writing desk is thoroughly smashed and scorch marks suggest that some papers were burned. Three bodies lay collapsed in the destruction. As you open the door, they rise and lumber towards you._
 
These are three **cursed ghouls.** They will attack immediately, and don't suffer the effects of the stinking cloud, which extends throughout the room and 1 square into the hall. A stiff wind can clear it out in 1-5 turns depending on how stiff.
 
One round into combat, the noise will draw the **Wight** in room 27 to enter the fray.
 
Searching the room reveals signs of a battle, obviously. No treasure, and no explicit clues.
