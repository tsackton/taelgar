The inner walls are about 40' high, and at least 10'' thick. There is a walkway along the top, generally 5' wide. The four corner towers, gatehouse, and two rear towers all have wooden doors that can be barred (but are generally not, unless noted) leading onto the walkway, which is protected by crenellations and arrow slits.
 
Eight **skeleton archers** are stationed on these walls, with orders to shoot any living creature that approaches. They are divided as follows:
 
Rear postern door: three archers  
Side postern door: three archers  
Front walls: one on each side of gates
 
The skeletons are not particularly smart and have not been ordered to raise the alarm, so a battle will not automatically trigger alert state. Loud spells, other things that seem like they would make loud noises, but it's a judgement call.
 
Passive perception is only 9, so if party is sneaking along top of wall they should be easy to surprise.
