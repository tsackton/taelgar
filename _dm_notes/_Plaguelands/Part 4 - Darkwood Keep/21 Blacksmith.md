This is the blacksmiths workshop - forge, related.
 
When party is close, hear clanging. If enter, the blacksmith is working on a blade, but forge is cold and the blacksmith’s head is lolling back and forth on its shoulders. Will turn and look at party for a minute while mindlessly banging.
 
If they get within 10 feet will growl, drool dripping from mouth, and start to lurch forward to attack. This is a **relentless rotting zombie** the additionally has advantage on undead fortitude saves.
 
No treasure, this ares has been throughly looted.
