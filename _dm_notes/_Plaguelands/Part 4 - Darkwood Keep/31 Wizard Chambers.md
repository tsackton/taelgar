_The door to this room has been smashed open, shattered into many pieces. The room beyond the door looks like a bedchamber and study, but the center of the room has been scorched and burned as if by a large fire. The bed is mostly burned, and there are black marks across the floor. Several piles of ash with bits of bones sticking out are scattered around the floor. Still mostly intact is a desk and a small bookshelf in one corner._
 
This is the study and bedchamber of the resident wizard. She tried to escape the undead invasion with a fireball and then flying out the window, but was shot down by archers from the wall. Her body is marked on the map. If the party finds her, she is wearing robes, two pouches with small dried meat and cheese (1 ration), an empty water skin, two empty potion bottles, a Wand of the War Mage +1, and her Spellbooks.
 
**In the Room:**
 
If the party comes within 20 feet of desk, a deep woman’s voice will start speaking: “Living creatures, warning, undead have overrun castle, leading many captives to the Darkwood fate unknown. If anyone is left to hear this, flee now!”
 
Searching the room reveals some treasures: under the desk is a small chest with a pouch of 412 sp; in addition several of the books seem to have survived the blast. They are each a medium item, are worth 10-20 go to the right buyer. Titles are_: Arcana Elemental; The Uses of Gems; The Lay of Udiel_ and _Thoughts on the Nature of the Divine._
