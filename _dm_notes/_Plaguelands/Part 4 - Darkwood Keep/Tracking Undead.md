**The Skeleton Army**
 
The skeleton army under Captain Nugruk consists of **fourteen skeleton archers**, a **lieutenant**, and **Nugruk** himself, along with **Nugruk's skeletal warhorse**. Their mission is to keep an eye on the Darkwood Keep, and "unleash the beast" when the time is right, on the solstice. In the mean time, Nugruk can't help but create a bit of fear. They will maintain an organized defense of the castle, man the walls, and keep the gates locked, and the defenses intact. It is not a full garrison, but they do what they can. The doppleganger was Nugruk's idea, to try to keep attention away until the 21st. They tend to remain on the walls or in the guard house, and will not go into Vadokgul's territory. These creatures should be almost solider-like in tactics and abilities, and be more creative and organized than typical for undead.
 
Tracking (alive) - killed
 
Skeleton guard (14): killed - 2  
Lieutenant (1):  
Nugruk (1):  
Nugruk's warhorse (1):
 
Nugruk's movements:  
Nugruk often rides out of the castle, or takes his lieutenant and two skeletons on a patrol of the walls. He will not enter Vadokgul's domain, however. When the party approaches castle, roll 1d10: 1 - Nugruk and warhorse are on patrol out of castle; 2 - Nugruk is on walls with 2 skeletons and lieutenant (remove from guardhouse), 3 - Nugruk is in stables with horse, having just returned or just departing for patrol, 4-10 - Nugruk is in quarters. If rolled a 1, he returns during next long rest party takes, goes to stables, and then to quarters. Otherwise, roll again every hour for where he moves to.

**Long bow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack._ +4 to hit, range 150/600, one target. _Hit_: 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage.

**The Restless Dead**
 
Ghasts, ghouls, and zombies are created by the restless aura of **Vadokgul.** Any creature that dies in his aura, and is not blessed and buried on hallowed ground rises as undead at the next sunset. These creatures are mindless and simply lust for living flesh. They will lie dormant until something living comes close, and then rise and try to eat it. Those of strong will and mind may retain some semblance of their former personality, in which case their spirit may linger as a ghost rather than be consumed by the rage of **Vadokgul**. They are present in the courtyard outbuildings, as well as the blacksmith and the artisan's tower. These creatures should be mindless, wrathful, and hungry. A mix of ghouls/ghasts and zombies makes sense, but the zombies should all be reflavored to have a bite attack.

**Pike.** _Melee Weapon Attack._ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target. _Hit_: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

If the target can see Nugluk, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this creature's Dreadful Glare for the next 24 hours.

Vadokgul's Horde
 
Vadokgul is mostly mad, driven by the raw darkness of the Shadowfell. He maintains direct control over some zombies and wights in the inner keep / great hall. These will not leave the inner keep, but will move to reinforce each other. These creatures are "typical" undead in that they are driven by compulsion. They are intermediate between 1 and 2 in terms of tactics, and will tend to use weapons if possible, so often these will be zombie guards or zombie hobgoblins, wearing remains of armor and fighting with weapons. Some may have ranged attacks. Consider also reflavoring some weaker wights, based on something like a specter stat block. Many of the creatures in this category should have sunlight sensitivity, including the main boss, which will make things a bit easier, but also this is where the life drain undead will live which can be dangerous.

**Whispers of Madness.** Vadokgul chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 7 (1d8+3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of Vadokgul's choice that Vadokgul can see. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.
 
**Howling Babble (Recharge 6):** Each creature within 30 feet of Vadokgul must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (2d8+3) psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
 
**Rotting Death.** When the zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of noxious gas. All creatures within 10 feet of the zombie must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and succumbs to zombie rot (as described in **Bite**). On success, the target takes half damage, and is not diseased.
 
**ACTIONS**

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or succumb to zombie rot. The diseased creature can't regain hit points, has its movement speed reduced by 10 ft, and its hit point maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) at the end of every 24 hours that elapse. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and reanimates as a zombie 24 hours later. The disease lasts until cured by _Lesser Restoration_ or other effects that remove disease, such as a Paladin's Lay on Hands ability.
