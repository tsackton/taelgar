## Rangers

### Fianna

Ranger, human druid, encountered on road to Adderfell

### Martin

Ranger, human archer, encountered on road to Adderfell
### Efrin 

[[Efrin-Character-Sheet.pdf]]

Efrin grew up poor in [Tywingha city], to indifferent parents who were not able to provide for her. She spent most of her time at inns and taverns near the docks, earning a few spare coin as a stablehand and finding a warm place to sleep with the horses when her parents turned her out. 
  
After a trying childhood, she eventually found a place working in a rough and tumble inn outside the walls of the city, taking care of the horses, oxen, and other pack animals of traders bringing goods from the Wild Marches. Something, however, haunted her dreams; she could never quite remember what but held on to a sense of an image of warmth and laughter. Eventually, she could not rest with the feeling of something calling her, and set out south towards the Wild Marches, taking up with a caravan of halfings who needed someone to tend their horses. 

Traveling through Addermarch towards Adderfell, the dreams got stronger and she felt pulled towards a standing stone circle, and fell through into the Feywild. There, she learned that she was, in fact, a daughter of [some fey]. Shaken, she fled back to Taelgar, but started developing her connection to the Fey, eventually accepting a patron [XXXX]. Soon after, she found the Rangers and became a scout, traveling with her sprite familiar through the Plaguelands, keeping an eye out for evil.

Before Darkwood Keep was attacked, there were rumors of things happening in the Darkwood, so Efrin was sent to scout it out, with a sending stone to report back to base. She discovered signs of a Cinder Court base in the woods, and has been heading in that direction to try to figure out what the goals of the Cinder Court cultists are, and why they have a base in the Darkwood. There are signs of disturbance - normally the forest is a delicate balance between good (or at least not evil) fey, dark fey, and spiders/beasts such as owlbears. But with the Cinder Court the dark fey have been empowered and have been pushing forward, and riling up the spiders and beasts. Efrin is fairly sneaky and has a sprite familiar (archfey patron, pact of the chain), has been relying on invisible sprite scouting ahead to avoid danger and learn info. Still no one is quite sure why the Cinder Court -- which is largely a group of humans and hobgoblins -- has a base in the Darkwood that seems connected to evil fey creatures and the Shadowfell.

### Maglor

[[Maglor-Character-Sheet.pdf]]

Maglor grew up in a small Elven community on the old border with Dunmar, back in the days when the Elves were more numerous, more open, and more friendly with the world.

When Cha'mutte struck, Maglor immediately joined the war effort. He was a young, brash squire in the joint forces of the Elves during the great battles against Cha'mutte. During the chaos and war in the Blood Years that followed, he fought as a solider in the battles in the North. 

During these wars, his company was trapped by a hobgoblin force more than 10 times their size. Maglor was the sole survivor of the massacre, hiding under the dead body of a comrade. 

Scared, distraught, and horribly ashamed of himself, he fled south towards Sembara, staying far from civilization and especially humans. After long years of wandering, wracked by guilt, he eventually found his way to the Wild Marches of Sembara, and the Rangers. 

Although he has not seen one of his people in years and years, and remains ashamed of his failures in the Blood Years, he has found a new purpose and a new devotion to life in the the mission of the Rangers.

Here is the NPC I made - melee ranger high elf (Elendil), fought in the war against Cha'mutte and the hobgoblin wars in the years after, saw his entire company destroyed in an ambush (along with most of his family and friends, as the elves took a very heavy toll in the wars after the fall of Cha'mutte). Spent a while wandering in the far north, eventually made his way to Sembara, and in particular the Wild Marches (borderlands between the unsettled and magically destroyed Plaguelands -- the territory the red mist spread through during the end of our high school campaign -- and Sembara). Joined up with the Rangers (who probably need a new name...), who spend a lot time patrolling the Wild Marches. Has been in the area for past 50 years or so. 

Based on the Primeval Guardian ranger, from an [Unearthed Arcana](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/2017_01_UA_RangerRogue_0117JCMM.pdf), but all the relevant stuff is on the character sheet -- the main class ablity is being able to turn into a tree basically during combat (5' movement but +5' reach and other benefits). Designed around polearm in combat (15' reach in tree form), with javelins as backup. The image is the elven fighters in the beginning of the prologue of LOTR (Fellowship) fighting Sauron, but for mechanical reasons (Strength build) uses javelins instead of bow as ranged option. 

His role in the party is basically supposed to be a guide, and also an opportunity to do a little role-playing and world-building outside of town, giving them someone to interact with. The kids don't really roleplay in character that much but they like stories about the world a lot, and they like world-building details (they were at a market in a town a few sessions ago and bought a book about Drankorian history and Nathaniel's character started reading it on the spot and Nathaniel was quite disappointed I didn't have a real book about Drankorian history already written). In 2-3 sessions they are likely heading into a trackless, dangerous forest and so Maglor is designed around making that not impossible and overly daunting for them (e.g. with forest as favored terrain).

On the campaign: Generally in southern Sembara right now there has been a lot of raiding and attacks stirred up by hobgoblins and a mysterious group of humans, hobgoblins, and allies know as the Cinder Court. So lots of refugees have been leaving the southernmost settled areas and fleeing to stronger towns, etc. Currently the party is traveling south from Adderfell (the biggest town and the Earl's seat in the Earldom of Addermarch, one of the WIld Marches protecting the border of Sembara -- loosely inspired by a tiny bit of reading about the medieval Welsh Marches) to investigate Darkwood Keep, the southernmost military outpost of Addermarch, which has gone silent for weeks. A doppleganger recently reported that all was well, but was discovered by the party and Earl Eofric (the ruler of Addermarch), so everyone is quite concerned that something bad has happened at the Keep. The local leader of the Rangers sent Maglor along with the party to aid and make sure that the Rangers got word of what was happening as quickly as possible. 

Since leaving Adderfell (in case you didn't hear from Zachary), they've rescued a grumpy shepherd from giant vultures, dealt with their horse running away in a thunderstorm (which also made the road a muddy mess), camped the night in a ruined Drankorian road house that doubled as an occasional makeshift Ranger shelter, and then the next morning found a chopped down orchard with a Cinder Court flag planted, and tracked the offenders (bugbear + hogobin raiding party) and killed them. 


Rough map of the area is below. The small circle on the lake is Adderfell, the capital. The area is know for apples, cider, brandy, and dairy (kind of like Normandy but with a northern Virginia climate). The keep where they are heading is at the bottom of the map. Maglor would also be well aware that this area, especially as you get closer to the border, has a lot of "leakage" from Shadowfell (/shadow fey), and the original inhabitants (before Drankor) constructed various magic circles to protect their lands from things crossing over, but these have not been maintained. One of the Ranger patrol duties now is to keep an eye out for boggles, darklings, various other weird fey creatures out for mischief and kill or drive them away. 


Anyway, that is what I have. Happy to fill in any other details you want but you can also just make stuff up.

## Adderfell

### Earl Eofric

Name: Earl Siggar Eofric  
Title: Earl Eofric, Earl of [Adderfell](_DM_/OneNote/00_Notes/NPCs/Adderfell/Adderfell.md) and Lord Protector of the Marches  
Bodily appearance: Well-muscled; Broken nose  
General appearance: Chestnut brown hair; cruel face; soft-spoken; well-kept dress;   
Memorable mannerisms: Frowns  
Interesting fact: Very limited social circle - many subordinates but few/no friends & peers  
Hope or fear: Fear related to violence  
Talent: unbelievably lucky
 
The Earl is a hard man, with experience fighting hobgoblins and skirmishing with incursions from the [Plaguelands](Plaguelands). When his father was Earl, he was the lord of a keep on the border (unusually for an heir). He was known for getting his soldiers out of difficult situations and developed a reputation as a good luck charm. Despite his popularity, he was always a distant and gruff commander, never getting close to anyone even his close advisors. While he was a popular choice among the commoners for Earl, his rule has not been without difficulties arising from his closed personality and terse style.
 
He believes that his success as a commander earlier in his career was at least in part unearned due to fate. This has made him perhaps overly cautious and afraid of challenging enemies directly, and as an aside has made him a dedicated follower of the Wildling, which is quite unusual for a lord and commander.
 
Despite these flaws, he wants to do right by the Earldom and he is genuinely worried about the developments over the past year and increasing raiding activity in the past months (and particularly concerned about increasing violence in Adderfell itself).

Tries to make sure goals are aligned but will prioritize needs of Rangers first, especially long-term view over short term political goals.

Flaws: Doesn’t like cities and is usually impatient to get away, although duty requires that she spend significant time in them

### Lady Zivkara

Lady Zivkara is a northerner, originally from Skavish Isles. She left home to train in magical arts and eventually settled in Sembara; traveled to Adderfell drawn by rumors of old religions which she is particularly fascinated by. 
 
Had a rough childhood on the Isles and has adopted her new country with passion and zeal, and especially believes strongly in the idea of the citizen and the health of the public; prefers defensive postures to forward deployment even when it may be tactically unwise, biased by her study of abjuration magic.

Generally goes to the market each morning and returns to his shop in the afternoons, where he sells books but also does bookbinding, scribing, and related work.
