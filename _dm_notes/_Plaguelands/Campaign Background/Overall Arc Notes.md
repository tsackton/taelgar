(big bads: undead in keep, level 4; necromancer in woods, level 6??; cinder court - level 10???)


So, the overall scene:
 
Cinder Court started when a hobgoblin warlock with a Shadow Fey patron started organizing scattered bands of hobgoblins eking out a living in the Plaguelands.
 
She started calling herself the Cinder Queen. Her ultimate goal is to invade Sembara, and take over good agriculture land. Ultimately, enslaving the whole country and becoming extremely rich and powerful.
 
Her patron is making a move in a incredibly old conflict between Shadowfell and Feywild. Cannot directly travel from Shadowfell to Feywild (at least without strong magic), have to go through material plane. This area in southern Sembara has known portals to Feywild, and was once long ago (before Drankor) the heartland of a civilization deeply connected to the Feywild. So the ultimate goal of the Cinder Queen's patron is to use her to help establish a beachhead in the material plane to use to mount an invasion of the Feywild.
 
Hobgoblin invasion plan:
 
The main invasion force is planned to strike at speed through the lowlands of Tywingha, and sweep north behind the main defenses along the Wild Marches (**when? How will plan changed based on success against necromancer or failure?**). The passable terrain on this route is narrow, and has to thread the needle between the outer forts of Tywingha, the Elves in the forest, and the Lizardfolk, so the plan is to use stealth and Shadowfell magic.
 
However, increase chance of success the Cinder Queen has additional plans:

1. Addermarch is one of the strongest, richest, and best organized of the Wild Marches. A flanking move through Addermarch could hit the back of the army and the supply lines, so a major goal is to distract/harry Addermarch to keep it from bringing aid to bear. To do this, one of the Cinder Queen's lieutenants, a necromancer, has been tasked with creating fear and turmoil in the Addermarch.
    1. Three lines of attack here:
        1. First are hobgoblin / Cinder Court raiders; based out of two forward camps, one in woods between Dunwick and Adderfell, one in the hills east of Darkwood Keep. The forward commander in the woods is Lord Shadowheart (human); the commander in the hills is Lord XXXX (hobgoblin)
        2. Second are Cinder Court infiltration into Addermarch, especially targeting Adderfell. [this has been largely shut down by PCs]
        3. Third and most importantly is the undead invasion planned. Hobgoblins (under different commander than necormancer) are not so happy about this, as they aren't really excited about fighting with undead, but are happy that undead army will bear the brunt of the retaliation from Addermarch. First step in this plan was the isolate Darkwood Keep, which is otherwise a strong point making invasion from Darkwood difficult; with that accomplished, plan is to raise an undead army in the Darkwood and then march north. Once army begins to march, hobgoblin raiders attack from flanks.
            1. Major hobgoblin force is to east, currently besieging castle 20 miles march east of Darkwood. These two castles overlook the main pass, to east of 2nd castle is very rough, hilly terrain. This army is maybe 200 strong. Plan is for around 75 to stay to maintain siege, and rest to move when undead army moves
            2. Minor hobgoblin force west of Darkwood (maybe 100 total, including a forward base with 20 or so in woods). This force will also move to attack when undead army marches.
    2. There is a third castle in the hills far East. Hope is to bypass it completely, but scouts plan to keep an eye on movements.
2. Wild March through which former trade road goes is not as wealthy or well-settled as Addermarch, but is more heavily fortified by Sembaran forces. Cinder Queen plans a feint here, with a significant force of hobgoblins (several hundred) that will attack and fall back into the Plaguelands, hoping to draw pursuit. Cinder Court has also been trying to stir up beasts and monstrosities in this area to create turmoil in border forts.
   

What is Sembara doing?

1. Major source of concern has been attacks against Trade March; several contingents of Sembaran knights marching their now to support border forts in area.
2. Currently unaware of movement of troops towards Tywingha.
3. News of trouble in Adderfell will reach court soon; spur more attention there.
 
What is Addermarch doing?

1. News of siege against eastern fort has not yet reached Adderfell, but scouts are heading that way and news will arrive shortly from Rangers.
2. No news of Darkwood Keep.
3. Rangers are now aware of western hobgoblin front, and will report back to Adderell in a few days.
 
**(as of Day 4 / Dec 9th):**
 
Earl Eofric is now aware of western hobgoblin front, and news of siege against keep #2. Has sent riders through the land calling banners to raise a force as quickly as possible. Rangers are also mobilizing.
 
By Day 7 / Dec 12th a sizable force will be gathered in Adderfell ready to march, but uncertain of which direction to go.
