Meriele: left homeland looking for issues with Plaguelands; what happened? She thinks she traveled uneventfully through wilderness and was captured by hobgoblins south of Addermarch border, then transferred to Kobolds
 
This memory doesn’t make sense, though. Why was she transferred to kobolds? Why captured?
 
What actually happened:  
-write up to give to Kate if modified memory is removed  
(Saw Darkwood Keep; knows undead presence; was going to be used with modified memory as decoy but escaped, was caught after escaping by kobolds, memory modified but rescued)
