Start Arc 2 at level 4. Want to end Arc 2 just after leveling up to level 5.
 
Will start at around 3000 XP, want to hit ~6000 XP (at most) session before final battle in Darkwood Keep
 
Each XP unit is 250 XP, so need a max of 12 encounters. At a rate of 3 encounters per session, this is about 4 sessions.

Change this:
 
**FOR SESSION 3:**  
**300 XP - beating cult fanatic etc**  
**150/75/0 - stopping curse**
 
**SESSION 4:**  
**150 - doppleganger/council meeting**
 
**Total:**  
**Min -- 500**  
**Max -- 650**
   

**650+500 = 1,150**  
**1150 + 1650 = 2800**  
**1150 + 1975 = 3125**
 
**Min 2800**  
**Max 3275**
