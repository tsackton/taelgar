1. Character updates (everyone gets an opportunity for a redo at this stage)
    1. Talk to Isaac to make sure he is happy with his spells, skills, meta-magic, etc; possibly share a sorcerer guide to see what he thinks; discuss his personality traits a bit more and see if he can roleplay a bit
      
    3. Check in with Nathaniel to make sure he is happy and see if he wants a more detailed background
      
    5. Talk to Kate about character, background, role playing, see if she wants to change anything (e.g. skills) or flesh stuff out more; also need to update spells and languages
      
    
2. Campaign / lore
    1. Finish transferring everything to OneNote from before, also write up session summaries and a dramatis personae that I can share with players
      
    3. Make broad outline of entire campaign arc, at least through Darkwood Keep / Darkwood exploration
        1. Include ideal level progression and then figure out how many encounters needed at each place / scene
        2. Set the scene for actually making up the adventures in Arc 2
          
        
    4. Figure out issues / plot hooks:
        1. Kate's travels in Plaguelands before and how she was captured
        2.   
            
        3. link with Shadow realm and how shadows found them (have some time because unicorn will scare off pursuit for a while)
          
        5. What is going on with magic and the shadow realm and corruption, e.g. how does Evendur's dream connect
          
        7. Where is hobgoblin base and what is happening (actually) in the Plaguelands
          
        
3. Rules
    1. Write up travel time system
    2. Make notes for checking in on rules
