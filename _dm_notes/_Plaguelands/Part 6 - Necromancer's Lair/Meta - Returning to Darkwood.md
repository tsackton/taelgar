Notes for session 9/27 after long absence:
 
Introduction - quick run down of story so far, rescuing the dryad, Efrin and the path to the Cinder Court base in the Darkwood
 
Assume they continue along the trail; Efrin's familiar (Zepha) will notice the hobgoblins ahead, can decide how to approach (attempt ambush, etc)
 
Hobgoblin battle / avoid
 
Come to Cinder Court base - describe it, etc; should seem overwhelming for frontal assault
 
Remind about Faraster, Lord of Gloaming
 
Stopping point either after summoning / talking to him, or before, after scouting base, or possibly right after battle?
