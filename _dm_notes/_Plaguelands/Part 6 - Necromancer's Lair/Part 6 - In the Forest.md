A few small encounters to wrap up the trip through Darkwood.
 
Time:  
Dec 17th early afternoon  
Ritual occurs the night of Dec 21st
 
**Start**
 
_You have been traveling in the Darkwood for several days now, slogging through the deep, twisted forests along the river, until earlier this morning you finally found your way to the source of the river. A peaceful, quiet hill beckoned, seemingly a safe place to scout and investigate. As you climbed, only Evendur saw the truth -- this was a hill of thorns and death, that had already trapped Efrin. Burning the dark thornbushes broke the illusion, and now you find yourself on top of a dark, dead hill, looking south into the hills where you know the Cinder Court base looms._
 
[can give them a moment to talk to Efrin, introduce themselves, get organized]
 
DM notes:  
-gloss over how they get to the base; as they descend have them quickly pick up a trail that is not too hard to follow, see signs of disruption (trees cut down, things burned)  
-figure it will take a day to get to the outskirts of the base, where they will need to make some decisions about what to do, so unless they do something weird, assume it will be early afternoon Dec 18th when they arrive. They will have after of Dec 18th, plus all day on the 19th/20th/21st to stop ritual before it begins at sunset on the 21st.  
-the order the two encounters below happens is not important
 
**Cinder Court Encounter**
 
Premise: a Cinder Court patrol will come across the party, who will have to kill or capture them in order to avoid detection -- patrol was sent to investigate smoke column coming up from the hills.
 
Consequences:  
-if patrol escapes and reports back, base will be on high alert, making any kind of stealth or deception harder  
-if patrol is killed entirely, will delay suspicion as the Darkwood is deadly and patrols go missing occasionally for no clear reasons  
-it will be possible to get information from captives, but would need high intimidation rolls and/or very clever bribes
 
Encounter:  
Patrol is 6 hobgoblins, 1 hobgoblin captain, and 1 hobgoblin devastator  
They are nervous about the forest, and not being particularly sneaky, so it could be possible to surprise them, in which case could be an easy encounter if they deal with devastator  
If/once they realize they are outmatched, they will form up to protect a messenger who will run to bring news back to base (or fly if devastator is alive)
 
If the captain is alive, no one will talk or give any information no matter what. However, if the captain is dead, the regular hobgoblins will talk (they hate being in darkwood, etc, maybe a bit of camp layout) with a DC 16 Intimidation/Persuasion check -- they are relatively well trained troops but really hate being in the darkwood and so the right application of pressure or bribes can help. The devastator will scoff at threats, but will be tempted by spells he doesn't know, as he wants power.
 
As they are on patrol, don't have any treasure with them.
 
**Standing Stone Encounter**
 
Premise: the Cinder Court presence / ritual is allowing the Shadowfell to seep into the Darkwood and upset the balance of powers in a way that many of the denizens do not like. Old standing stones that used to guard weak points between the planes have been cracking.
 
Consequences:  
-if they save the ancient dryad, she will provide them with a way to contact Faraster, the Lord of Gloaming, who is one of the fey lords who command loyalty from the non-evil denizens of the Darkwood. He is not exactly good, but he is certainly not evil, and can help if offered the right incentive.  
-the dryad will pass along a magic item as a reward  
-if they ignore, or fail, then nothing bad happens, just continue
 
Encounter:
 
_As you continue through the forest, you see ahead a glimpse of sunlight and a clearing in the trees. Standing in the center of the clearing is the largest oak you have see, growing so dense and tangled that it leaves no room for anything else to grow in the shadows around it. Standing at the edge of the clearing is a tall granite stone, moss growing across it, with a large crack running down the middle. Dark, black mist is slowly seeping out of the crack, and collecting in swirls around the tree, tendrils intertwined with the branches._
 
_Evendur, as you glance at this scene, you feel an echo of laughter in the back of your mind, and a vision flashes before your eyes of a deep, clear pool below the tree, filling slowly with shadow, and a strong pull as the shadows are drawn away south by some force gathering them for a nefarious purpose._
 
_As you look up from this vision, you notice something seems to be struggling against the shadowy tendrils binding the tree._
 
The dryad Acalypha, one of the elder dryads of the forest, is being slowly consumed by the Shadowfell, which is seeping in through the cracked stone.
 
To cure her, the stone must be repaired.
 
If the tendrils are destroyed, can be repaired with a _Mending_ cantrip or similar, as long as the runes can be reconstructed.
 
Destroying the tendrils requires dealing 15 points radiant damage or more to each tendril in one strike. They have an AC of 13, and will as a reaction attempt to inflict madness on anyone targeting them. DC 12 Wisdom save; unless tendril is destroyed in one hit.
 
To properly reconstruct runes requires a DC 14 Intelligence check, with advantage if you know Skaegish (and hence recognize alphabet).
 
Alternatively, dryad is trapped by a Sorrowsworn (The Lonely or The Lost) on the other side; if killed, dryad can escape.
 
If tendrils are destroying, dryad will speak, giving two things:

1. A branch of the tree breaks off to become a staff (figure out what it does exactly, will be utility spells for Evendur basically)
2. A blossom that when crushed will summon Faraster, Lord of Gloaming
