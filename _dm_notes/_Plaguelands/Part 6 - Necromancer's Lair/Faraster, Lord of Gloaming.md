**Setup**
 
If they use the item to summon Faraster, he will appear before them:
 
_As you crush the blossom time seems to stand still for a moment, the air shimmers, and stepping out of thin air a man appears._
 
Faraster is a tall, lithe, silver-haired fey lord, sort of elf-like in appearance but with silver-gray and small black flowers braided into his hair, and with pure black eyes.
 
He is concerned with the Cinder Court, as he does not approve of their activities, but so far has been reluctant to risk his followers in a straight attack, especially has he sees the touch of the Shadowfell in everything and does not necessarily want to provoke a direct war.
 
However, he will be willing if the party retrieves an item for him:
 
_Many years ago, before the shadows fell on these woods, there was still great evil lurking in some parts fo the forest. My friend and companion, Elohara, the Lady of Dawn, sought to protect us from a great beast that made its lair in the swamps to the west of here -- a many headed lizard of impossible size, mouths filled with razor sharp teeth, a danger out of myth and legend, endlessly hungry, and rotten to its core. Elohara sought to kill this beast and ventured forth, but never returned. She carried with her a circlet adorned with diamonds in which much of the power of our kingdom was imbued. Were you to recover this circlet for me, perhaps I would be able to help you with the Cinder Court._
 
The hydra's lair is easy to find, as Faraster can grant one person the ability to sense the direction and distance to the circlet.
 
At this point, if it is not clear that time is of the essence, Faraster will warn them to hurry, as he can feel the pull of the Shadowfell growing stronger.
 
**Approaching the Lair**
 
After about 3/4 of a day of travel, they will approach a swampy area, clearly dark and dreary. In the swamp are three possible encounters before they meet the Hydra:
 
1. A swarm of about 50 stirges attack, flying about and draining blood. Split among 5 PCs, this is 10 stirges each.
    1. Depending on AC, a certain number will attach:
    
    AC 10/11 -\> 7  
    AC 12/13 -\> 6  
    AC 14/15 -\> 5  
    AC 16/17 -\> 4  
    AC 18/19 -\> 3  
    AC 20/21 -\> 2  
    AC 22/23 -\> 1  
    Ac 24+ -\> 0
    
    3. For each one that attaches, character takes 5 * number attached damage each stirge turn. Any attack almost autohits and kills one; AOE kills lots
 
1. Ettin camp -- some ettins lurk in the swamps catching and eating what they can
2. Corpse flower, maybe tuned to be a little less deadly
 
**Hydra Lair:**
 
Obvious when approaching, describe death/corruption. Swamp with some water the hydra can retreat too, although not super-deep.
 
Treasure - circlet of stars, plus something else? What is in a hydra lair?
