**Overview:**
 
Hobgoblins refuse to enter the tower or the pit. Instead, this is the domain of Nugruk, and especially Aelech, the necromancer and leader of this branch of the Cinder Court.
 
The tower itself is made of shadowstuff, bound by magic of the Shadowfell and a cursed place. Creatures of the Feywild cannot set foot in here without taking damage every turn, and all others feel a deep unease and a lethargy overcome them (initiative rolls and Perception checks are at disadvantage).
 
Efrin will not enter the tower, so this will just be the core party.
 
Undead in the tower cannot be fully destroyed while the connection to the Shadowfell is active, and will reanimate 24 hours after death, even if burned.
 
The tower itself draws power from the Shadowfell, which is spilling out to corrupt nearby ley lines and grab power from them. The shadowfell portal on level 4 serves as the power source for the ritual, and if it is destroyed the ritual will be stopped. The ritual requires 7 nights of casting, with the last 24 hours fully concentrating, so has already started.
 
**Level 1: Storage**
 
The bottom level of the tower is largely storage, primarily food for the prisoners and some ritual supplies. It is guarded but lightly.
 
**1.1: Entryway**
 
The entryway to the tower is guarded by six specters, under control of the wraithlord who is one of the necromancers undead allies. These specters have normal stats, but are shadowy and dark, with tendrils of the same gray mist coming off of them. If they are losing, one will ascend through the ceiling to warn tower of attack.
 
**1.2: Storage**
 
This room contains a large number of weapons of various kinds, in various states of disrepair. Most are also swirling with the shadow tendrils of gray mist. These weapons will cause Shadowfell despair on any who take more than 50% of their hit points in damage from them.
 
**1.3: Storage**
 
This room contains sacks of grain and other low-quality foodstuffs. Eating or drinking anything in the tower causes the same effects as staying in the tendrils of gray mist in area 7 of Cinder Court base.
 
**1.4: Storage**
 
This room contains a number of barrels of water and dilute wine, see room 1.3 for effects. There is also an entryway to the central spiral staircase ascending upward in this room.
 
**Level 2: Living Quarters**
 
This is Aelech's living quarters, such as they are.
 
**2.1: Main hall**
 
The staircase from below opens into a main hall, that looks a bit more solid and lived in than the storage area. The main hall has a central table with a few chairs, some pewter dishes sitting out, and a fireplace.
 
The stairs continue up here.
 
**2.2: Kitchens**
 
The food here seems to be of a somewhat higher quality than the food below, but if anyone eats it it crumbles to dust in their mouths, and they need to make a DC 14 CON save or suffer 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned for next 1 hour.
 
**2.3: Library**
 
This is a small library containing a few books and crucial references brought over by Aelech from the Shadowfell. There are maybe 10 books here, mostly chained to shelves. All the books have a similar look: dark covers (gray or black), thick pages, sometimes with blood stains. They are big and heavy - the smallest is 2 lb and most are 5 lb.
 
If party investigates, the following happens:  
-all books are written in Shadowkar, the Shadowfell equivalent of Sylvan. Anyone who speaks Sylvan can try to decipher text with a DC 12 Intelligence check.
 
-six books are "normal" books on necromancy and rituals to create undead  
-one book is cursed: if you start to read it, it begins to draw you in, deeper and deeper, you can't stop reading, and as you read the language begins to make more and more sense; need to succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom save or become obsessed with book, feel it is something you can't quite understand but if you just keep reading important new insights will be yours. Cannot part with the book (as a cursed item), and will feel an itch to read it at all times (can allow DC 10 Wisdom save to resist). Once you have read the book for 72 hours in total, make a DC 15 Wisdom save. On failure, the book begins to take over your mind (first as charm person, eventually as possession). The book wants to get back to the Shadowfell and be returned to its "home". If you succeed on the initial save, recognize the book is deeply evil; if keep reading for 72 hours, can learn the ritual of shadow undead creation, but at this point need to make a DC 18 Wisdom save or become obsessed with carrying out the ritual.  
-one book is a spellbooks, containing Aelech's spells; this is trapped with a glyph of warding; opening the spellbook triggers the _Darkness_ (except with duration of 1 hour) spell centered on the book itself; in addition, everyone in the darkness must make a Wisdom save (DC 13) or suffer the effects of the _Confusion_ spell for 1 round, and echoing laughter alerts the tower to the party's presence.  
-one book is a magical book that, if read for 72 hours, allows the reader to learn Shadowkar, the language of the Shadowfell.  
**-**one book functions as a scroll, with one casting each of _Animate Dead_, _Magic Circle,_ and _Darkness_.
 
There is also a small chest in the library containing expensive material components for spells: a collection of diamonds, black pearls, and onyx worth 1200 gp \<also magic item(s)?\> This chest is locked; Aelech wears the key.
 
Scattered around library are also more notes and papers, written in Shadowkar, describing the needs for the undead ritual.
 
**2.4: Bedchamber**
 
This is a spartan bedchamber with a small bed and a single table and chair. There is little to find here, Aelech is not interested in treasure per se, all his valuable stuff is in the library or on his person.
 
**Level 3: Domain of Nugruk**
 
The third level of the tower is the center of the necromantic enterprise, and the domain of Nugruk.
 
**3.1: Ritual Chamber**
 
This is a chamber used to create undead by Aelech. Each ritual circle represents runes etched in blood on the ground.
 
**3.2: Entryway for bridge**
 
This is Nugruk's chamber, and also the defense of the bridge. Nugruk and two skeleton lieutenants are here -- will attack when party is on the bridge, using his long distance eldritch blast.
 
**4: Shadowfell Portal and Energy Source**  
**￼**This is the portal to the Shadowfell through which the energy to power the ritual is pulled. Six pillars of shadow stand around the room, each one vibrating with energy. The wraithlord and his lieutenant stand guard here.
 
Each pillar of shadow can be destroyed by dealing 15 points of radiant damage to it (AC 13) (maybe make more complicated -- they fight back as they start to be destroyed, upping the tension somehow?)
 
**5: Location of Undead Ritual**
 
Aelech himself, with some low-level shadow/skeleton/etc allies, is on top of the tower. If the party has not destroyed the shadowfell portal, he may be casting the ritual. If portal has been destroyed, will be angry and trying to use the echoing energy of the destruction of the portal to summon a Sorrowsworn, but will quickly stop and attack party coming up to roof.
