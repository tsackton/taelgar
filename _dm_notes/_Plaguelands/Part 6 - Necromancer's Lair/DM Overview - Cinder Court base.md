**Overview:**
 
The Cinder Court base has about 80 hobgoblins at it, organized into 2 banners of 40 each, which are further split into 5 blades of 8 warriors. Each blade consists of a leader, a lieutenant, and 6 regular troops. In addition, each banner has a commander and a sub-commanders, and the entire hierarchy is led by a general.
 
At any one time, four blades are on external patrol, so typically around 50 hobgoblins are in the base (six blades). Of the external patrol blades, two are mounted on wargs, one is the one the party encountered, and one is similar to the encounter blade. Each blade is on duty for 16 hours a day, and rests/eats for 8, so that means at any one time, four blades are on duty in base.
 
Three blades have responsibility for guarding the perimeter of the base. One blade patrols on foot from tower to tower, making a complete circuit approximately once per hour. One blade guards the western towers (green dot), one blade guards the eastern towers (blue dot). Each tower has two hobgoblins stationed at it at all times.
 
The remaining blade on duty is stationed (2 per tower) in the interior towers, overlooking the prisoners.
 
The two off duty blades will typically be found in the barracks or the main hall.
 
This schedule is maintained for 24 hours a day, so the locations of hobgoblins don't change much through the day.
 
**Approach**
 
For about 100' in all directions out from the gash in the ground where the base is built, the ground is dead and cleared.
 
The blade on patrol, which consists of 5 hobgoblins, 2 hobgoblin iron shadows, and 1 hobgoblin captain, circles the edge of the forest.
 
When they approach, roll 1d6:  
1: patrol is directly in front of them  
2: patrol has just left sector they are approaching, and won't be back for an hour  
3: patrol is approaching sector, will arrive in 10 minutes  
4-6: patrol is on other side of ravine, will arrive in ~30 minutes
 
**Layout, In the Ravine**
 
The base itself is set in a deep gash in the ground, with sharp, blasted walls, glass-smooth in places. In the center of a gash, a low wall protects a deeper pit, out of which rises a shadowy tower, which seems to shimmer and shift slightly, and casts a pall over the entire area.
 
**1A: External watch towers**
 
Watchtower blades are: 1 captain, 1 devastator, 2 iron shadows, 4 hobgoblins
 
Each watchtower consists of a 15' x 15' wooden structure that climbs 20' above the ground to a platform. Access is via a rickety wooden ladder. The platform is roofed and protected by sharped log wall, and guarded by two hobgoblins.
 
Roll randomly to determine who the hobgoblins are (1d4)  
1: Hobgoblin devastator + hobgoblin  
2: Hobgoblin captain + hobgoblin  
3: Two hobgoblin iron shadows  
4: Two hobgoblins
 
If they scout multiple towers, no rerolls allowed on each side of ravine (make note of who is in each tower).
 
If party is spotted from a tower, each is equipped with a gong that can be sounded to raise the alarm, and hobgoblins in tower will fire ranged weapons. Can also push ladder down if they try to climb.
 
After alarm is sounded, patrol will move at speed towards alarmed tower. Off duty blades will move to reinforce towers and external patrol (one joining external patrol moving towards alarm, second adding to each tower defense). Guards in other towers will not move.
 
Rope ladders from 1B towers will be destroyed once off duty patrols ascend.
 
Off duty blade 1 will be active in 10 minutes, off duty blade 2 in 20 minutes.  
Patrol will arrive in 5-15 minutes depending on distance.
 
**1B: External watch towers with stairs**
 
These are identical to 1A, except the platform extends over the edge of the cliff, and a rope netting drops 70' to the ground below. It takes a solid minute to cut the rope netting off its attachments.
 
The commander of the banner, and one sub-captain (both hobgoblin captains, one with extra hp and str) are with the western stair tower.
 
**1C: Internal watch towers**
 
The internal watch towers are constructed like the external ones, except they look inward to the low wall, the pit, and the shadowy tower.
 
Roll randomly to determine who the hobgoblins are (1d4)  
1-2: Hobgoblin devastator + hobgoblin  
3: Hobgoblin captain + hobgoblin  
4: Two hobgoblins
 
**2: Barracks / tents**
 
Loose collections of tents in various states of repair form the barracks and sleeping quarters of the blades. At any one time, 1 blade is sleeping/resting, in the southernmost barracks area (rest are empty).
 
This blade consists of 1 hobgoblin captain, 2 hobgoblin iron shadows, and 5 hobgoblins.
 
The tents are orderly and spartan, with few markings of status and no treasure. This is an operation on war footing, and the hobgoblins are too well trained and too loyal to keep spoils of war for themselves.
 
**3A: Main Hall**
 
A hastily constructed wooden hall stands here, serving as a mess hall, a command center, and a temple. Inside, several long tables stand. Inside, the 2nd off duty banner can be found eating, unless they are training on the proving grounds outside.
 
This blade consists of 1 hobgoblin captain and 7 hobgoblins, one of whom has 3x normal hit points. The commander of the banner (hobgoblin captain with extra hp and str) is with this blade at the moment.
 
This is also the storeroom - large quantities of thin gruel for the prisoners, dried meat and hard bread for the troops.
 
**3B: Proving Ground**
 
A square of cleared dirt, with benches set up to allow for spectators, serves as the main training and proving ground of the base. The off duty blade may be training here if it is daytime.
 
**4: Officer's quarters**
 
These are larger and fancier tents. The tent marked (A) is the quarters of the commander of the base (a hobgoblin warlord). To determine the commander's location, roll 1d6:
 
1-2: in the mess hall or proving grounds  
3-4: patrolling with the blade on patrol around the perimeter  
5-6: in his quarters
 
His quarters contain maps and battle plans, as well as information about the ritual, timing wise, and notes on the care and keeping of the prisoners.
 
In one corner is a small, locked chest, which contains 324 gp, 1176 sp, 5634 cp, and a pouch of fourteen small gems worth 25 gp each.
 
The hobgoblin warlord carries two potions of greater healing, and a potion of dragon's breath on him.
 
The tent marked (B) is divided into two bunks, and is the space for the commanders of the banners. They are empty.
 
**5: Animal pens**
 
This is the warg pen. Most of the animals are gone at the moment, but 6 worgs remain in the pen. The animals are tended by a bugbear chief.
 
This area is chaotic and noisy, and the remains of who knows what last meal are scattered about.
 
**6: Armory**
 
Spare weapons and ammo is kept here in two makeshift shacks, one of which has an outdoor forge used to repair weapons and armor. One hobgoblin sub-commander (captain stats) is here.
 
**7: Pits of Despair**
 
A low wall surrounds a pit that drops about 25' to the ground. Mists cover the ground, and every now and then you can see, as the mists stir, gaunt humans, most with tendrils of mist draped over them, almost as if they are connected to the mist. They seem to be listless, not moving much, just sitting. No obvious restraints bind them, other than the misty tendrils of shadow. There are hundreds people packed into this space. There are also caves carved out of the side of the walls, crammed with more people. In total about 600 people are trapped here.
 
These are prisoners from Darkwood, from [[Tygate]], from other small isolated settlements in southern Addermarch. They are being held here for the ritual, which will turn them all into ghouls, ghasts, or zombies, creating a deadly undead armor.
 
The mists are the essence of the Shadowfell, keeping them docile and depressed. The first time you enter the mists, and every hour after you. spend in the mists, you must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you start to become lethargic (disdvantage on ability checks, stop recognizing the mists as a threat, movement speed is halved), and must make another saving throw every 24 hours. After three total failures (including the first one), you lose the will to do anything at all as the world takes on a gray pallor. If you succeed the first saving throw, you suffer no ill effects, but must continue to make a saving throw every hour until you leave the mists or fail.
 
Destroying the connection to the Shadowfell removes the effect instantly; otherwise, a lesser restoration or similar works.
 
Looking down into the pits will reveal a mass of people, just lying there, not moving or anything. They cannot be shaken awake or made to care, except by destroying source of tendrils, or by lesser restoration per person.
 
They are guarded by 10 skulks, who take what little pleasure they can in inflicting pain and seeing who can still feel it. Anyone living descending into the pit will draw their attention.
 
**8: Tower of the Dead**
 
The tower of the dead looms out of the central pit. It can be reached either through a doorway at the base, or through a bridge to the a doorway on the third floor, coming into room 3.2.
 
The doorway at the bottom of the pit is not trapped or locked, but requires a mist check as entering the mist is necessary.
 
The bridge is trapped. Half way across, a 10' section is an illusion. Detectable with detect magic, or a DC 19 Intelligence (Perception) check. Otherwise, a DC 18 Dex save to avoid falling. If fall, take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and fall into mists. Only first person subject to trap, but also need to figure out how to cross.
