## Adderfell, the Earl, and the Cinder Court (Adderfell #1)
 
### Synopsis

Party arrived in Adderfell ([Adderfell Approach](Adderfell%20Approach.md)), said goodbye to Eva and Betram, then visited Earl ([Meeting Eofric](Meeting%20Eofric.md)). Afterward the party got rooms at [The Brass Thorn](The%20Brass%20Thorn.md), where they talked to [Ellyn](Ellyn.md) and heard some [rumors](City%20Scenes.md) before heading to bed. In the middle of the night, they were attacked and defeated the [Shadow Assassins](Shadow%20Assassins.md), in part by summoning a unicorn with a wild magic surge. In the morning they went shopping at the market, where they met [Simi](Simi.md) and made plans to meet him at his shop/home in the evening. At that point. [Owlbear Market Attack](Owlbear%20Market%20Attack.md) happened, and they followed the tracks of the spy to the [Cinder Court Hideout](Cinder%20Court%20Hideout.md), where they started to explore, driving off two bone crabs and capturing/killing thugs, plus rescuing Kave.
 
### Developments

- Summoning a unicorn during the shadow fey attack will throw the dark fey into confusion, wondering why the party has the protection of such powerful entities. Next time they will not send assassins but instead try to send a spy of some kind [need to develop this, and also a mechanism for how the shadow fey tracking works and how Meriele can discover / remove it
- Defeating the owlbear at the market in a public and dramatic way will earn the PCs, especially Thardin, some local renown. Rumors of them will spread around town

## (Adderfell #2)
 
### Synopsis

They left the Cinder Court hideout with prisoners, who made a ruckus, one escaping. They brought captives to the city guard, who quickly sent guards to investigate. Party decided to return with guards, fighting their way through Cinder Court members who were set up and ready for an intrusion, eventually killing 3 and capturing 3. One of the Cinder Court members was able to release a second owlbear before getting captured, which ran up the passageway to the town, and was eventually caught and killed by the party. After discovering the Earl was out (and late returning), the party went to Captain Raffian, who had just summoned Lady Zivkara, a wizard, after learning from Kave that the Cinder Court was trying to open a portal somewhere. Lady Zivkara has just arrived, and said we must deal with this as soon as possible.
 
### Developments

- Earl's absence: seems mysterious and bad, but actually a horse just went lame and travel was slow.
- The portal area remains protected by the animated cloak, but everyone else has left. When actually entering the area, the black essence will trigger a vision and Wisdom saving throw for Evendur; similar to dream.
- This is not exactly a portal, but a place where the boundary between the Shadow Realm and the real world is relaxed, which will let the Shadow realm to leak across. The Cinder Court has made this magically stronger by concentrating the black stuff. The portal / weak spot can be destroyed by sunlight
