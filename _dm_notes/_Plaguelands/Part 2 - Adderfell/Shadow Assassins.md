Dramatic question here: “Can the shadow attackers capture the party?”   
[these are literally assassins sent to capture them and bring them to the dark Fey realm; while they may flee they won’t surrender]
 
*Backstory issue: really need to figure out why exactly the dark Fey are chasing the PCs, and what the connection is with the Cinder Court and the Hobgoblin army and the Darkwood attackers.*  
In any case, this is a combat.*
 
Combat is three **shadows** and one **dread warrior**; the dread warrior appears after 3 rounds of combat.
 
**XP: 250 if they defeat attackers; 125 XP if they survive but need to be rescued**
