## Overview

In the morning of the day after the party arrives in Adderfell, an **owlbear** is released by the Cinder Court to attack the market. It has been trained and tortured to be violent and angry and mindless. It’s tactics are mindless - it will charge through market destroying stuff, and retaliate against the first thing to damage it. 
 
If it is reduced to 15 or fewer HP, it makes a DC 10 wisdom saving; if successful will come to its senses a little and try to flee if it can, away from Cinder Court base. 
 
A Cinder Court cultist has been sent to observe and report back; she will not be involved in combat. If the owlbear looks like it will be defeated, she will attempt to flee; allow everyone a DC 12 perception check to notice. 
 
Before combat starts, anyone searching the market can find her with a perception check contested with her stealth (she has stats of **spy**).
 
## Developments

The party succeeded in defeating the owlbear, and also found the spy and tracked her to the Cinder Court hideout.
 
After defeating the owlbear and while Evendur and Meriele were searching for the spy, Thardin was praised by the town and got the people to stop panicking, so will have developed some local reputation.
