The party is led to [Earl Eofric](Earl%20Eofric.md) after convincing the guards they have legitimate business (if they show letter of introduction from Oswyn, this does not require an ability check; otherwise, a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) roll required).
 
_Earl Eofric is a well-muscled man with chestnut brown hair, sharp features, and battle scars, most notably a broken nose that never healed properly, wearing a polished chain shirt under a well-made cloak. He is scowling at a guard when you come in, barking at him “We need more patrols_ **inside** _the walls as well! Get it done!” He turns to you, frowning, and says: “Yes? I am told you have a letter from my man Oswyn?”__￼_  
For this encounter, he wants information and aid, without giving much or anything away from PCs. The letter gets them an audience but he is not quick to trust. The two things Earl Eofric can offer are 1) a quest (go to Darkwood Keep and figure out what’s up) and 2) information about Cinder Court, Darkwood Keep, and the larger situation in this area.
 
If all the players care about is the quest, this will be quick. The Earl really wants to send someone he can basically trust (at least not to be working for Cinder Court) but who he deems expendable to bring a news back from Darkwood Keep. He will offer them money if needed or if they seem reluctant, but will start by offering them thanks/reputation/status. He will not, however, offer them much in the way of information beyond what is crucial for the task (which he asks the players to return in the morning to receive at the council meeting). If the players give him the letter from the hobgoblin messenger he will be appreciative (reduce doesn’t trust party objection by 1). 
 
If the players want to get information from the Earl, they will need to overcome his objections to sharing information. Now this becomes an encounter, with a dramatic question (“Can the players learn what they want to learn from the Earl?”). This is going to be time-limited, as the Earl is a busy man. Give the party 3 rolls / attempts to influence him. For each successful check that either creates an incentive for him to share information or reduces an objection to sharing information, mark +1. The total after 3 checks determines how much info they get. All checks are DC 12 baseline, adjusted +/- 3 depending on reasonableness and how closely they address problems. Succeeding by 5 or more counts as two successes (mark +2).
 
Be blunt about his objections -- if they ask for information, he says: “_I’ll be blunt. You are a troop of unknowns I’ve never heard of before, showing up at my keep and demanding to be let into my confidence about a secret cult. Why should I trust you to begin with, and how do I know you are not going to betray me, or get captured and spill my secrets to save your skins?”_
 
Objections:  
1) Has not heard of party before -- willing to send them into danger but doesn’t want to share a lot of information until assured of their skill, in case of capture  
2) Slow to trust strangers -- why should he trust them?
 
If party shares letter from hobgoblins, start at +1. Otherwise, start at 0.
 
Total:  
0-1: will not share additional information  
2: reveals information about Adderfell, increase in crime and that there have been some attacks  
3: reveals suspicion that Cinder Court is behind increase in crime, and based out of old town area  
4: reveals most of what he knows about Cinder Court:   
i) mixed group of hobgoblins (mostly raiding outside of towns) and humans (active across area)  
ii) leader in this area is a hobgoblin based in the forest -- seem to be using forest as a raiding base  
iii) there is definitely a mystical connection between shadow realm and Cinder Court, although exactly what they don’t quite know  
iv) also knows everything from notes that Bertram knows  
5+: reveals most of what he knows, and invites party to join tomorrow’s council meeting to discuss what is to be done.  
(all the above, plus some info about general military situation in area: scouts have reported hobgoblin army massing in the southeast, but many don’t return; skeletons were seen around the Darkwood but unclear if this is connected; Darkwood is part of a string of keeps guarding the southern border of Addermarch. 
 
**Experience points: 125 if they get information from Earl, extra 175 if they get invited to council meeting, 0 if they just get the quest and are told to come back tomorrow.**
