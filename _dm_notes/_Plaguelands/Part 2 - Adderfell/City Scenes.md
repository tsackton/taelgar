## The Brass Thorn
 
After talking to Earl Eofric, party found rooms at [The Brass Thorn](The%20Brass%20Thorn.md). Heard some rumors, including:
 
(2) A monster lives under the old city and comes out at night to eat people  
(5) I came to Adderfell because I thought the walls would keep my family safe but now I don’t know, no where seems safe. It’s getting worse. Something has to be done. 
 
# Rumors Around Town
 
If the party is in a place with people gathered and wants to ask around for information, roll 1d6 and give them a rumor. This doesn't require a skill check.
 
(1) People have been disappearing in the night; don’t walk around the market district after dark  
(2) A monster lives under the old city and comes out at night to eat people (SORT OF FALSE)  
(3) The sign of the Cinder Court was left behind with two dead merchants a few days ago in the food market outside the walls  
(4) One of the merchant houses must be behind this trouble, they are always stirring up trouble and where are these people getting money and supplies? (FALSE)  
(5) I came to Adderfell because I thought the walls would keep my family safe but now I don’t know, no where seems safe. It’s getting worse. Something has to be done.   
(6) I’ve seen people sneaking around the old warehouse east of the plaza market. I wouldn’t go that way if I were you. The whole area east of the plaza is dangerous these days.
