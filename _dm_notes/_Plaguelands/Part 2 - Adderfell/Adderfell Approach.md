The approach to [Adderfell](Gazetteer/Greater%20Sembara/Addermarch/Adderfell.md) on the road is uneventful:
 
_You approach Adderfell as the sun sinks low in the sky, maybe an hour before sunset. For the past several hours you’ve been traveling through a rich land of orchards, cows, and fields; despite the obvious agricultural bounty you see few people on the roads or in the fields._ 
 
_Adderfell is set on the edge of a small lake, below a towering waterfall. The most striking feature of the town, besides the stone walls obviously kept in good repair, is a cliff rising from the edge of the lake with a keep on top of it. Outside the walls and below the keep on the lake shore, there is a stretch of reeds, willows, and cattails, among which you can see a glimpse of some wooden huts on raised piers. Along the walls as you approach, you can also see a number of wood and thatch buildings that have grown up near the town, many of which look pretty run down._ 
 
_The ancient road you are following leads to the main gates of the walls._ 
 
_What do you want to do?_
 
[Eva](Eva.md) and [Bertram](Bertram.md) will stay with a friend in the area outside the walls, with a plan to sell their wares over the next couple of days and then return with a cousin and possibly hired guards. While they have nothing to pay you with, they tell you if you are ever in [Dunwick](Gazetteer/Greater%20Sembara/Addermarch/Dunwick.md) again to look them up and you’ll always have a place to stay.
