## Developments
 
- After being alerted to being discovered, Cinder Court put in motion their plan to pull the substance of the Shadow Realm into this world, but also set some defenses against intruders: two bandits watching the well entrance, and four cultists tasked with releasing owlbear if anyone comes to distract from discovery. The remaining members of Cinder Court (one **spy**, two **cultists**, one **thug**) have escaped.
- **Cult fanatic** and her familiar (a **quasit**) are in room 7, where the **empty cloak** (below) also is waiting. When the party enters, the cult fanatic is doing something with the black liquid, and sends the cloak to attack. Cult fanatic is wielding a **Wand of Acid Arrow** with 7 charges, which she will also use in combat. Have her say something creepy about plot and also give a hint about stopping it.
- In Room 8, there is a dead mage (throat slit), and the potions have been taken. Arcane symbols and chains can be found in the area. This mage was captured and helping with the enchantments of the shadow liquid, against his wishes
- Room 6 is as described (see note below re: black liquid), but mushrooms do psychic not poison damage, if a Wisdom save is failed.

## The Black Liquid (Shadow Liquid)

The black liquid flowing out of the statue is a physical manifestation of the shadow realm. Touching it causes 1d6 psychic damage on a failed Wisdom save.
 
In addition, prolonged contact (more than ~5 minutes, or breathing the vapors) confers the condition **Shadow Nightmares** on a failed Wisdom saving throw (DC 12). Someone who is affected by shadow nightmares must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) each time they sleep. If they fail, they suffer terrible nightmares, do not gain the benefit of a long rest, take 1d6 psychic damage, and gain one level of exhaustion. Two successful saves in a row remove this condition, which can also be cured by a _remove curse_ or a _lesser restoration_.

## Cinder Court plot

The pool of black liquid in room 6 (mushroom room) is bubbling and steaming, sending billowing columns of black steam up into vents in the ceiling. This starts to spread through the town, causing an epidemic of shadow nightmares, although only at night. Depending on the wind, the black mist will spread more or less distance each night, but generally will stay in the old town and
 
The trap needs several things to continue functioning:

1. The black liquid itself. While this cannot be destroyed by normal means, it can be destroyed by direct sunlight. Exposing this room and the next to direct sunlight would permanently end the connection to the Shadow Realm. Also let Sunsword have some effect.
2. The vents allowing the steam and mist to reach the town. These are carefully constructed and have several redundant paths, so it would take some work to seal them all off, but could be done. This would only temporarily end threat of course as liquid / Shadow Realm would remain.
3. The black liquid requires a magical source of energy to bubble and steam - dispelling this would also end the trap, although again the Shadow Realm connection would remain.
 
Because it is now after sunset, some effect is unavoidable; if party finds a way to stop the mechanism after dealing with shadow cultist, 2d6 x 2 people in this part of town will be affected by Shadow Nightmares.
 
If they do not stop it during the evening, for each night it is in effect, 1d100 + 20 people are affected each night.
 
Assume that ~1/4th of people affected die from exhaustion, rest eventually recover.
 
After curse has been running for a week without being stopped, (1d100 + 20)/4 people die each morning (~15-20 people).
 
If PCs don't do anything, assume that curse is removed in 10 days by Lady Zivkara et al; in the end about 700 people (half the town) will be affected, and about 150 people will die. Mostly will affect people in old town, trading area, and craft area; ironically not the poorer area of town outside the walls.
