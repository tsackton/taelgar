_Finding the entrance:_   
If the party follows the Cinder Court cultist from the market attack, she will lead them here. They can either charge in or sneak in.
 
If they capture the Cinder Court cultist:

- She joined Cinder Court mostly out of fear, and to protect her family (they have always lived near plaza and this is becoming Cinder Court territory)
- She will not talk unless she can be convinced that her parents and younger brother are not in danger and will not face reprisals from the Cinder Court
- An easy check (DC 10) will reveal her objection; a medium (DC 15) or hard (DC 20) check will remove it depending on convincingness
- If objection is removed, she will reveal: 
    1. Cinder Court is planning something big in Adderfell; she doesn’t know what but they have an alchemist captive who has been working on something against his will
    2. Their is a base under the old town, starting from an ancient well in a warehouse east of the market plaza
    3. There are only about 10 Cinder Court members in all of Adderfell; another small group (4) was sent out on a secret mission a few days ago￼

If the party doesn’t follow the Cinder Court cultist, and doesn’t capture her, they probably won’t find the base. However, it is not impossible. If they follow the rumors to the warehouse, they can find the footsteps around an old well with a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception). If they are specifically investigating well, a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation | Perception) check will reveal handholds, foot traffic indicating an entrance to something.
 
Failing to catch the rumor, general exploration of the area east of the market (direction attack came from) will reveal a small mark of the Cinder Court on the warehouse with a DC 15 Wisdom (perception) check; can be made with advantage if they are specifically looking for Cinder Court marks / signs. 
 
They can also attempt to follow tracks of monster with a DC 13 Wisdom (survival) check, which will lead to back entrance near docks (tunnel that goes into area 12 of the map). 
 
Assuming they find entrance, they’ll either be at beginning or area 12. Run dungeon as modified
