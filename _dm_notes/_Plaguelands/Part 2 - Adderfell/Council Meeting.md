The next morning, a guard finds the party at breakfast at the Brass Thorn and requests their presence at the Earl's manor:
 
_You follow the guard through the winding streets of Adderfell, up the long and winding climb to the Earl's manor, where you are quickly ushered into the Earl’s council rooms, and seemingly into the middle of an argument. The Earl is seated before you in a ornate carved chair; surrounding him are four other people. A tall, long-limbed human woman with shoulder length red hair, looking troubled; a pot-bellied older man wearing plain white robes; a man about the same age as the Earl, but balding and with a softer, rounder face; and a short, wiry woman of indeterminate age wearing travel stained clothing. As you enter, an argument between the two women grinds to a halt, the red-haired one saying "But the defense of our people must be our first priority, no matter what the letter says!" She trails off, and all eyes turn to you._
 
**[modify as needed based on outcome of Cinder Court hideout encounters]**
 
_The Earl is the first to speak, saying, "Welcome, friends! We are grateful indeed for your bravery yesterday. Without your aid we may not have discovered the Cinder Court in our midst in time, and while we mourn the lost of life it surely would have been greater without your aid. Let me introduce my advisors: Lady Zivkara, Mistress of Letters; Lady Ellys; Lord Wisym; and Elder Anders."_
 
_"We have discussed the letter you recovered from hobgoblins, and your offer to help by traveling to Deepwood Keep. A rider has arrived from the Keep this morning, and we expect news shortly, which will be in your interest to here if you still intend to aid us in discovering whatever is behind the events there."_
 
_"While we are waiting, the council has some questions for you."_
 
**[Improve a few questions and let the party talk a bit; when things start to drag, introduce the rider].**
 
_In the middle of a sentence, the door bangs open again, and two guards usher in a man dressed in riding cloths, travel-stained and weary. The Earl beckons him forward, and says "Speak, man."_
 
_The rider begins: "Lord Earl, honored council. I have ridden hard from Darkwood Keep. Several weeks ago, we were ambushed and surrounded by a large force of hobgoblins. Much of our fighting force had been out on an investigation of rumors in the Darkwood itself, and it was all we could do to prevent a rout. We attempted to send messengers, but they must have been caught and slain on the road. Just two days ago, the main force of the Keep returned and we were able to coordinate an attack to break the siege. I rode as fast and hard as I could to warn you that while the Keep is safe and the Darkwood quiet, the splintered remains of the army are fleeing in all directions and many must be coming north. Addermarch must prepare for these raiders, Lord Earl. I have seen bands moving as I traveled north to you and our farms and fields will not survive this unless we prepare. Please, Lord, listen to me."_
 
_With that, he bows and steps aside, as an immediate commotion breaks out in the council._
 
**[Improv some argument, get party engaged; if party brings up the letter and the message they found, have the council, especially Lady Ellys -- who is the most suspicious -- echo it. Eventually conclusion should be reached that something is not right and Elder Anders will cast Zone of Truth and request everyone step inside]**
 
_As the discussion continues, the Earl turns to Elder Anders and says, frowning: "We must get to the bottom of this; someone is hiding something. Please ask the gods to bring us the truth of this matter."_
 
_Elder Anders raises his holy symbol and mutters a brief prayer to the Father, and points at a spot on the floor. A glowing white energy ripples across the floor, and Anders says: "Everyone, step inside the circle. It will compel you to tell the truth."_
 
**[Improv some brief interrogation; rider will become increasingly nervous -- can be detected on a Wisdom [insight | arcana] check, but try to ride it out. At some point a seemingly innocent question like "where were you born?" will be asked and the doppleganger will attack. He will use his surprise round to attack Thardin, and then will shapechange into one of the PCs. Require a intelligence check (arcana, investigation, perception all probably relevant skills) to be able to keep track of the real Thardin. If wounded seriously, will attempt to flee and turn into a guard as soon as outside the doors -- at which point it will be much harder to track, although Lady Zivkara knows Detect Thoughts. During this interrogation, perhaps figure out some way for Meriele modified memory to come up]**
 
**[doppleganger actions in combat will be 1) attack, 2) polymorph, 3) read thoughts of target; once it has read thoughts it will be very difficult to tell apart by questioning as it will be easy for doppleganger to track answers. After this point will attempt to flee as above]**
 
**[in combat give party 2 rounds — Earl will shout for guards, other council members will stand and move into position, maybe cast a spell or two — this shouldn’t be a hard combat, just surprising]**
 
**[after combat, council will be agreed that the Darkwood must be investigated]**
 
Lady Zivkara
 
Despite her interest in magic and concern, her first priority is to her adopted home and she will argue for shoring up defenses, especially after news of Cinder Court base in Adderfell; however, news of attacks on party at night (shadows, shadow mastiffs, etc), and especially news of Evendur’s dream, will change her mind. If she hears these things she will want the party to come to her tower to discuss further.
 
Lady Ellys
 
She is very much in favor of pushing forward to Darkwood Keep and learning what is going on as soon as possible, no matter the cost to Adderfell. She will send her aide on this mission with party. 
 
[Lord Wisym](Lord%20Wisym.md)
 
He will not speak much, leaving the debate to others, but will support the Earl as needed
 
[Elder Anders](Elder%20Anders.md)
 
He is concerned with the safety and protection of travelers, peasants, and everyone who is under the watchful eye of the Eightfold Divine. Will bring up duty a lot.
