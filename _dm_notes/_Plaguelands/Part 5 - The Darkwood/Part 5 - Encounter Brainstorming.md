A few notes/ideas:
 
How will party find necromancer lair? Clues in keep will pretty much direct them to Darkwood itself.

1. One missing piece they may find is the ranger scout Efrin, who has a sending stone keyed to one in the commander's chest. She may know a lot.
2. In the Darkwood, if they talk to the Ettercaps they could learn where the necromancer lair is. Ettercaps and spiders, while generally interested in food, won't attack for no reason and generally will avoid heavily armored and powerful-looking parties, preferring easier prey. Thus, opportunity to discuss. Ettercaps of course know where big disturbances in the Darkwood are.
3. Necromancer patrols: because ettercaps and spiders will often take pot shots at easy prey like the necromancer's captives and base, patrols of hobgoblins and/or skeleton soldiers are common; capturing one or retracing its path could lead to base (although tracking v. difficult as terrain shifts)
4. Dark Fey will come into play again. The Shadowfey lost track of them in Adderfell, but will likely pick up the trail again in the Darkwood. They could have maps or information leading to Necromancer's lair.
5. Trails: while it will be difficult there should be some physical clues findable with good luck.
 
How to structure encounters?
 
The nature of the Darkwood means there should be only a few permanent locations. These would include:

1. Necromancer's Lair
2. Cinder Cult watch outpost
3. Spider lair
4. Some kind of shadow fey lair
 
Everything except Necromancer's Lair should occur in 2-3 spots, with slight variations on layout and encounters in each.
 
In addition, need a good long list of possible 'tension pool' encounters, and a good way to roll (calculate probabilities, want 3-5 'random' encounters per day, which won't all be combats necessarily). Probably want something like 20 things, of which maybe half are possible combats, another 5 are traps/hazards, and 5 are mysterious/spooky. Also have a set of 6 possible discoveries, that don't need to be fully fleshed out but are improv prompts.
   

Mechanically, how should Darkwood play out? Boring/frustrating for them to have no idea where to go, but also want Darkwood to be a complex environment that has character/personality.
 
Some ideas:

1. Initially trail should be relatively easy to follow, but destination a little unclear
2. As they travel deeper into woods, trails should become obscure, but destination should be clearer
3. Challenge shifts from following trail to finding some way to get to a specific location
 
Flavor/character should be provided by a series of random encounters.

**Basic Chart Outline**  
1: generic encounter - Cinder Court patrol (hobgoblins or skeletons)  
2: generic encounter - mischievous fey, but potentially helpful  
3: generic encounter - malevolent fey, blights, or related  
4: generic encounter - aberration/monstrosity/beast of the forest  
5-10: roll on area encounter list  
11: generic obstacle - corrupting influence, poisonous air, enchanted vines, thieving fey, something that attacks resources (hp, exhaustion, food, water)  
12: generic obstacle - shifting path, shifting trees, shifting mists/fog, something that obscures trail/direction and makes it harder to figure out where to go next, more likely to get lost/delayed  
13-16: roll on area obstacle list  
17: spooky/mysterious - a magical/haunted/enchanted tree/plants  
18: spooky/mysterious - Feywild/Shadowell connection, guarded by stone circle or not  
19: spooky/mysterious - noises/sounds hinting at past battles, mysterious beasts, or something else, some kind of other illusion/vision of the past  
20: spooky/mysterious -

**Encounters**
 
_Necromancer patrol:_  
1: Hobgoblin captain or devastator, 1d4+3 hobgoblins  
2: 1d2+1 hobgoblin iron shadows  
3: skeleton patrol: 1 captain or lieutenant plus skeletons

Spiders/ettercaps; shadow mastiff; displacer beast; basilik; owlbear; giant elk or similar; chimera; hydra
 
_Area Encounters:_
 
Outer woods: generally weaker monsters, where spiders/ettercaps have largely been driven, fewer fey and tending towards trickster fey; patrols rare
 
Inner woods: stronger monsters, stronger fey, more patrols
 
Necromancer zone: many many patrols, guards, etc; some strategic monsters/lairs; some fey incursions
