Current situation:
 
Dec 14th morning, just finished long rest  
Seven days until ritual
 
_You awake after a fitful night of sleep in the forest. Only two days ago, you were in the Darkwood Keep, making plans with Maglor and the chapel priest Jaufri to spread the word about the strange events happening in the Darkwood. Now, that seems a distant memory as the looming, oppressive presence of the Darkwood grows stronger and more unwelcoming. Even the satyr party now feels like a distant memory after a day of hard travel, fighting off an ambush from a hunting party of displacer beasts, and the eerie mist of the river and the Will O' Wisps haunting it._
 
_As you awake and start to fix a cold breakfast, Merelie notices that the forest is eerily silent. The rushing sounds of the river before are gone, clouds hang low over the sky, and the cold chill of winter is seeps into your bones. Contemplating the quiet, the mental intrusion of your sending stone is a shock: a message, not from Efrin, but from Maglor._

DM notes:
 
1. The sounds of the river were a trick, caused by Will O' Wisps. Still will know direction, but cannot easily follow by sound. Traveling in sight of the river is very difficult terrain but guarantees will not get lost; otherwise may stray. Traveling on river (e.g., water walk or swan boat) would be fast and easy.
2. No news from Efrin, she is in a stupor caught in the illusion of the hill (next page). Can free her if they manage to defeat it. Need to think about time and how long until she dies, etc.
3. The area around the river is all about illusion

DM notes -- travel time
 
It is 2 1/2 days of travel by foot through difficult terrain to get to source of river, traveling at a medium pace (normally 3 miles/hour for 8 hours a day, but in this case because of difficult terrain only 10-12 miles per day). Source of river is maybe 30 miles south assuming they follow course of river, 20 miles by the crow flies
 
Ways they can speed up:  
Go straight path, not following turns: risks getting lost but cuts 1/2 day of journey  
Travel faster (water walk, throw caution to the wind)
 
Going slower:  
Encounters cause delays in 1 hour increments, three delays = 1/2 day wasted
