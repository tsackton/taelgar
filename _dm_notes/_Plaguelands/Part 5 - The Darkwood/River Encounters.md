**Encounter**
 
**[this happens once they get to source of river; Efrin is weak and wounded on hill]**
 
_The forest is generally dark and close, but up ahead you see sun shining on a rise of land that seems to have a view around._
 
If they head to hill, can get advantage on next survival roll, or reduce DC by 3 if already have advantage.
 
However, around the hill flowers grow that have a soporific scent.
 
_As you climb the trail, you come out into the sunlight for the first time since entering the forest. The forest is thinner here, and dappled light shines on late flowering yellow blossoms of witch hazel. The smell of plants reminds you of summer, and of a more peaceful time away from this darkness._
 
(CON save DC 13 to realize that something is odd about this)
 
_(failed) You find yourself walking slowly towards the sunlight, eager to rest and relax, here at the one welcoming and seemingly peaceful place you have seen in the forest. You don't know what helpful spirits guard this place, but it seems to be protected and safe, and a good place for a rest._
 
_(success) You shake your head and look around; you seem to be seeing double. The peaceful scene of blooms in winter is superimposed on a rocky hill, with only dead trees and scraggly thornbushes bearing dead flowers. The scent of decay is overwhelming. \<People who failed save\> seem to be heading towards a particularly thorny bush to lay down for a rest._
 
The illusion is tied to the smell of the flowers. Burning the thorn bushes will stop the illusion. You can also forcibly drag the affected people away, or something else creative. Anyone who leaves who failed the save will suffer one level of exhaustion, unless illusion is destroyed. Resting here does not restore HP/spell slots/etc, and instead of healing causes you to gain 1 level of exhaustion. Each day can make another CON save, if succeed will break illusion.
 
Thornbushes are fed by the decaying corpses of people who just lay down to rest and never got up
 
XP:  
500 for destroying flowers/bushes  
250 for getting people out but without destroying it  
0 if they leave Efrin / don't rescue anyone

[The following are possible encounters to pull out during the river journey. The general goal is to emphasize the creepiness / illusion-centric nature of this place, which gets even more intense as they head south.]

**Encounter**
 
_As you continue to travel south the eerie silence is shattered by the sounds of a battle. Cries and screams from what sound like humans, although speaking in a dialect of Sembaran you have not heard before. Then, suddenly, a roar of what sounds like a very large, very angry lion. The noise is coming maybe a few hundred feet on your left, away from the river._
 
[modify depending on their approach]
 
_As you approach, you can see what look like 6 Sembaran soliders in battle with a large, three-headed creature: one lion, one dragon, and one goat. As you run up, the dragon head turns, looks at you, and breaths fire. While it does not quite reach you, three soldiers fall to the ground. Roll initiative._
 
[run combat as normal; chimera damage will be reduced by 1/2 and be taken as psychic damage. It will seem to resist spells, but any melee weapon attack that hits it causes the illusion to shatter]
 
-if they dispel chimera before soldiers all killed, solders will call out faintly in a language they don't quite understand, "help us, please"
 
[if they search, depending on rolls]
 
Scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 Sembaran soldiers (long dead), some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee. Some things they can learn / find:  
-history check (DC 13) reveals these are a few hundred years old based on bits of heraldry that remain on shields and memory of the armor/weapons from battle  
-investigation check (DC 10, let everyone roll) reveals some surviving equipment:

- 64 silver pieces and 14 gp, old design
- 3 smashed potion vials, 1 intact (potion of healing)
- _Shield of the Defender_. One of the soldiers has a shield that seems to be untouched by time. Two open hands, palm out, surrounded by runes, decorate the front of the shield. This functions as a shield +1. In addition, while attuned, you can cast the _Bless_ spell once per day without expending a spell slot.
 
[after about 5 minutes, scene will reset]
 
-beginning of scene is 16 soldiers in formation, coming out of woods. Chimera in sky, lands, attacks. Battle goes poorly for soldiers, chimera wins, roars in victory, and then moves into the woods to the west.
 
[how to stop?]
 
Burying the soldiers and laying them to rest will stop the cycle.  
Also any kind of dispel magic has a chance to work, treat as a 5th level spell  
Or following chimera to its lair and destroying abandoned lair will also work - improvise something, add some minor monsters that have moved in (2 ettercaps, 3 giant spiders, make sure they seem particularly evil though)
 
XP:  
500 for stopping illusion, plus encounter XP for lair if they go that route  
250 for just avoiding it  
0 if they keep fighting chimera

**Encounter**
 
[river monsters -- if they are traveling directly along river]
 
2 chuul attack
 
[if they are traveling inland]
 
7 thornies attack

**Encounter**
 
A large moss-covered single standing stone. Searching will reveal runes, make up some history of the pre-Drankorian people who lived here. Every minute of time next to the stone is 5-30 minutes in the real world. Describe the world fading and the quiet getting deeper as they approach.
 
-sense ley lines here, Evendur can feel power being drawn to the south, amp up sense of urgency
 
-skeleton with _Cloak of the Forest_. While wearing and attuned, you are under the effects of a _Mage Armor_ spell (base AC is 13), which manifests as a faintly glowing green armor around you. In addition, you gain the ability to speak and read Sylvan and once per day, you can also cast the _Longstrider_ spell without using a spell slot.
