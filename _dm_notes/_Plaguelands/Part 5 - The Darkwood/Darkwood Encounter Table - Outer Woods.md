**Cinder Court Patrol**
 
1. **Hobgoblin iron shadows (1d3+1)** 
Scouting and exploring party, tasked with keeping an eye out for intruders and watching for spiders, fey, and other things that might take issue with the invasion of the Darkwood by the necromancer's forces. Will attempt to hide at all times -- when this is rolled, roll stealth against the party's passive perception to see if they succeed. They of course won't know if they were spotted. Presume they will spot party, but if party is sneaking, compare stealth rolls to their passive perception.
 
If not noticed, will try to follow party and see what they are up to, and ambush them at a opportune time, or at a minimum try to find out what they are up to.
   

**Mischievous Fey**
 
1. **(reroll unless day) Duskthorn Dryad.**
 
_You stumble out of the woods into a small clearing, maybe 60-70 feet across. The ground here is covered in thorny bushes, and in the middle of the clearing a large dead tree stands, wrapped in vines. On the outskirts of the clearing stand several other dead trees._
 
A Duskthorn dryad is hiding in the trees. Roll stealth vs passive perception to see if she is noticed and update description accordingly. She cannot leave her vines, but loves the flowers that grow deeper in the woods (model on Sapria -- large flowers that smell of rotting flesh). She will attempt to convince anyone entering the clearing to get one for her; using _Suggestion_ and/or _Charm Person_ as needed on whomever looks like they have the worst Wisdom save (fighter or mage types, not clerics/paladins -- so in this case will probably target Evendur or Meriele). If attacked, she will use _Invisibility_ at first opportunity, and then use her _Speak with Beasts and Plants_ once the party has gone to turn forest against them.
 
If they bring back corpse flower intact, she will reward them with information and with a eight fruits from her vine that function like a goodberry.
 
1. **(reroll unless night) Pombero.** 
Roll 1d4 to determine who is on guard (1 = Arvid, 2 = Evendur, 3 = Thardin, 4 = Meriele). Roll Pombero stealth vs passive perception, with advantage. If noticed, will first attempt to charm the person on watch; if that fails will go invisible and try to sneak away, ideally grabbing something interesting that is laying around.
 
If not noticed will attempt to steal something small and interesting (potion or treasure or something).
 7. **Band of Satyrs (1d4+3).** 
(during night): Whomever is on watch hears singing and music coming towards them. Group of satyrs wakes everyone up and tries to get them to dance the night away (lose benefit of a long rest). Lots of food, drink. If they role with it, satyrs can help them. If they want them to leave, satyrs will be annoyed but will ask them to "show them something amazing" -- will accept performance (DC 18, possibly lower if cleverly described); a particularly clever illusion; anything else clever, but simple cantrip tricks probably won't work, they are fairly savvy.
 
(during day): Come across a feast in the woods -- shimmering, magical. Satyrs grab you and drag you in, saying come party. Otherwise same as above.
 
Potentially can reward party with two vials of mead that give 10 temporary hit points to the drinker (disappear on a short or long rest).
         

**Malevolent Fey**  
 

1. **1d6+4 vine blights**
 
The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.
 
Surprise party; entangle initially to freeze in place, then start constricting and squeezing to death. Can't easily flee.
 5. **Tree Blight**
    
Looks like a dead tree. Same tactics as vine blights, really. Will attempt to ambush party, but give some hint of forest feeling creepy.

**Spiders**
 
1. **2 Ettercap and 3 Giant Spiders.** 
Ambush hunting. Use encounter here: [Pt 3 Enc - Darkwood Incursion](Pt%203%20Enc%20-%20Darkwood%20Incursion.md)**.** Passive perception 18 to notice webs; DC 15 on active search (Perception or Investigation)
 5. **1d4+3 Giant Spiders**.
    
_The forest here is growing denser, the trees drawing close around you and leaving little room to move. Suddenly, with a rush, the ground collapses beneath you!_
 
First three party members need to make DC 13 Dex saving throws or fall into cave below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall. The cave is a small spider lair -- the spiders will attack intruders, but will not chase nyone out of the cave.
 
In the cave, a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) or Int (Investigation) uncovers a recent corpse of two hobgoblins, each with 3d8 gold on them in the form of small trinkets. A DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) of Int (Investigation) uncovers much older bones of a humanoid -- totally decayed and just bones, but wrapped in a cloak that seems untouched by time, embroidered with an ancient sigil. This is a symbol of the remnant of the original people of this area, who made the stone circles -- their descendants roamed in the forests and hills of this area until the Great Wars against Cha'mutte.
 
Item is a _Cloak of the Forest Defenders._ It gives +1 to AC, gives the wearer the ability to speak, read, and understand Sylvan, and once per day you can cast the _Barkskin_ spell on yourself.

**Owlbear Lair**
 
_For the past half an hour, traveling has been easier than you expected, as the forest seems to be more open and does not hinder your passage as much in this direction. You are making good progress when suddenly, a deep, rumbling screech breaks the eerie silence of the forest ahead. Through the dappled light ahead, you see an absolutely enormous dead tree, at least 20 feet in diameter. A large hole in the base of the tree is blocked by a half-bear, half-owl creature standing on its hind legs, roaring at you._
 
If party approaches, a second owlbear will emerge from the cave and act threatening, rearing on hind legs and roaring/screeching. If party backs away, will not pursue, but will fight to the death if attacked.
 
In the hollow of the dead tree is a baby owlbear.

**Displacer Beasts**
 
2-3 Displacer beasts, on the hunt, looking for sport. Tactics: [http://themonstersknow.com/displacer-beast-tactics/](http://themonstersknow.com/displacer-beast-tactics/)
 
These displacer beasts have stealth proficiency (Stealth +4), and will attempt to attack, Disengage, hide, attack again, harassing opponents. If they get pinned down or are seriously hurt, will flee. Likely will go after horse first.

**Obstacles**
 
1. Resource draining (HP)
 
_As you travel,_ _the forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight, and vines covered in shiny green seem to reach for your legs._
 
(if they turn back and try to find a different route, make another Survival check; otherwise, this is Tangleweed -- see sidebar)
 
1. Resource draining (HP)
 
_The forest is darker here, with stands of tall trees forming a canopy blocking the light. The understory is easier to travel through, though. As you continue following the trail / heading West, you hear a rustling sound moving towards you._

These are magical army ants, they will swarm around anything living and do 2d4 piercing damage per round to each creature that is swarmed. Can swarm two creatures at once (the two in front). They can be scared away with fire and washed off with water. They are immune to piercing and slashing damage, but will suffer elemental, radiant, or necrotic damage. Allow any reasonable and creative strategy to get rid of them, but if not dealt with they will continue to feast until a creature is dead and stripped to bones.
 7. Resource draining (food)
      

At camp at night - two quicklings will try to steal food, 1d4 rations each. Will not engage if attacked, will try to flee. If escape after being damaged (perhaps not likely) will have it out for party and will try to harass them frequently.
 
If encountered during the day, will use sleight of hand (+8) to try to steal random things from saddlebags of horse, continuing until noticed.
 
Will also try to steal coins.
 
Roll stealth (+8) vs passive perception of watch/lookout to notice.
 
1. Resource draining (potential exhaustion)
 
_The forest is generally dark and close, but up ahead you see sun shining on a rise of land that seems to have a view around._
 
If they head to hill, can get advantage on next survival roll, or reduce DC by 3 if already have advantage.
 
However, around the hill flowers grow that have a soporific scent.
 
_As you climb the trail, you come out into the sunlight for the first time since entering the forest. The forest is thinner here, and dappled light shines on late flowering yellow blossoms of witch hazel. The smell of plants reminds you of summer, and of a more peaceful time away from this darkness._
 
(CON save DC 13 to realize that something is odd about this)
 
_(failed) You find yourself walking slowly towards the sunlight, eager to rest and relax, here at the one welcoming and seemingly peaceful place you have seen in the forest. You don't know what helpful spirits guard this place, but it seems to be protected and safe, and a good place for a rest._
 
_(success) You shake your head and look around; you seem to be seeing double. The peaceful scene of blooms in winter is superimposed on a rocky hill, with only dead trees and scraggly thornbushes bearing dead flowers. The scent of decay is overwhelming. \<People who failed save\> seem to be heading towards a particularly thorny bush to lay down for a rest._
 
The illusion is tied to the smell of the flowers. Burning the thorn bushes will stop the illusion. You can also forcibly drag the affected people away, or something else creative. Anyone who leaves who failed the save will suffer one level of exhaustion, unless illusion is destroyed. Resting here does not restore HP/spell slots/etc, and instead of healing causes you to gain 1 level of exhaustion. Each day can make another CON save, if succeed will break illusion.
 
Thornbushes are fed by the decaying corpses of people who just lay down to rest and never got up. ￼

18. Risk of losing trail / becoming lost
             
A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage. Even on the road, a navigation check is required to stay on track (DC 10), and off the road it is much harder (DC 20)
 3. Risk of delay
   

Come to a fork in the path or trail they are following. DC 20 Survival check; on fail think footprints go left, which is well traveled. However this is a magical loop; will travel for an hour then come back to the same fork. DC 14 Intelligence check to recognize it is the same thing; same survival check. Will keep wasting time until make the survival or intelligence check.

**Spooky**
 
1. Magical plants / trees / forest area
 
Area where trees are growing above the ground, floating in the air, roots dangling down. Flickering lights. If they rest here, Will O' Wisps appear but make it clear that sleeping probably a bad idea if they are near to nightfall.
 
1. Feywild/Shadowfell connection
 
A large moss-covered single standing stone. Searching will reveal runes, make up some history of the pre-Drankorian people who lived here. Every minute of time next to the stone is 30 minutes in the real world. Describe the world fading and the quiet getting deeper as they approach.
 
1. Illusion/vision of the past or mysterious beasts or something
 
The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. If hurry will see 6 Sembaran soldiers in battle with a Chimera. Neither side seems to notice party. As they watch the dragon head breaths fire and three soldiers go down.
 
If they attack, the illusion shatters. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 Sembaran soldiers (long dead), some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.
 
1. Scary noises
 
Cackling laughter follows them. No effect but play up the spookiness.

False Appearance. While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a dead tree.
 
Siege Monster. The blight deals double damage to objects and structures.
   

_____________________ Actions _____________________
 
Multiattack. The blight makes four attacks: two with its branches and two with its grasping roots, If it has a target grappled, the blight can also make a bite attack against the target as a bonus action.
 
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8+6) piercing damage.
 
Branch. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit (3d6+6) bludgeoning damage.
 
Grasping Root. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature not grappled by the blight. Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 9 (1d6+6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The root has AC 15 and can be severed by dealing 6 slashing damage or more to it at once. Cutting the root doesn't hurt the blight but ends the grapple.

**Quest for the Corpse Flower**
 
If party is charmed into accepting quest, or decides to for other reasons, resolve as follows:
 
1. Finding the flower: for each hour of searching at a slow pace, roll a Wisdom (Survival) check. A DC of 13 discovers flower; a DC of 10 clues to flower; below 10 nothing.
2. Flower will be guarded by assassin vine
3. To cut flower without harm requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Nature) check. Failing destroys blossom, releasing toxic fumes (DC 11 Con save or 1d8 poison damage and poisoned for next 1 hour). Each vine will typically have 1d4+2 flowers.

![ASSASSIN VINE Large plant unaligned Armor Class 13...](Exported%20image%2020251029114000-2.png) ![Tangleweed is an invasive plant that can lash out ...](Exported%20image%2020251029114006-3.png)

Can repel tangleweed with salve made from Duskthorn dryad fruit; satyrs also are immune and can make a paste that will protect wearer for 24 hours.
 
Add Tangleweed to places kind of at random, especially blocking things they need and especially if they haven't encountered any fey yet.

1. Possible combat encounter: Darkwood incursion. T1d4+1 **vine blights** and 1d6+1 **needle blights** ambush. Needle blights will call to other needle blights - if encounter happens at night it will not be safe to rest unless they move camp. **[ONLY ON ROAD AFTER VILLAGE]**
2. Hazard: A. [**AFTER VILLAGE ONLY]**
3. Non-combat flavor: [**AFTER VILLAGE ONLY]**
