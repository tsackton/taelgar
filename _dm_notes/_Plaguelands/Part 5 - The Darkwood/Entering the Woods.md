Session start notes:
 
**Darkwood Keep finish**
 
First need to finish Darkwood Keep -- Maglar will wake them early and ask if the porticullus was up or down yesterday. A little suspicious it is up now -- did we kill all the undead?
 
Let them deal with this however they like - run skeleton encounter; can search guard house.
 
Message from Efrin in morning:
 
"If allies and with Maglor, say name of Maglor's grandfather (10) in next message. I search for Cinder Court Darkwood base (10). More after confirmation of trust."
 
Maglor will tell them Efrin may have left Ranger marks near woods, should travel together to edge of forest if the party indeed intends to search for Darkwood Keep garrison in the Darkwood.
 
Will give them 5 rations, warn them about eating the food in the Darkwood -- plants are generally okay (berries, nuts) but be wary of killing anything, plant or animal, for food in the Darkwood. Be wary of still pools of calm water, drink rain or flowing streams.
 
If they think can search pantry for food; can also ask Jafri about what he has.
 
**Entering the Woods**
 
Maglar will find a Ranger mark indicating where Efrin following trail into woods. Starts on a clear path with evidence of many footprints passing over in the past few weeks, heading west.
 
Trail diminishes; tracks continue to be follow-able with a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check, with the DC increasing by one after each long or short rest.
 
Maglor will give them a brief note about the woods -- the source of the River Lew is in the Darkwood. If lose trail, head due West until you find the river, which will give you a landmark to navigate by. Towards the south the land slopes up and there are some rough hills, but generally the Darkwood fills a low area between the hills east of Darkwood Keep and the hills west of the forest.
 
Can give them map I printed too I guess.
