 
A shepherd (**Gyles**) is just off the road (grumpy old man, annoyed at earl for not dealing with problems), watching helplessly as three **giant vultures** are circle overhead, attacking his sheep
 
_As you come around a bend in the road, emerging from an area of orchards, you see ahead of you four enormous birds, covered in dark feathers except for their heads and necks. One is deep in the guts of a dead sheep, and the other three are nearby, angrily squawking at a older man with a quarterstaff, who is trying to keep his sheep behind him._

While the vultures are semi-intelligent, and will coordinate their attacks, they are out for themselves. Any vulture reduced to 10 hp or below will attempt to grapple an unconscious individual (or the dead sheep if available, or a live sheep), and then flee.
 
If two vultures are killed or flee, the rest will abandon the field.
 
After combat, the shepherd will thank party profusely. If all vultures killed, will offer them a meal and a rest but won't press issue. If some escaped, will beg the party to stay the night to stand guard in case they come back.
