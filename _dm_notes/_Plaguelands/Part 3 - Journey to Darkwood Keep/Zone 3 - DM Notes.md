## Overview:
 
This area is mostly wild now, although historically it was settled by hunters, trappers, woodsman, and others who made their living off the forest (although no one went too deep into the Darkwood).
 
## Description:
 
After you cross the last bridge, you notice immediately that the land becomes more wild. Fields give way to stands of trees and open woods, with the occasional meadow clearing or hill peaking out of the tree. The road is quiet, and there are few signs of settlement anywhere.
 
## Challenge:

**Navigation DC**: 10 off road, no check needed if just following the road  
**Forage DC**: DC 12 (generally decent amount of game and food, but season not ideal)  
**Danger Number:** 3  
**Discovery Number:** 1
 
**Complications**:  
Encounters; Flavor Effects; Hazard Cards; Global Effects; Plot Developments
 
(remove any that happen in Zone 1 or 2)

## Complications (d8):

1. Possible combat encounter: Hobgoblin patrol party. A small patrol of hobgoblins is moving along the road (consisting of 5 **hobgoblins,** and 1 **hobgoblin captain**). They are moving quietly but following the road, not trying to be particularly stealthy. If they notice the party, they will not necessarily attack, but will challenge them and attempt to intimidate / get them to flee. They will not fight to the death, instead will attempt an organized retreat if needed. **[BEFORE VILLAGE ONLY]**
2. Possible combat encounter: Bugbear raiders. A small raiding party of bugbears and hobgoblins is returning from mischief, expecting to be in safe territory now, traveling along the road. They are not particularly trying to be stealthy. All monsters Passive Perception is 10. Total number is 2 **bugbears**, and 1d3+2 **hobgoblins**.
    1. Developments: if they were killed in Zone 2, ignore this result (nothing happens)
    2. **[THESE WERE KILLED]**
3. Possible combat encounter: **Undead rider.** This creature will not bother to attack the party directly unless pursued - instead will get off a few spells and act creepy before riding away (will be hard to catch with high movement speed -- stat block is below). Should be more of a freaky mood encounter than a real combat. [**AFTER VILLAGE ONLY]**
4. Possible combat encounter: Darkwood incursion. The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles. 1d4+1 **vine blights** and 1d6+1 **needle blights** ambush. Needle blights will call to other needle blights - if encounter happens at night it will not be safe to rest unless they move camp. **[ONLY ON ROAD AFTER VILLAGE]**
5. Hazard: A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage. Even on the road, a navigation check is required to stay on track (DC 10), and off the road it is much harder (DC 20). [**AFTER VILLAGE ONLY]**
6. Non-combat flavor: The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest (INT Save DC 16 to recognize something is off). The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 Sembaran soldiers (long dead), some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee. [**AFTER VILLAGE ONLY]**

## Discoveries (d3):

1. Rune stone
    1. Etched runes in Old Skaegish: "Ormar Kellison raised this stone for Jorga the Bold, Warrior Queen of the Green Hills. Here she stays to protect us from the Shadow evermore, watchful over the weak spots of the world. Her light will be a flame of this world." The stone itself is partially fallen, and a ring of white quartz blocks around the stone is only partially complete. Digging around will reveal a grave? Some treasure but also consequences for graverobbing (attack and curse?). Maybe reward for restoring it in some way? Or nearby ruins?
2. Old Ranger camp
    1. In a stand of trees off the road, a wooden lean-to with an old trail leading to it. DC 12 Perception to notice. Not actively used, but has some arrows, rations, and other useful items stashed.   
   
 
Save for actual Darkwood:  
Hazard: The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.
