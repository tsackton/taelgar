_While the river generally follows a slow, meandering path across the landscape with an easy current, here the current picks up and the path of the water travels through a narrow channel with some rocky outcroppings. An overloaded riverboat is foundering in the rapids. On board are what look like several families, and the deck of the boat is crowded with sheep, barrels, and loosely stacked trade goods. The people and sheep are both beginning to panic, causing the boat to rock, in danger of cap-sizing._
 
Ultimately righting the boat requires a DC 20 Dexterity (water vehicles) skill check. Failure capsizes the boat.
 
The DC can be reduced in a number of ways:  
-the people and sheep are both starting to panic. Calming the sheep requires a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check; on success DC of main check is reduced by 3. Calming people requires a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check; on success DC of main check is reduced by 2.  
-success on a DC 15 Strength (Survival) check can reposition the boat; this reduces DC of main check by 3.
 
Other reasonable suggestions can also help, and if they come up with a way for two people to assist they can roll main check with Advantage.
 
On success, the people will offer something -- small amount of gold, food, etc
