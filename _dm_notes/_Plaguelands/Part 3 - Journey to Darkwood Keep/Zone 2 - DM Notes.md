## Overview:
 
This area is more sparsely settled, especially further south, and in more danger from the Darkwood and hobgoblins. It is, however, still rich land and has a long history of farming.
 
## Description:
 
This area is more sparsely settled, with small stands of trees, and more rolling hills. Small villages still exist but more have been abandoned, and greater signs of disturbance. Fewer travelers on the road, and those that are out tend to be fleeing north. Hardy folk who remain tend to be shepherds who can't abandon their livelihood; those who are fleeing tend to be ones whose orchards or fields have been destroyed already. In this zone is also the most likely area to encounter patrols from Adderfell, or groups of Rangers moving across the landscape.
 
## Challenge:

**Navigation DC**: 5 off road, no check needed if just following the road  
**Forage DC**: no check needed if they are willing to steal food from fields or buy from farmers; DC 10 to scrounge wild game, berries from hedgerows, etc  
**Danger Number:** 2  
**Discovery Number:** 1
 
**Complications**:

(remove any that happen in Zone 1, except guard patrol)

## Complications (d8):

1. Possible combat encounter: Cinder Court cultists. A small group of cultists hurrying away from Adderfell (one **spy**, two **cultists**, one **thug** that escaped from Cinder Court hideout, and one **scout** and one additional **cultist** that joined on the road). A DC 15 Intelligence (Perception) check will allow them to notice the **spy** is the same one from Adderfell. This group is traveling incognito, so while describe them as larger group that expected, etc, they will not automatically attack.
    1. _Developments: only happens if this group is still alive and were not encountered in Zone 1_
2. Possible combat encounter: Hobgoblin raiding party. A small raiding party of hobgoblins and Cinder Court members is moving across the land (consisting of 1d4+1 **bandits**, 1d2+2 **hobgoblins,** and 1 **hobgoblin iron shadow**). They are moving quietly alongside road; they are heading to set some fires at night and retreat, so they will not attack unless they outnumber the party by a decent amount (at least 7 of them), in which case they will attempt to ambush if possible. Protocol for resolving encounter:
    1. If party is being stealthy, then first step is to check party's stealth roll against Passive Perception of 12. If at least half of them beat 12, they remain hidden and are not detected by hobgoblins.
    2. Second, check the hobgoblins against the party. Roll a stealth check for each monster (+1 for bandits/hobgoblins, +5 for iron shadow). If at least half of them beat highest passive perception in party, hobgoblins remain hidden.
    3. If hobgoblins and party both remain hidden, nothing happens.
    4. If hobgoblins are hidden, but they detect party, then they will attack if there are 7 or more of them, otherwise stay hidden. For the attack, the baddies that beat the passive perception benchmark get to attack during the first turn, the rest do not, and no PC gets to act.
    5. If the hobgoblins are detected but the party is hidden, PCs can decide what to do.
    6. If neither are hidden, hobgoblins will attack if at least 7 of them, otherwise attempt an orderly retreat.
    7. In general if neither party is surprised encounter should start at pretty long distance, otherwise based on circumstances
    8. _Developments: Remove this encounter if this raiding party is killed in Zone 1._
3. Possible combat encounter: Bugbear raiders. A small raiding party of bugbears and hobgoblins is out for mischief, going around burning farms and orchards. Roll a d6 - on a 1-3, they are encountered in the process of burning some buildings, and can be surprised if they don't notice party. On a 4-6, they are traveling along side of road, stealthy. Resolve as #2, although bugbears get +6 to stealth. All monsters Passive Perception is 10. Total number is 2 **bugbears**, and 1d3+2 **hobgoblins**.
4. Hazard: as number 3 in zone 1, unless already encountered
5. Hazard: Thunderstorm. Can find shelter with DC 15 survival check (partial shelter on 10-14); if they don't find shelter or continue to travel then horses will be spooked by lightning strike, DC 15 animal handling check or they run off (can also potentially give a DC 20 strength check to hold onto lead). If someone is riding a horse, DC 10 Dex save to avoid falling off. Can track horses with DC 10 survival; degree of failure represents how long it takes to find them (for each point of failure and extra 1, up to max of 4 hours).
6. Non-combat flavor: A pile of chopped down apple trees, with lots of fruit left to rot, and a banner stuck in the ground with the Cinder Court sign on it.
7. Guard patrol. Group of 9 mounted soldiers from Adderfell, riding in search of hobgoblin raiders.
8. Ranger patrol. Group of 3 Rangers (druid + fighter + scout), moving quietly along side of road.

## Discoveries (d3):

1. Ruined Drankorian supply depot (cross out if discovered in previous area) [USED}
    1. No monsters, but some dangerous terrain, old traps, etc
        1. Two storey stone structure. Fireplace, rusting iron cookware, rotting benches, and a well here. Well still has good water and there seem to be tracks going back and forth to well (DC 15 perception to notice). No treasure on first floor.
        2. Stairs to second floor are unstable. DC 20 perception check identifies weak step; DC 15 acrobatics check gets across; DC 15 Dex save avoids damage. Fall does 1d6 bludg.
        3. Second floor is difficult terrain - roof has collapsed. DC 15 perception check to find smashed chest buried under some rubble. DC 15 strength check to move rubble; for every point of failure requires an extra 15minutes to clear. Success takes 1/2 hour. Reduce travel distance by amount of time taken; if takes \>= 2 hours, roll an extra complications d6 (complication occurs on a 1). If someone helps, strongest character makes check with advantage.
        4. While clearing rubble, if someone is watching for danger DC 20 perception check to spot poisonous snake in rubble. If succeed can call out and avoid snake. If fail, Dex save (DC 15) to avoid being bitten; if bitten take 1 point piercing damage and DC 10 Con save. Take 2d4 poison damage, half as much on a successful save.
        5. In smashed chest, some Drankorian coins: 5d6 gold, 9d4 silver.
        6. In addition to the chest, some spell scrolls buried in rubble (1d2). DC 20 perception check to notice (same check as finding chest but higher DC). If they clear rubble looking for chest, second DC 15 perception check allowed to find scrolls. DC 10 Dex check required to remove them without damage; if someone helps by lifting up boulder (DC 10 STR check), get advantage on Dex roll. If fail, roll 1d4: nothing happens on 1-2, one scroll destroyed on 3, both on 4.
2. Fallen stone circle
    1. Etched runes in Old Skaegish: "Ormar Kellison raised this stone for Jorga the Bold, Warrior Queen of the Green Hills. Here she stays to protect us from the Shadow evermore, watchful over the weak spots of the world. Her light will be a flame of this world." The stone itself is partially fallen, and a ring of white quartz blocks around the stone is only partially complete. Digging around will reveal a grave? Some treasure but also consequences for graverobbing (attack and curse?). Maybe reward for restoring it in some way? Or nearby ruins?
3. Old Ranger camp
    1. In a stand of trees off the road, a wooden lean-to with an old trail leading to it. DC 12 Perception to notice. Not actively used, but has some arrows, rations, and other useful items stashed.
