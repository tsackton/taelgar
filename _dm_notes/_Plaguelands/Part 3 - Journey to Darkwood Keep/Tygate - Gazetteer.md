_The road turns across the river again here, crossing on an arched stone bridge, decorated with waterfall motifs representing the crest of Addermarch. A few miles further on, you see on the horizon a small village on the river, surrounded by a wooden palisade. The gates stand open, and signs of a hasty departure are evident._
 
The gate is not guarded. Inside the village is deserted. A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals faint sounds from the inn, but otherwise the village is silent. If they go to the inn:
 
_The one building with any signs of life is the inn, The Fox and Maple. Inside the inn, you see a group of seven people - men and women - sitting around a couple of tables, helping themselves to what cider and food is left in town. They seem travel worn, and tired._
 
These are Cinder Court cultists, escaped from Adderfell, but are posing as woodsmen, hunters, and trackers whose homesteads to the south were destroyed, and are on their way north to find safety. To detect the lie, roll Wisdom (Insight) contested by spy's Charisma (Deception), which has a +6 modifier.
 
On a DC 15 Int (Perception) check, Meriele/Evendur/Thardin can recognize the spy as the one from Adderfell watching the owlbear.
 
To notice cult symbols on wrist, Wisdom (Perception) vs Dex (Sleight of Hand). Cultists have +1, thugs have +0, spies have +4. If the Adderfell spy is not recognized but thugs and/or cultists are, spies & cultists who make their sleight of hand checks will attempt to pretend they were duped, and "side" with the party. They will turn on the party in the 2nd round of combat.
 
To detect, another contested Wis (Insight) vs Cha (Deception) -- cultists +2, spies +5. Thugs will not think of this tactic, and if any thugs are detected they will all attack.
 
Total combat if it occurs is three **thugs**, two **cultists**, two **spies**.
 
Otherwise, town is deserted. There are stores at the inn that were too heavy to carry, but
