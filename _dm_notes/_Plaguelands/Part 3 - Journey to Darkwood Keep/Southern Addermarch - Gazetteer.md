**Overview:**
 
The southern portion of Addermarch stretches roughly from the [Greenwood] in the west to the eastern border of the March in the hills in a line running roughly parallel to the northern edge of Adderfell lake, and ends at the southern border of the March.
 
This land is mostly a rich agricultural area, with a focus on producing apples for the famous local apple brandy. Adderfell itself is a center of distilling and production, with barrels of finished product shipped downriver to markets in Sembara and the Inner Sea. The river valley is gentle, rolling hills (think Finger Lakes), with patches of forest among orchards and pastures.
 
The climate here is temperate, with warm summers and mild, wet winters, albeit with threats of snow in higher elevations [perhaps similar to e.g. interior Virginia]. The terrain generally slopes up away from the river valley, more steeply on the eastern side.
 
Settlement density is high within a few days walk of Adderfell, and remains high to the east (until stopped by increasingly poor land in the mountains), to the west (until stopped by the forest), and the north.
 
Towards the south, settlement density drops considerably towards the frontier, as danger of raiding and monsters from the Plaguelands becomes too high.
 
A line of keeps and defensive fortifications about a day's journey south of the last settlements provide protection for some scattered foresters, hunters, and trappers in this area, but settlement density is quite low.
 
**Ambient Mood:**
 
The area close to Adderfell is rich agricultural land, full of orchards, tiny villages, pastures, and people, although few are on the road these days. The land becomes sparsely populated towards the south.
 
The terrain climbs a bit and becomes rougher, and the danger of raids increases. The landscape shifts to match the current mood of the Addermarch: as travelers go south, abandoned farms are more common, people are scarcer and more suspicious, the chance of raiders increases, and raiders are bolder [attacking broad daylight at full strength, rather than in an ambush].
 
As farms and pastures disappear, the land becomes more forested, rolling hills, and potential for ambush and raiders increases dramatically. Settlements here are rare and rugged.
 
Traveling south on the main [Drankorian] road, two substantial ancient bridges cross the [river needs a name]. In between these is the last fortified town on the route south.
 
Beyond the second river crossing is officially "wild", and the east side of the river is pretty much "wild" too this far south.
 
**Zones of Danger**:
 
- The area west and east of Adderfell, and extending about a day's travel (~20 miles) south, is densely settled and generally in the least danger. Although raids are increasing, they tend towards ambushes or attacks at night and not bands moving in the open.
- The area further south, to the 2nd bridge over the river, is frontier land. Here there are still orchards and pastures, but increasing forest cover as well, less settlement, and more danger.
- The area south of the 2nd river crossing is the wild, guarded only by patrols from Darkwood Keep and a small garrison at the town. The road cuts through light forest which blends into the Darkwood, gradually getting spookier and denser. The area around the keep is cleared, of course. Dark things lurk in the woods, and since the fall of Darkwood Keep this has not be a safe place to journey at all.
 
**Defenses:**
 
The Earl of Addermarch maintains a series of defensive fortifications spaced roughly 15 miles apart in a line running east from the Darkwood. The area west of the Darkwood has no developed fortifications, but is loosely patrolled by Rangers. Darkwood Keep is the largest and most important defensive point, as it guards the low point and most passable zone into Addermarch (the hills get steeper and rougher to the east), and also provides some protection against whatever may come out of the Darkwood.
 
**Settlements:**
 
- In zone 1, there are frequent manors, farms, small villages, and minor market towns. Orchards and pastures are common sights from the road, and finding a farm house to spend the night is an easy proposition.
- In zone 2, settlements are rarer, and tend to be more heavily fortified. Landscape is more wooded, and more people eek out a living in forestry and trapping/hunting. Some agriculture exists but population density is much lower, and villages tend to be fortified. One substantial town exists, about a days' march north of the Keep.
- In zone 3, there used to be small populations of hunters, woodsfolk, and others living in low density, often supplying timber to the river to be sold downstream to Adderfell, or hunting and trapping for furs. But with danger increasing, these folk have almost all abandoned their homes and fled north
 
**Ruins and Dungeons:**
 
- The whole area is has a long history of setttlement, from the original people's [first Northerners] who lived lightly on the land in small villages with hill forts and stone circles marking points of weakness between this world and the faery realm, to the Drankorians who invaded north and settled and turned this into a rich agricultural land, to the Sembarans who have been living and building in this area for hundreds of years now.
- Ruined watchtowers and small forts dating to Drankorian times are not uncommon
- Stone circles and other signs of the old gods and the Faery realm are also not terribly uncommon
- The Rangers do maintain some small fortifications, usually hidden, that serve as forward bases and safe places to camp, especially in Zone 3
- Also in Zone 3, Cinder Court / Hobgoblin forward camps are present
 
**Navigation and Pace:**
 
- In zone 1, navigation is not required, and food/water/shelter can be purchased at farmhouses. Traveling on road is somewhat faster than off road, but realistically the pace is roughly equivalent for any sensible path.
- In zone 2, navigation on the road also doesn't require a navigation check and moves at a normal pace. Off the road is roughly equivalent on pace, but requires a DC 10 navigation check to avoid becoming lost. Food can be purchased easily enough; water is plentiful; foraging is also possible If desired, with an easy DC (10).
- In zone 3, off road travel requires a DC 15 Navigation check to avoid becoming lost. Forgaging remains easy (DC 10). Traveling off road is difficult terrain, but only reduces movement by 1/3.
- At normal movement rates on the road, party will spend 1 day in each zone (~24 miles). Darkwood Keep will have rules for how adventure changes based on cumulative travel time (\>3 days or \<3 days).
