## Overview:
 
This area is densely settled and generally in the least danger. Although raids are increasing, they tend towards ambushes or attacks at night and not bands moving in the open.
 
## Description:
 
The area close to Adderfell is rich agricultural land, full of orchards, tiny villages, pastures, and people, although few are on the road these days. Traveling on the road mostly involves passing through fields and outlying houses with some small clusters of villages. On the river, same thing but fewer settlements. Traveling through farmland also pretty similar - not much wild space here.
 
## Challenge:

**Navigation DC**: 5 off road, no check needed if just following the road  
**Forage DC**: no check needed if they are willing to steal food from fields or buy from farmers; DC 15 to scrounge wild game, berries from hedgerows, etc  
**Danger Number:** 1  
**Discovery Number:** 1

## Complications (d8):

1. Possible combat encounter: Cinder Court cultists. A small group of cultists hurrying away from Adderfell (one **spy**, two **cultists**, one **thug** that escaped from Cinder Court hideout, and one **scout** and one additional **cultist** that joined on the road). A DC 15 Intelligence (Perception) check will allow them to notice the **spy** is the same one from Adderfell. This group is traveling incognito, so while describe them as larger group that expected, etc, they will not automatically attack.
    1. _Developments: If this encounter doesn't happen, or if they are not killed/captured by party, these cult members may show up in a later encounter, so keep track._
2. Possible combat encounter: Hobgoblin raiding party. A small raiding party of hobgoblins and Cinder Court members is moving across the land (consisting of 1d4+1 **bandits**, 1d2+1 **hobgoblins,** and 1 **hobgoblin iron shadow**). They are moving quietly alongside road; they are heading to set some fires at night and retreat, so they will not attack unless they outnumber the party by a decent amount (at least 7 of them), in which case they will attempt to ambush if possible. Protocol for resolving encounter:
    1. If party is being stealthy, then first step is to check party's stealth roll against Passive Perception of 12. If at least half of them beat 12, they remain hidden and are not detected by hobgoblins.
    2. Second, check the hobgoblins against the party. Roll a stealth check for each monster (+1 for bandits/hobgoblins, +5 for iron shadow). If at least half of them beat highest passive perception in party, hobgoblins remain hidden.
    3. If hobgoblins and party both remain hidden, nothing happens.
    4. If hobgoblins are hidden, but they detect party, then they will attack if there are 7 or more of them, otherwise stay hidden. For the attack, the baddies that beat the passive perception benchmark get to attack during the first turn, the rest do not, and no PC gets to act.
    5. If the hobgoblins are detected but the party is hidden, PCs can decide what to do.
    6. If neither are hidden, hobgoblins will attack if at least 7 of them, otherwise attempt an orderly retreat.
    7. In general if neither party is surprised encounter should start at pretty long distance, otherwise based on circumstances
    8. _Developments: If this encounter doesn't happen, or if they are not killed/captured by party, they will burn down a farm or two, and can be encountered in Zone 2 on their way back to base._
3. Hazard: Large group (4 wagons) of halflings traveling to Adderfell for winter fest, coming from south (but originally from east), had been trading at [[Tygate]] but left as danger increased and are now hoping to shelter in Adderfell. They are struggling to clear the road of several large fallen trees. DC 15 Int (investigation) or Int (Survival) check reveals trees did not fall naturally. Strength (Survival) check to help clear; DC 15 = 1 hour, for every 2 points above reduce by 15 minute (to min of 15 mintues), for every two points below increase by 30 minutes (to max of 4 hours). A second character can assist; succeed a DC 12 Int (Survival) check to figure out best way to proceed and/or a DC 12 Cha (Survival) check to organize halflings. Either reduces time; both gives advantage on Strength check and reduces time.
    1. If party helps, halfings can give some info on road ahead.
    2. **NEED NAMES (**[https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=com;com=halfling_male](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=com;com=halfling_male)) or [Halfing Names](Halfling.md)
4. Hazard: Thunderstorm. Can find shelter with DC 15 survival check (partial shelter on 10-14); if they don't find shelter or continue to travel then horses will be spooked by lightning strike, DC 15 animal handling check or they run off (can also potentially give a DC 20 strength check to hold onto lead). If someone is riding a horse, DC 10 Dex save to avoid falling off. Can track horses with DC 10 survival; degree of failure represents how long it takes to find them (for each point of failure and extra 1, up to max of 4 hours).
5. Non-combat flavor: A pile of chopped down apple trees, with lots of fruit left to rot, and a banner stuck in the ground with the Cinder Court sign on it.
6. Non-combat flavor: Refugees heading towards Adderfell. A family of five, two adults and three kids. All human, with a cart pulled by a mule piled with what little belonging they have. **Names**: Walter (dad), Mara (mom), Joane (daughter), Erys (daughter), Jamart (son). Weary, scared.
7. Guard patrol. Group of 9 mounted soldiers from Adderfell, riding in search of hobgoblin raiders.
8. Ranger patrol. Group of 3 Rangers (druid + fighter + scout), moving quietly along side of road.

## Discoveries (d3):

1. Roadside shrine to the Father (or the Traveler)
    1. Improvise, but if they given an offering have some kind of minor blessing for them
2. Water spirit spring
    1. Just of the road there is a short trail to a small pond. It is the spring of a rather large river downstream, a water spirit (**marid**/**nereid**) lives here. She is very picky about who and what may take water from her spring. You must be clean, you must be nice, and you must not stare at her delicate parts. Those that bring her suitable favours she will fill their water skin personally and turn it into a potion of (minor) healing. If any hostilities break out she will curse the perpetrators with thirst, water will turn to dust upon touching their lips, and flee through the spring.
3. Ruined Drankorian supply depot
    1. No monsters, but some dangerous terrain, old traps, etc
        1. Two storey stone structure. Fireplace, rusting iron cookware, rotting benches, and a well here. Well still has good water and there seem to be tracks going back and forth to well (DC 15 perception to notice). No treasure on first floor.
        2. Stairs to second floor are unstable. DC 20 perception check identifies weak step; DC 15 acrobatics check gets across; DC 15 Dex save avoids damage. Fall does 1d6 bludg.
        3. Second floor is difficult terrain - roof has collapsed. DC 15 perception check to find smashed chest buried under some rubble. DC 15 strength check to move rubble; for every point of failure requires an extra 15minutes to clear. Success takes 1/2 hour. Reduce travel distance by amount of time taken; if takes \>= 2 hours, roll an extra complications d6 (complication occurs on a 1). If someone helps, strongest character makes check with advantage.
        4. While clearing rubble, if someone is watching for danger DC 20 perception check to spot poisonous snake in rubble. If succeed can call out and avoid snake. If fail, Dex save (DC 15) to avoid being bitten; if bitten take 1 point piercing damage and DC 10 Con save. Take 2d4 poison damage, half as much on a successful save.
        5. In smashed chest, some Drankorian coins: 5d6 gold, 9d4 silver.
        6. In addition to the chest, some spell scrolls buried in rubble (1d2). DC 20 perception check to notice (same check as finding chest but higher DC). If they clear rubble looking for chest, second DC 15 perception check allowed to find scrolls. DC 10 Dex check required to remove them without damage; if someone helps by lifting up boulder (DC 10 STR check), get advantage on Dex roll. If fail, roll 1d4: nothing happens on 1-2, one scroll destroyed on 3, both on 4.
