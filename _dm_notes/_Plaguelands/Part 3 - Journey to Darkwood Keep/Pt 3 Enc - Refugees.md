_You see ahead of you on the road a large group of humanoids, maybe 20 or 30 in total, struggling to clear the road ahead. A large tree has fallen, perhaps struck by lightning, and made the road impassable. From this distance it is hard to make out details, but some seem to be riding carts pulled by mules, or pushing wheelbarrows, and there are a few horses and one wagon in the crowd. A notable herd of sheep is following behind._
 
This is a group of refugees fleeing [[Tygate]]: about 30 humans and dwarves trudging on foot north. A few are armed, including one of the dwarves. Can give party some information about the situation at [[Tygate]].
 
_As they approach, you can see this is clearly a group of refugees, mostly human but with a few dwarves marching together in the front. One of the dwarves is wearing a battered chain mail shirt and carrying a large warhammer, and seems to be something of a leader of this group, such as it is._
 
The dwarf at the head of the column is **Diesa**; she was the blacksmith in [[Tygate]] for many years. She is maybe 100 years old (middle-aged), but still strong, with braided red hair with ribbons throughout. She is weary and scared, but determined to get this group to safety in Adderfell, and blunt and direct in manner, often sighing in exasperation. She is a Stoneworker caste, clan Redbeard. The other dwarves with her are also of her clan, mostly cousins.
 
In addition, **Lady Isan,** the ruler of the village, is riding in the wagon with a few elderly/frail townsfolk. If the party stops to talk, she will come out of the wagon. She is talkative and nervous about the war, not prepared to be a battle commander or a leader of refugees seeking a new life.
 
_An older woman emerges from the wagon, dressed in fine silks, albeit somewhat muddied by travel. She has graying hair, pulled into a bun on top of her head._
 
Lady Isan is worried. She will tell story of undead rider. Also, Rangers came through two days ago (hard men, riding fast across the fields, no livery but seemed to be chasing hobgoblins so we listened), who told them of a small band of raiders. A messenger came through a few days ago from Darkwood Keep and reported all was well, hobgoblin siege had been broken, but scattered bands were fleeing north. We fled after that, heading north to safetly, but have not seen much evidence. Surprisingly quiet, except for the skeletal rider on the dead horse.
 
She can report the following about [[Tygate]]:  
-a few nights ago, a skeletal figure on a dead horse road up to town and stood watching the gate all night; gone in the morning; this was last straw for many who had remained until this point  
-many people fled after this
 
Mechanical system for clearing road:  
Strength (Survival) check to help clear; DC 15 = 1 hour, for every 2 points above reduce by 15 minute (to min of 15 minutes), for every two points below increase by 30 minutes (to max of 4 hours). A second character can assist; succeed a DC 12 Int (Survival) check to figure out best way to proceed and/or a DC 12 Cha (Survival) check to organize refugees. Either reduces time; both gives advantage on Strength check and reduces time.
