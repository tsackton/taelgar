Basic strategy / plot of this section is getting to the keep  
Trade-offs in speed vs safety  
Will have a simple system that will impact situation at keep based on how long it takes them to get there
 
**Travel time system:**
 
Let's be simple. Normally would take 3 days to cover the 70 miles, at a normal pace, traveling through easy terrain/the road, not pushing themselves.
 
Each day roll for Discoveries and for Complications.
 
In addition, aim for 6 fixed encounters planned on the map, which the party may or may not encounter depending on their route.
 
In addition, decisions they make can change time, albeit at a cost:  
-moving faster  
-moving longer
 
Danger Number should increase from 1 (nearest town) to 2 (intermediate) to 3 (closest to Darkwood Keep).
 
Have three zones of Complications, each a d6 table.
 
Zone 1: Civilized land, up to 1 day's travel from Adderfel  
Zone 2: borderlands, up to 2nd river crossing (roughly)  
Zone 3: badlands, from 2nd river crossing to keep
 
For Discoveries, number is 1 for zone 1 and 2, but 2 for badlands. Can use same discovery chart for all.

Plot Developments
 
Aiming for only 4 encounters on the road. Choose 1 fixed encounter per zone (total 3) and put it on the map. Choose 1 additional fixed encounter per zone (total 3) and put it off road somewhere where they might stumble onto it.
 
Design complications so that they will likely encounter 2-4 complications during the trip.
 
Since the fixed encounters tend to be mutually exclusive, that means about 5-9 encounters. If ~4 are minor/nuisance, then XP should work out.
 
This should probably be about 2 sessions of play.
