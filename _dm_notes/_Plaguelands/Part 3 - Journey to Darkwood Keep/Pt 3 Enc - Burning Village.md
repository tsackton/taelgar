_In the distance, you see a rising column of smoke from the banks of the river, and the faint echos of people shouting in fear and the clash of weapons._
 
A small village has been set on fire by the raiding party (zone 1 random encounter), and the people are being slaughtered.
 
If the party sprints, have them make some kind of check -- Con (Athletics) or Str (water vehicles) or something, with DC 12. Translate failure into dead villagers when they arrive.
 
If they move slowly / stealthily, can surprise, but most of villagers will be dead, just a handful hiding in a few houses survive.
 
Use stats for zone 1 raiding party; if zone 1 raiding party has been destroyed before party reaches this spot, village intact and fine.
