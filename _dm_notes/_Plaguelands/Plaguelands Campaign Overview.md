These are notes from an aborted and non-canonical campaign set in [[Adderfell]], southern Addermarch, and the Darkwood. 

Ran roughly Summer 2019 - Spring 2020, although may have ran a few scattered sessions through Fall 2020. 

Details are not considered canonical, and the [[Addermarch Campaign]] is in some ways a reboot of this campaign. Notes might still be worth mining for vibes and ideas, however.
