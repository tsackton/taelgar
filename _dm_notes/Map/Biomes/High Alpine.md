### High Alpine
_Bare rock, permanent or near-permanent snow and ice above the tundra and treeline. Air is thin, weather is brutal, and almost nothing grows except a little lichen in cracks._

**WWF category**: None (nival / icefield zone above formal biomes)  
_See more_: [Alpine climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_climate); [Nival zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nival_zone)

#### **Vibes**
- Jagged ridges, corniced crests, sheer cliffs and broken scree slopes with almost no visible soil or vegetation.
- Permanent or near-permanent **snowfields and small glaciers**, especially on shaded faces and cirques; fresh snow can fall in any season.
- Clear, thin air and harsh sun in sheltered spots; the moment clouds roll in or the sun sets, the cold bites hard.
- The world is mostly stone and ice: wind howls over exposed faces, avalanches and rockfalls rumble down gullies.
- Life feels pushed to the margins—tiny lichen patches on boulders, a rare hardy flower in a protected niche, distant silhouettes of raptors circling above the peaks.
    
#### **Ecology**
- **Dominant vegetation**: Essentially **no true vegetation cover** across most surfaces: bare rock, snow and ice dominate. Where anything grows, it is usually just lichens, mosses and a few extreme alpine plants clinging to cracks, ledges and sun-warmed hollows right at the lower boundary of this zone.
- **Common fauna**: Very few permanent residents. A handful of specialists such as small rodents nesting in talus, hardy insects and, on the lower edges, sure-footed goat or ibex analogues; large raptors and scavengers patrol the heights but mostly hunt in lower zones. Most animals only pass through, migrating over high passes or traversing ridges between valleys.
- **Conditions**: Altitudes at or near the highest elevations in a range, well above the treeline and above tundra-like vegetation. Temperatures are cold year-round; hard frosts can occur any night. Strong winds, intense UV radiation and frequent freeze–thaw cycles shape both rock and any living things.

#### **Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: No conventional permanent settlements. Any structures are exceptional: lonely watch-towers, remote monasteries, wizard’s observatories, shrines or monster lairs carved into cliffs and ice.
- **Agriculture**: None. Conditions are far too cold, rocky and unstable for crops or regular grazing; even hardy mountain livestock rarely venture this high except along very specific traversable routes.
- **Resources**: Snow and ice as the source of streams and rivers below; exposed bedrock revealing veins of ore; rare high-altitude herbs and lichens.
- **Travel & infrastructure**: Movement is slow and dangerous over steep slopes, loose scree, cornices and hidden crevasses. Routes follow the few feasible lines—knife-edge ridges, notched cols, zig-zag paths cut into cliffs—and may be blocked by snow, icefall or rockfall at any time.
#### **Real-world examples**

- **Highest peaks of the European Alps** – Bare rock and persistent snowfields above the last high pastures: cirques, arêtes and summit ridges around Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.
- **Himalayan summit zones** – Upper slopes and ridges of Everest, Annapurna and neighbours: thin air, ice cliffs, seracs and corniced crests above any plant life.
- **Andean nival belt** – Rock and ice crowns above puna grasslands and high plateaus, with small glaciers feeding valley glaciers and rivers below.
- **High Rockies summits** – Exposed ridges, corniced passes and summit blocks above the last alpine meadows, where only snow, ice and lichen remain.
- **Volcanic cones in tall ranges** – Bare, ash-dusty summit craters and cinder ridges of high stratovolcanoes rising above surrounding tundra or montane belts.

#### **When To Use**

**Latitude & climate context**
- In **mid-latitude and subtropical mountains**, High Alpine appears as a **narrow crown** on the tallest ranges: the final belt below any larger icecaps.
- At **higher latitudes**, treeline and tundra descend, so High Alpine begins at lower absolute elevations but still marks the highest, most hostile parts of the landscape.

**Elevation & position**
- Use **High Alpine** in hexes at or near the **absolute highest parts of a range**, where both forest and tundra have disappeared and the landscape is almost entirely rock, snow and ice. 

**Temperature & growing season**
- Temperatures are **cold year-round**; even in the warmest month, most of the hex hovers near or below freezing, with only brief daytime thaws in sheltered spots.    
- There is effectively **no true growing season** for most of the hex, only brief windows where microhabitats (sun-warmed ledges, protected hollows) allow a few specialized plants to flower and set seed.

**Snow, ice & precipitation**
- A significant fraction of the hex is covered by **permanent or near-permanent snow and ice**: small glaciers, névé fields and old snow patches that never fully melt.
- Precipitation often falls as snow, and storms can quickly coat passes and ledges with drifts or fresh ice that remain dangerous long after the storm has passed.
- Meltwater from high alpine snow and ice is an important headwater source feeding rivers and lakes in lower hexes.

**Soils & substrate**
- Soils, if present at all, are **extremely thin and discontinuous**, limited to pockets between rocks, behind small moraines or in tiny terraces where material has accumulated.
- Most surfaces are **bare bedrock, scree or boulder fields**. Frost shattering and freeze–thaw cycles constantly break and move rock, keeping many slopes unstable and vegetation-free.


**Relationship to other Taelgar habitats**
- **Above Tundra**: place High Alpine where tundra vegetation finally fails—beyond the last dwarf shrubs and grasses and into almost pure rock and snow. If you still expect continuous low vegetation, keep the hex as Tundra instead.
- **Above Open Highlands or montane forests**: forested slopes give way to open uplands, then tundra belts; once those give way to ice and rock, upgrade to High Alpine.
- On tall ranges with broad summit areas, you may have **continuous High Alpine plateaus**, while on narrower ridges it may appear only as scattered peaks and cols surrounded by lower habitats.
