### Tundra
*Cold, treeless plains found at high latitudes or altitudes. Ground is underlain by permafrost and the growing season is extremely short.*

**WWF category**: Tundra

#### **Vibes**
- Wide, open horizons of low shrubs, grasses, sedges, mosses, and lichens; **no real forests** and only the occasional stunted tree in sheltered hollows.
- Clear, thin air and **biting winds**; even in “summer” the landscape often feels chilly, with snow patches lingering in shadows.
- Wildlife is sparse but striking: migrating herds, lonely predators, huge flocks of breeding birds.

#### **Ecology**
- **Dominant vegetation**: Hardy dwarf shrubs, sedges, grasses, mosses and lichens dominate the tundra; they hug the ground to avoid wind and cold
- **Common fauna**: Small mammals such as lemmings and hares, large migrating herbivores like caribou and reindeer, and predators including Arctic foxes, wolves and snowy owls inhabit this biome. Many birds arrive only in summer to breed; insect swarms can be intense in wet areas during thaw.
- **Conditions**: Long, cold winters; warmest month rarely exceeding ~10 °C and often much lower. Annual precipitation is low (often under 25 cm) and primarily falls as snow; in arctic tundra, low evaporation means wet soils and standing water in summer. Soils are thin, poorly developed, often underlain by permafrost or seasonally frozen ground, which keeps water near the surface.

#### **Human use**
- **Population & settlement density**: Very sparse permanent population: scattered small villages, semi-nomadic herder camps, lone hermitages, and the occasional fortified outpost or monastery. Many sites are seasonal: summer hunting or grazing grounds, temporary mining camps, or ritual meeting places. 
- **Agriculture**: Virtually nonexistent due to frozen soils and short growing seasons,
- **Resources**: Subsistence herding of reindeer, fur trapping, harvest of hardy berries or lichens, limited mining and quarrying in exposed bedrock zones, especially where glaciers or frost have stripped away soil.
- **Travel & infrastructure:** Overland travel is relatively unobstructed by vegetation, but boggy ground, thaw, snow, and sudden storms make it treacherous. Paths and roads cling to ridge lines, river terraces, and gravelly high spots; rivers may be the only reliable summer routes. In winter, snowpack can improve mobility (sleds, skis, mounts adapted to snow) but raises the stakes for exposure and whiteouts.

#### **Real‑world examples**

- **Siberian tundra, Russia** – Vast stretches of moss, lichen and low shrubs, with migrating reindeer herds crossing frozen rivers and thaw ponds.
- **Canadian Arctic Archipelago** – Barren, treeless islands underlain by permafrost, with polar bears roaming coasts and sea-ice and seabird colonies nesting on rocky cliffs.
- **Alaska’s North Slope, USA** – Flat, treeless plains of sedges and tussock grasses, cut by meandering rivers and used as calving grounds for large caribou herds.
- **Finnmark plateau, Norway** – Rolling upland tundra of dwarf birch, heather and lichens, shaped by strong winds, snowfields and migrating reindeer.
- **Tibetan Plateau alpine tundra** – High-elevation tundra on the “roof of the world,” with wind-scoured grasslands, cushion plants and stark, glaciated peaks.

#### **When To Use**

**Latitude & climate band**
- At **high latitudes**: Place tundra in the coldest coastal plains and interiors closest to the pole, beyond the belt where Boreal Forest can survive. In the Köppen map, this usually corresponds to ET (tundra): the warmest month between 0–10 °C, with no month warm enough to support true forest.
- At **mid-latitudes**: Tundra mainly appears at high elevations, not in lowlands. It should be above the local treeline on major mountain ranges, where winters are long and severe and the growing season is so short that trees cannot establish, even if summer days are warm.

**Temperature & seasonality**
- Warmest month **< 10 °C** is a good rule of thumb: enough to allow grasses and shrubs to grow for a few weeks, but not enough for forest trees.
- Winters feature multi-month snow cover, frequent frosts, and strong winds; spring thaw is abrupt and messy.

**Precipitation & moisture**
- Total precipitation can be **low or moderate**, but because it’s cold: 
	- Evaporation is weak, so the ground tends to be waterlogged in summer.
	- Expect thaw ponds, soggy flats, and shallow streams in level areas.

**Soils & substrate**
- Use tundra where you expect **permafrost or seasonally frozen subsoil** near the surface. This blocks drainage and keeps water in the top layer, creating wet ground despite low rainfall.        
- On steep slopes, thin soils and frost heave create stony ground with patchy vegetation.

**Relationship to other Taelgar habitats**
- **Poleward / upward of Boreal Forest**: Tundra should generally form a band between conifer forests and any permanent icefields.
- **Above Open Highlands** or **Temperate Coniferous Forests** in mountains. Where highlands and moors give way to treeless, low-cushion vegetation, upgrade to Tundra.
- **Below High Alpine / Glacier.** As soon as vegetation drops to only lichens and bare rock with permanent snowfields, switch to High Alpine instead.
