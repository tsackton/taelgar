# Biomes of Taelgar

This document organizes Taelgar’s habitats into seven broad “supertypes.” Each supertype groups together related habitats; each habitat has a short description, a reference link to a corresponding real‑world biome, evocative vibes, an ecological summary, notes on human use and settlement, real‑world analogues, and guidance on where to place this habitat to keep the map grounded. 

(note: missing medi. woodlands and scrublands)
## Cold Lands
High elevation areas above or near the tree line fall into this category, as do high latitude environments that share properties such as harsh, cold winters and short growing seasons. High‑latitude tundra, alpine ridges, and boreal forests comprise this supertype.

## Desert

Deserts range from the hottest sand seas to semi‑arid shrublands. What unites them is low precipitation and sparse plant cover. The intensity of dryness determines whether you’re looking at a true arid desert or its semi‑arid margins.

### Arid Desert

**Short description**: Extremely dry environments where evaporation far exceeds precipitation and plant life is sparse. Features range from sand dunes to barren rock and salt flats.

**WWF category**: [Deserts and xeric shrublands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands)

**Vibes**

- Endless vistas of dune fields, rocky plains or cracked clay pans shimmering in the heat haze.
    
- Stark contrasts between scorching days and frigid nights; the desert sky is blindingly bright or filled with stars.
    
- Sparse vegetation clings to life in arroyos and wadis; the landscape hums with insects after rare rains.
    
- Winds sculpt the sand into ripples and dust devils; the air tastes of salt or dust.
    
- Travellers feel both awe and trepidation – the desert is beautiful but unforgiving.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Woody shrubs, succulents and annuals adapted to conserve water; many plants have small, waxy leaves or spines and deep roots[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands#:~:text=Deserts%20and%20xeric%20shrublands%20are,1).
    
- **Common fauna**: Reptiles (lizards, snakes), small mammals (gerbils, jerboas), insects and scorpions dominate; larger animals like camels, antelopes or oryx survive near oases.
    
- **Conditions**: Rainfall is very low, typically less than 25 cm per year[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands#:~:text=Deserts%20and%20xeric%20shrublands%20are,1); evaporation exceeds precipitation and soils are often salty.
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Extremely low; small oases or caravan stops support nomadic herders and traders.
    
- **Agriculture**: Limited to irrigated plots near oases or rivers; dates, figs and vegetables can be grown with irrigation.
    
- **Resources**: Important minerals (salt, phosphates, gold), petroleum deposits, rare desert plants and animals, and trade routes across the desert.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Sahara Desert, North Africa** – Vast sand seas, rocky plateaus and salt flats; Tuareg caravans traverse between oases.
    
- **Arabian Desert, Arabian Peninsula** – Rub’ al Khali (“Empty Quarter”) is one of the largest sand deserts in the world.
    
- **Namib Desert, Namibia** – Coastal desert with towering dunes and fog‑dependent plants.
    
- **Gobi Desert, China/Mongolia** – Cold desert of gravel plains and rocky outcrops, home to Bactrian camels and snow leopards.
    
- **Atacama Desert, Chile** – One of the driest places on Earth, with salt flats and copper mines.
    
- **Mojave Desert, USA** – High desert with Joshua trees and dramatic temperature swings.
    

**When to use this**

- Reserve arid deserts for the driest parts of your world where annual rainfall is less than 25 cm and vegetation is extremely sparse[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands#:~:text=Deserts%20and%20xeric%20shrublands%20are,1).
    
- These regions are typically located in subtropical high‑pressure belts, continental interiors or rain shadows of large mountain ranges.
    
- Topography may include dune fields, stony hamadas, salt flats and isolated oases; water is the limiting factor.
    
- Settlements cluster around rare water sources and overland routes; travel is perilous without supplies.
    
- Arid deserts transition into semi‑arid shrublands or steppe as rainfall slightly increases.
    

### Semi‑Arid Desert

**Short description**: Transitional deserts receiving slightly more rainfall than true arid deserts. Shrubs and grasses are more common, though the landscape still feels dry and open.

**WWF category**: [Deserts and xeric shrublands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands)

**Vibes**

- Rolling plains and rocky hills dotted with sagebrush, low shrubs and tufts of grass.
    
- Long views across open land; dust devils dance over baked earth during the heat of the day.
    
- Winds howl across exposed ridges; rain comes in brief, intense storms that quickly run off.
    
- A rugged, lightly vegetated landscape where pastoralists move livestock between scattered waterholes.
    
- The impression of a land on the edge – too dry for dense vegetation but not quite a true desert.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Drought‑tolerant shrubs (sagebrush, creosote), bunch grasses and occasional succulents; plant cover is low but more continuous than in arid deserts[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers).
    
- **Common fauna**: Pronghorn, jackrabbits, coyotes, kangaroo rats and ground‑nesting birds such as larks or roadrunners; reptiles and insects abound.
    
- **Conditions**: Annual rainfall ranges from about 25 cm to 50 cm[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers); soils are often alkaline and nutrient‑poor.
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low. Small towns or encampments develop near springs or seasonal streams.
    
- **Agriculture**: Dryland farming of hardy grains like millet or barley in wetter pockets; irrigated cropland near rivers.
    
- **Resources**: Extensive grazing for goats, sheep or hardy cattle; potential for wind or solar energy, and extraction of minerals and metals.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Great Basin, USA** – Basin‑and‑range topography with sagebrush plains and scattered ranches.
    
- **Patagonian steppe, Argentina** – Cool, windy plains where sheep ranching dominates.
    
- **Karoo, South Africa** – Shrubland plateau with hardy succulents and sheep farms.
    
- **Sahel, Africa** – A belt of semi‑arid grassland and shrubland between savanna and Sahara; seasonal grazing for cattle and camels.
    
- **Kazakh semi‑desert, Kazakhstan** – Rolling plains of feather grass and wormwood used for horse grazing.
    
- **Australian outback (semi‑arid interior)** – Red earth and scrub vegetation supporting cattle stations.
    

**When to use this**

- Situate semi‑arid deserts on the fringes of true deserts or in continental interiors where rainfall is low but not extreme (25–50 cm)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers).
    
- These landscapes often lie in rain shadows or form transitional zones between grasslands and deserts.
    
- Vegetation is scattered but continuous enough to support livestock; trees only grow along watercourses.
    
- Human use revolves around pastoralism and occasional dryland farming; large settlements are rare.
    
- Consider semi‑arid deserts when you want a dry, windswept expanse that still supports some life and travel routes.
    

## Temperate Forest

These forests grow in mid‑latitude zones with moderate rainfall and distinct seasons. They include both deciduous broadleaf forests and evergreen coniferous forests, as well as the vast cold taiga of the far north.

### Temperate Broadleaf Forest

**Short description**: Forests dominated by deciduous broadleaf trees that shed their leaves in autumn. They experience warm summers, cool winters and ample rainfall.

**WWF category**: [Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests)

**Vibes**

- Dappled sunlight filtering through a canopy of oaks, maples and beeches; a mosaic of green in spring and summer and a blaze of reds and golds in autumn.
    
- Crunching leaves underfoot, the scent of humus and mushrooms, and birdsong echoing from the understory.
    
- Streams meander through clearings; wildflowers blanket the forest floor in spring.
    
- The cycle of four seasons gives the forest a dynamic character: verdant growth, vibrant colour, stark dormancy and fresh renewal.
    
- Villages nestle in clearings or along riverbanks; hunters, foragers and woodcutters venture into the woods.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Canopy of broadleaf deciduous trees such as oaks, beeches, maples and birches, often mixed with conifers like pines or firs; a multilayered structure includes understory shrubs and a ground layer of herbs and ferns[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests#:~:text=Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest,and%20include%20%2094)[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests#:~:text=In%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%2C%20characteristic,as%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests).
    
- **Common fauna**: Deer, bears, wild boar, foxes, squirrels, a variety of songbirds and raptors, amphibians and countless insects. Forest patches support diverse life.
    
- **Conditions**: These forests thrive in climates with distinct warm and cool seasons and annual precipitation typically between 600 mm and 1 500 mm[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forests#:~:text=Temperate%20broadleaf%20%20and%20mixed,Temperatures%20are).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate to high. River valleys and forest clearings support towns and villages.
    
- **Agriculture**: Fertile soils allow grain and vegetable farming once forest is cleared; orchards and vineyards thrive on gentle slopes.
    
- **Resources**: Timber for building and fuel, wild game, nuts and berries, mushrooms, charcoal, tannins and medicinal plants.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- They often occupy foothills, river valleys or coastal plains between grasslands and coniferous highlands.
    
- Clearings and riverbanks provide space for settlements and agriculture; forests are easily logged and converted to cropland.
    
- Use this biome when you need a comfortable, resource‑rich environment with distinct seasonal changes.
    
- Temperate broadleaf forests transition into coniferous forests at higher elevations or latitudes and into prairies or steppes toward drier interiors.
    

### Temperate Coniferous Forest

**Short description**: Evergreen forests dominated by needle‑leaf trees. Found in cool temperate climates, often along coasts or in mountains.

**WWF category**: [Temperate coniferous forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forest)

**Vibes**

- Towering pines, cedars and firs create a cathedral‑like atmosphere; the forest floor is soft with needles and thick with ferns and moss.
    
- Cool, moist air and frequent fog give the woods a mysterious, subdued feel; resinous scents pervade.
    
- Waterfalls and streams tumble through steep valleys; rainfall is abundant in coastal variants.
    
- Wildlife tends to be more elusive – you might glimpse a deer in a glade or hear the hoot of an owl at dusk.
    
- Logging camps, sawmills and small homesteads carve clearings amidst the vast forest.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Needle‑leaf trees such as pines, cedars, firs, spruces and redwoods dominate; some broadleaf evergreens like eucalyptus may mix in mild regions[animalia.bio](https://animalia.bio/temperate-coniferous-forest#:~:text=Temperate%20coniferous%20forest%20is%20a,occurs%20in%20more%20tropical%20climates).

- They often occupy higher elevations above deciduous forests or occur in narrow bands along foggy coasts.
    
- Settlements may focus on forestry and woodcraft; agriculture is secondary due to acidic soils.
    
- Use this biome when you need towering evergreens, misty woods and abundant rainfall.
    
- These forests transition into boreal forests toward colder latitudes and into broadleaf forests or open highlands toward warmer or drier areas.
    


## Tropical

Tropical environments are found near the equator where temperatures are warm year‑round. Rainfall patterns—whether seasonal or constant—determine whether forests are moist or dry or whether grasslands dominate.

### Tropical Dry Forest

**Short description**: Deciduous forests in tropical and subtropical regions that experience a long dry season. Many trees shed their leaves to conserve water.

**WWF category**: [Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests)

**Vibes**

- Trees spaced widely apart create a mosaic of sun and shade; dry leaves crackle underfoot during the dry season.
    
- A dusty, earthy smell lingers in the dry months; after rains, the forest bursts into new leaf and blossoms.
    
- Birds and monkeys call from the canopy, but water sources are scarce until the monsoon arrives.
    
- Fires may sweep through during the driest periods, clearing undergrowth and renewing grasses.
    
- The landscape feels both open and wooded, with a pronounced seasonal rhythm.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Deciduous trees such as teak, acacia and baobab that drop their leaves in the dry season, along with some drought‑tolerant evergreens[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=The%20tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry,living%20things%20in%20the%20forest).
    
- **Common fauna**: Primates (howler monkeys, lemurs), ungulates (deer, antelope), large cats (jaguars), parrots and ground‑dwelling birds, plus a variety of insects and reptiles[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=The%20tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry,living%20things%20in%20the%20forest).
    
- **Conditions**: Warm temperatures year‑round. Rainfall can be considerable but is concentrated in a wet season, leaving the rest of the year dry[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=The%20tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry,living%20things%20in%20the%20forest).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate. Villages cluster near rivers or waterholes; seasonal labour migrations are common.
    
- **Agriculture**: Fields of maize, sorghum or beans flourish during the wet season; fruit orchards and grazing occur during drier months.
    
- **Resources**: Valuable timber (teak, mahogany), fuelwood, medicinal plants, wildlife and honey; charcoal production is common in some regions.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Yucatán dry forests, Mexico** – Seasonal forests with Maya ruins and wildlife such as howler monkeys and ocellated turkeys.

**When to use this**

- Situate tropical dry forests in low‑latitude regions that experience a pronounced dry season, often on the leeward side of mountains or far from oceanic moisture[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_dry_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=The%20tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry,living%20things%20in%20the%20forest).
    
- Annual rainfall may vary between about 700 mm and 2 000 mm, but most falls during a few months; the rest of the year is dry.
    
- These forests transition into savannas and thorn scrub as rainfall declines and into moist tropical rainforests where rainfall increases.
    
- Human settlements rely on seasonal rivers and wells; agriculture and pastoralism are both viable depending on water.
    
- Use this biome where you want a balance of open woodland and grassland with strong seasonal contrasts.
    

### Tropical Rainforest

**Short description**: Dense, multi‑layered evergreen forests in equatorial regions with constant warmth and abundant rainfall. They support unparalleled biodiversity.

**WWF category**: [Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests)

**Vibes**

- A towering canopy blocks much of the sunlight; the understory is dark, humid and alive with vines and ferns.
    
- Every surface seems coated in life: mosses, orchids, bromeliads and lichens cling to branches and trunks.
    
- Sounds of insects, birds and mammals reverberate through the forest; rain drips continuously from leaves.
    
- The air is heavy and fragrant with the scents of decay and blossoms; colours are deep greens punctuated by bright flowers.
    
- A sense of being enclosed in a living labyrinth; navigation follows rivers and animal trails.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Tall evergreen and semi‑deciduous trees form multiple canopy layers; lianas, epiphytes and ferns abound[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=TSMF%20is%20generally%20found%20in,1).
    
- **Common fauna**: Insects (butterflies, ants), birds (toucans, hornbills), primates (gibbons, spider monkeys), arboreal mammals (sloths), reptiles (snakes, frogs) and apex predators like jaguars[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=TSMF%20is%20generally%20found%20in,1).
    
- **Conditions**: Rainfall often exceeds 2 000 mm per year and is distributed throughout the year, creating high humidity and rapid plant growth[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=TSMF%20is%20generally%20found%20in,1).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low overall; small villages or tribal groups live along rivers and clearings.
    
- **Agriculture**: Shifting cultivation (slash‑and‑burn) of tubers, fruits and grains; permanent agriculture is challenging due to leached soils.
    
- **Resources**: Hardwood timber (mahogany, ebony), rubber, nuts, fruits, spices, medicinal plants and wildlife; rivers provide fish and transport.

**When to use this**

- Reserve tropical rainforests for equatorial zones with year‑round high rainfall (>2 000 mm) and uniformly warm temperatures[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests#:~:text=TSMF%20is%20generally%20found%20in,1).
    
- They often occur along lowland river basins, coastal plains or windward mountain slopes where moisture is abundant.
    
- Rainforests transition into tropical dry forests where rainfall is more seasonal and into montane cloud forests at higher elevations.
    
- Human use is limited by dense vegetation and poor soils, so settlements cluster along rivers and rely on forest products.
    
- Use this biome when you want an exotic, richly detailed environment teeming with life and challenging travel.
    

### Tropical Conifer Forest

**Short description**: Coniferous forests occurring in tropical and subtropical regions, typically at moderate elevations with distinct wet and dry seasons. Pines and firs are dominant instead of broadleaf trees.

**WWF category**: [Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests)

**Vibes**

- Sunlight streams through resin‑scented pine branches, casting long shadows on the forest floor.
    
- Understory is open with scattered ferns and shrubs; one can see far between trunks compared to a rainforest.
    
- Temperatures are cooler than surrounding lowlands; mornings are often misty, afternoons sunny.
    
- Occasional patches of broadleaf trees add diversity; bird calls ring clearly in the thin mountain air.
    
- Paths wind between needle‑strewn slopes, leading to small hamlets or terraced fields.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Diverse conifers including pines, firs, cedars and cypresses form a dense canopy; some oaks and broadleaf trees mix in[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests#:~:text=Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20coniferous%20forests,3).
    
- **Common fauna**: Deer, small cats, rabbits and coatis; birds like woodpeckers, jays and warblers; insects and reptiles adapted to drier conditions[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests#:~:text=Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20coniferous%20forests,3).
    
- **Conditions**: Moderate temperatures with a pronounced dry season; precipitation is lower than in cloud forests, and fires may occur periodically[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests#:~:text=Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20coniferous%20forests,3).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate. Indigenous villages and logging communities occupy ridges and valleys.
    
- **Agriculture**: Terraced fields of maize, beans or potatoes; fruit orchards and grazing in clearings.

**When to use this**

- Place tropical conifer forests on uplands or mountain slopes in tropical or subtropical regions where temperatures are cooler and rainfall is seasonal[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_coniferous_forests#:~:text=Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20coniferous%20forests,3).
    
- These forests often sit between drier lowland savannas or dry forests and wetter montane cloud forests or broadleaf rainforests at higher elevations.
    
- Human settlements make use of terraced fields and forest resources; pathways wind through open understories.
    
- Use this biome when you want a distinctive evergreen forest in a warm latitude without the lushness of a rainforest.
    
- They can also serve as transition zones leading into highland grasslands or alpine zones.
    

### Tropical Savanna

- **African Sahel, west Africa** – Transition zone between Sahara and savanna with nomadic herders and drought‑tolerant grasses.
    
- **Northern Australian savannas, Australia** – Eucalyptus‑dominated savannas with seasonal monsoons and Aboriginal land management.
    

**When to use this**

- Locate tropical savannas in subtropical and tropical belts between 30° N and 30° S where rainfall is strongly seasonal[evolution.earthathome.org](https://evolution.earthathome.org/grasses/tropical-grasslands/#:~:text=Tropical%20grasslands%2C%20many%20of%20which,per%20year).
    
- They often lie between rainforests or dry forests and semi‑arid deserts or steppe, forming broad belts across continents.
    
- The balance of grass and trees shifts with rainfall and fire frequency; frequent fires maintain open conditions.
    
- Human life is mobile: herding and seasonal agriculture adapt to water availability, and settlements cluster along rivers or lakes.
    
- Use savannas to depict open, wildlife‑rich landscapes with dramatic seasonal contrasts.
    

## Grasslands

These are temperate to subtropical regions dominated by grasses. They range from fertile prairies to semi‑arid steppes and include managed pasturelands.

### Prairie

**Short description**: Temperate grasslands with moderate precipitation and deep, fertile soils. Historically dominated by tall or mixed grasses, many prairies have been converted to farmland.

**WWF category**: Temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands

**Vibes**

- Rolling seas of grass and wildflowers swaying in the wind under a vast sky; trees are scarce except along rivers.
    
- Thunderheads build in the distance; storms sweep across the plain with lightning and rainbows.
    
- The earth feels rich and loamy; prairie dogs whistle and bison or elk once roamed in herds.
    
- Fire is part of the landscape: controlled burns or lightning ignite patches of dry grass, renewing growth.
    
- Settlements appear as farmsteads or small towns surrounded by endless fields of crops.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Tall and mixed grasses such as big bluestem, switchgrass and needlegrass; forbs and wildflowers create seasonal colour[animalia.bio](https://animalia.bio/temperate-grasslands#:~:text=Temperate%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands,types%20of%20species%20found%20here).
    
- **Common fauna**: Grazing animals like bison and pronghorn, burrowing creatures such as prairie dogs and ground squirrels, predators like coyotes and badgers, and numerous ground‑nesting birds[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/prairie/#:~:text=Prairies%20are%20enormous%20stretches%20of,the%20middle%20of%20North%20America).
    
- **Conditions**: Moderate rainfall (often 500 mm to 900 mm) supports continuous grass cover; periodic fires and grazing prevent tree encroachment[animalia.bio](https://animalia.bio/temperate-grasslands#:~:text=Temperate%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands,types%20of%20species%20found%20here).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate to high. Farmsteads and towns are common; major trade routes cross these open lands.
    
- **Agriculture**: Very high potential; prairies are often the “breadbaskets” of their continents, producing wheat, corn and other grains[plainshumanities.unl.edu](https://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ag.001.html#:~:text=The%20Great%20Plains%20is%20an,reach%20markets%20around%20the%20world).
    
- **Resources**: Fertile soils for crops, grazing land, occasional mineral deposits (coal, oil) and abundant wildlife for hunting.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Great Plains, USA/Canada** – Former tallgrass and mixed prairies turned into extensive wheat and corn fields.
    
- **Pampas, Argentina/Uruguay** – Fertile grasslands supporting cattle ranching and grain production.
    
- **Pannonian Plain, Hungary/Serbia** – Central European steppe‑prairie mix with agriculture and national parks.
    
- **Canterbury Plains, New Zealand** – Flat grasslands and farmland on the South Island.
    
- **Highveld grasslands, South Africa** – Upland plateaus with sweet grasses used for livestock and maize.
    
- **Manchurian grasslands, China** – Cool temperate grasslands once grazed by horses and cattle.
    

**When to use this**

- Place prairies in temperate interiors of continents, often east or downwind of major mountain ranges where rainfall is moderate and soils are deep.
    
- They typically form belts between forested regions (wetter) and semi‑arid steppe or shrublands (drier)[animalia.bio](https://animalia.bio/temperate-grasslands#:~:text=Temperate%20grasslands%2C%20savannas%2C%20and%20shrublands,types%20of%20species%20found%20here).
    
- Fires and grazing maintain grass dominance; without disturbance, prairies can succeed to forest in wetter climates.
    
- Human settlement is concentrated and prosperous due to fertile soils; these lands support large populations and significant agriculture.
    
- Use prairies when you want a productive, open landscape with expansive vistas and a strong agricultural base.
    

### Steppe

**Short description**: Cool, semi‑arid grasslands dominated by short grasses and shrubs. They occupy interiors of continents far from moisture sources.

**WWF category**: Temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands

**Vibes**

- Endless, slightly colour‑washed grasslands of short bunchgrasses and hardy shrubs rather than lush prairie.
    
- Huge skies and long, rolling horizons; you can see trouble coming… but it can also see you.
    
- Weather is dramatic: hot, dusty summers; bitter, windy winters; big temperature swings and fierce storms.
    
- Nomads and herds define the human footprint: horses, hardy cattle, sheep or goats and the camps and caravans that follow them.
    
- Fire and wind are major characters—grass fires sweep across in dry seasons and gales howl across the open plain.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Short, drought‑tolerant grasses and low shrubs adapted to semi‑arid conditions[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers).
    
- **Common fauna**: Wild horses and saiga antelope, small burrowing rodents, steppe eagles and vultures; predators include wolves and foxes[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=Steppes%20are%20semi,20%20inches).
    
- **Conditions**: Annual precipitation is generally between 25 cm and 50 cm[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers); winters are cold and summers can be hot, with strong winds and wide temperature ranges.
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low; the open landscape favours nomadic or semi‑nomadic pastoralists and scattered trading posts.
    
- **Agriculture**: Limited dryland farming of hardy cereals like millet or rye; most cultivation occurs in river valleys or with irrigation.
    
- **Resources**: Extensive grazing lands for livestock; trade routes connecting distant regions; potential for mineral resources (oil, gas, coal) and wind power.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Eurasian Steppe, Ukraine/Kazakhstan/Mongolia** – The classic steppe where horse‑riding nomads have roamed for millennia.
    
- **Mongolian Steppe, Mongolia** – Rolling grasslands supporting yurt‑dwelling herders and wild takhi horses.
    
- **Pontic–Caspian steppe, Russia** – Semi‑arid plains between the Black and Caspian seas, historically a corridor for migrations.
    
- **Patagonian steppe, Argentina** – Cool, windy grasslands east of the Andes with sheep ranching.
    
- **Wyoming Basin high plains, USA** – Sagebrush steppe with pronghorn and mineral extraction.
    
- **Daurian steppe, China/Mongolia** – Semi‑arid grassland hosting cranes and antelope, threatened by desertification.
    

**When to use this**

- Place steppe landscapes in continental interiors far from oceans, often in the rain shadow of major mountain ranges.
    
- These regions have temperate, semi‑arid climates with cold winters, hot summers and modest rainfall (25–50 cm)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/steppe/#:~:text=A%20steppe%20is%20a%20dry%2C,cold%20winters%20and%20warm%20summers).
    
- Grasses cover the ground, but trees occur only along rivers or sheltered north‑facing slopes; much of the landscape feels dry, wind‑scoured and open.
    
- Steppes often form belts between wetter prairies and true deserts; moving downslope or closer to moisture yields prairies, while moving further into the rain shadow leads to semi‑arid or arid deserts.
    
- Human use revolves around pastoral rangeland, long‑distance overland routes and nomadic cultures; a “horse nomad country” feel indicates steppe.
    

### Open Highlands

**Short description**: High‑elevation plateaus or broad uplands with cool climates and open grasslands or shrublands rather than forest.

**WWF category**: [Montane grasslands and shrublands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands)

**Vibes**

- Wide, windswept plateaus covered in tussock grasses and flowering shrubs; few or no trees.
    
- Cool days and cold nights; frost is common even in summer.
    
- Herds of grazing animals dot the landscape, moving in long lines along game trails.
    
- Views stretch across adjacent valleys and mountain ranges; thunderclouds build quickly over distant peaks.
    
- A sense of isolation mixed with openness – travellers can see for miles but must contend with sudden storms and thin air.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Tufted grasses, cushion plants and low shrubs adapted to cool, wet conditions; giant rosette plants such as _Lobelia_ and _Puya_ may be present in tropical examples[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands#:~:text=Montane%20grasslands%20and%20shrublands%20are,3).
    
- **Common fauna**: Grazing ungulates such as vicuñas, Tibetan antelope and mountain cattle; predators like snow leopards or eagles; ground‑dwelling birds and rodents that burrow to escape the cold[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands#:~:text=Montane%20grasslands%20and%20shrublands%20are,3).
    
- **Conditions**: High‑elevation climates are cool to cold with intense sunlight. Rainfall can be moderate, but soils are thin and drainage is poor; many species have waxy leaves or rosettes to conserve moisture[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_grasslands_and_shrublands#:~:text=Montane%20grasslands%20and%20shrublands%20are,3).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low, with scattered pastoral communities or fortified villages on sheltered ridges.
    
- **Agriculture**: Limited cultivation of hardy crops such as barley or potatoes; primary use is grazing of sheep, goats, camels or llamas.
    
- **Resources**: Pasture for livestock, medicinal plants, high‑altitude springs and rivers, and mining of minerals such as gold or copper.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Tibetan Plateau high grasslands, China** – Expansive yak pastures interspersed with alpine lakes under an intense blue sky.
    
- **Andean puna, South America** – Cold, grassy uplands with rosette plants and herds of vicuñas and alpacas.
    
- **Ethiopian Highlands, Ethiopia** – Upland moorlands with Afro‑alpine vegetation and endemic species like the gelada baboon.
    
- **Drakensberg highlands, South Africa** – Rolling montane grasslands on basalt plateaus, rich in endemic flowers.
    
- **Scottish Cairngorms plateau, UK** – High moorlands with heather, boggy patches and reintroduced wildcats.
    

**When to use this**

- Place open highlands on elevated plateaus or broad, gentle slopes between forested foothills and alpine peaks.
    
- These areas experience cool summers and cold winters but support extensive grasslands rather than tundra; rainfall may be moderate, producing lush pastures during the growing season.
    
- Open highlands often form transitional zones between dense forests at lower elevations and alpine tundra or glaciers above.
    
- Human presence centres on pastoralism and small fortified towns guarding passes; agriculture is secondary to grazing.
    
- Choose open highlands when you need a high, windswept steppe‑like landscape with cooler temperatures and a sense of remoteness.
    


## Wetlands

Wetlands are waterlogged landscapes where the soil is saturated either seasonally or permanently. They range from acidic peat bogs to lush marshes and forested swamps.

### Bog

**Short description**: A nutrient‑poor, acidic wetland where peat accumulates from decaying sphagnum moss and other plants. Bogs develop in cool, poorly drained conditions.

**WWF category**: [Bog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog)

**Vibes**

- Spongy, peat‑filled ground that trembles underfoot; pools of dark, tannin‑rich water reflect an overcast sky.
    
- Low shrubs and mosses dominate; carnivorous plants dot the landscape like gems in the moss.
    
- Mist often hangs over the bog, muffling sound and giving the place an eerie, timeless quality.
    
- Few trees break the horizon; the air smells of damp earth and decaying vegetation.
    
- A sense of isolation; travellers must tread carefully or risk sinking into hidden pools.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Sphagnum moss carpets the surface; low shrubs like heather, dwarf birch and cranberry; sedges and grasses; carnivorous plants such as sundews and pitcher plants thrive in the nutrient‑poor conditions[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=A%20bog%20is%20a%20freshwater,the%20most%20recent%20ice%20age)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=Bogs%20are%20ecologically%20important%20because,heather%20are%20common%20bog%20plants).
    
- **Common fauna**: Insects (dragonflies, mosquitoes), amphibians, small mammals (voles, shrews), and birds such as snipe and cranes feed and nest here[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=Bogs%20are%20ecologically%20important%20because,heather%20are%20common%20bog%20plants).
    
- **Conditions**: Bogs form where water accumulates and drainage is poor, often in glacial depressions; peat builds up over centuries, making the environment acidic and nutrient‑poor[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=A%20bog%20is%20a%20freshwater,the%20most%20recent%20ice%20age).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Very low; people avoid bogs except for seasonal resource gathering.
    
- **Agriculture**: Minimal; peat soils are unsuitable for cultivation and can be dangerous to traverse.
    
- **Resources**: Peat is harvested for fuel or horticulture; berries (cranberries, cloudberries) and sphagnum moss for medicinal uses; bogs act as carbon sinks and water storage.[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=Bogs%20are%20ecologically%20important%20because,heather%20are%20common%20bog%20plants)
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Vasyugan Swamp, Russia** – One of the world’s largest bogs, covering thousands of square kilometres of western Siberia.
    
- **Clara Bog, Ireland** – Peatland with boardwalks for visitors, showcasing carnivorous plants and rare dragonflies.
    
- **Rannoch Moor, Scotland** – A bleak, boggy moor with lochans and heather, used as a training ground for soldiers.
    
- **Pine Barrens, New Jersey, USA** – Acidic wetlands with cranberry bogs and dwarf pines.
    
- **Kainuu peatlands, Finland** – Extensive raised bogs with cloudberries and reindeer grazing on surrounding uplands.
    
- **Terra Nova National Park bog, Canada** – Spongy peatlands interspersed with black spruce and larch.
    

**When to use this**

- Place bogs in cool to cold climates where precipitation is high and drainage is poor, such as glaciated landscapes or upland basins[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/bog/#:~:text=A%20bog%20is%20a%20freshwater,the%20most%20recent%20ice%20age).
    
- They often occur adjacent to forests or tundra and can form mosaics with fens, marshes or wet meadows.
    
- The ground is waterlogged and acidic; travel is slow and hazardous, and settlements are absent.
    
- Use bogs to evoke a bleak, misty atmosphere, perhaps hiding secrets or serving as a barrier to travel.
    
- They can also provide resources like peat and berries, adding a reason for occasional human visits.
    

### Mangroves

**Short description**: Intertidal forests of salt‑tolerant trees and shrubs growing along sheltered tropical and subtropical coasts. Mangroves thrive in salty, oxygen‑poor soils.

**WWF category**: [Mangrove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove)

**Vibes**

- A maze of tangled roots rising above muddy water; the forest appears to float on stilts.
    
- The air is warm and humid, filled with the sound of popping bubbles, buzzing insects and the splash of fish.
    
- Muddy channels snake between stands of mangroves; glimpses of crabs scuttle among roots.
    
- Sunlight filters through glossy green leaves, reflecting off brackish water; the smell is a mix of salt, decay and life.
    
- A sense of hidden abundance; everything feels teeming, yet the land and sea blur together.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Mangrove species such as _Rhizophora_, _Avicennia_ and _Bruguiera_ with specialized aerial roots and salt‑filtering systems[ocean.si.edu](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/mangroves#:~:text=Mangroves%20are%20survivors,the%20impact%20of%20human%20activities).
    
- **Common fauna**: Fish and crustaceans using the roots as nurseries, reptiles like crocodiles, snakes and monitor lizards, birds such as herons and egrets, and monkeys or mudskippers in some regions[ocean.si.edu](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/mangroves#:~:text=Mangroves%20are%20survivors,the%20impact%20of%20human%20activities).
    
- **Conditions**: Mangroves occupy intertidal zones where freshwater mixes with seawater; soils are waterlogged and low in oxygen, requiring specialized root adaptations[ocean.si.edu](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/mangroves#:~:text=Mangroves%20are%20survivors,the%20impact%20of%20human%20activities).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low to moderate; fishing villages and stilt houses sit on firm ground or artificial mounds.
    
- **Agriculture**: Unsuitable for conventional crops; some shrimp farming or salt evaporation pans may occur on cleared edges.
    
- **Resources**: Fish, crustaceans and shellfish; honey from mangrove flowers; timber and fuelwood; tannins; coastal protection from storms and erosion[ocean.si.edu](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/mangroves#:~:text=Mangroves%20are%20survivors,the%20impact%20of%20human%20activities).
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Sundarbans, India/Bangladesh** – The world’s largest mangrove forest, home to Bengal tigers and a rich fishing culture.
    
- **Everglades mangroves, Florida, USA** – Mangrove islands and channels supporting manatees and crocodiles.
    
- **Mekong Delta mangroves, Vietnam** – Dense mangrove stands protecting river mouths and supporting shrimp farms.
    
- **Red Sea mangroves, Egypt/Sudan** – Small but resilient mangrove clusters along hypersaline coasts.
    
- **Niger Delta mangroves, Nigeria** – Vast mangrove swamps threatened by oil development.
    
- **Socotra mangroves, Yemen** – Isolated stands on a remote island harbour unique species.
    

**When to use this**

- Use mangroves along sheltered tropical and subtropical coastlines where rivers meet the sea or in estuaries, lagoons and tidal flats[ocean.si.edu](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plants-algae/mangroves#:~:text=Mangroves%20are%20survivors,the%20impact%20of%20human%20activities).
    
- They require brackish water, gentle wave action and flat topography; avoid placing them on high‑energy coasts with strong surf.
    
- Mangroves form natural buffers against storms and tides; human settlements may cluster nearby for fishing and protection.
    
- They transition into coastal rainforests or dry forests inland and into seagrass meadows and coral reefs offshore.
    
- Include mangroves when you want a unique, water‑land interface teeming with life and used by fishing communities.
    

### Swamp

**Short description**: Permanently or seasonally flooded forests dominated by water‑tolerant trees. Swamps can be freshwater (cypress swamps) or saltwater (mangrove swamps).

**WWF category**: [Swamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp)

**Vibes**

- Dark, slow‑moving water glides among buttressed trees; moss hangs from branches and sunlight filters through a green canopy.
    
- The air is thick with humidity, buzzing insects and the croaks of frogs; the smell is earthy and slightly stagnant.
    
- Fallen logs and root knees create obstacles; movement is by canoe or along raised boardwalks.
    
- Wildlife thrives: turtles bask on logs, alligators lurk silently, and herons stalk along the water’s edge.
    
- A sense of secrecy and hidden dangers; the swamp feels ancient and alive.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Water‑tolerant trees such as bald cypress, mangrove (in saltwater swamps), tupelo and willow; the understory is composed of shrubs, ferns and aquatic plants[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=A%20swamp%20is%20an%20area,freshwater%20swamps%20and%20saltwater%20swamps)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=Freshwater%20Swamps).
    
- **Common fauna**: Amphibians (frogs, salamanders), reptiles (crocodilians, snakes), wading birds (herons, egrets), mammals (beavers, otters, raccoons) and fish[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=A%20swamp%20is%20an%20area,freshwater%20swamps%20and%20saltwater%20swamps).
    
- **Conditions**: Swamps are saturated for much of the year; water may be fresh or brackish. Trees root in standing water and soils are anaerobic[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=A%20swamp%20is%20an%20area,freshwater%20swamps%20and%20saltwater%20swamps).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Very low. Some communities build on natural levees or artificial mounds, but swamps are largely uninhabited.
    
- **Agriculture**: Limited; raised fields or floating gardens are possible but challenging; fishing is often more important.
    
- **Resources**: Timber (cypress, mangrove), fish, shellfish, alligator or crocodile skins, and flood control and water purification services[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=Freshwater%20Swamps).
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia/Florida, USA** – Blackwater swamp with cypress and gum trees, home to alligators and black bears.
    
- **Florida Everglades (cypress domes), USA** – Freshwater swamps interspersed with sawgrass marshes.
    
- **Congaree National Park, South Carolina, USA** – Old‑growth bottomland hardwood swamp with towering cypress and tupelo trees.
    
- **Pantanal, Brazil** – Seasonal floodplain with forested areas that become swampy during the wet season.
    
- **Niger Delta swamp, Nigeria** – Complex freshwater and brackish swamps intersected by rivers and tidal channels.
    
- **Mekong Delta freshwater swamps, Vietnam** – Seasonally flooded forests supporting fish and bird life.
    

**When to use this**

- Place swamps on low‑lying floodplains and deltas where rivers slow, spread and deposit fine sediment[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=A%20swamp%20is%20an%20area,freshwater%20swamps%20and%20saltwater%20swamps)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/swamp/#:~:text=Freshwater%20Swamps).
    
- They form behind natural levees or in shallow basins; water can be fresh or brackish depending on tidal influence.
    
- Swamps often lie between drier uplands and open marshes or open water; they may transition into mangroves along coasts.
    
- Human presence is sparse due to difficult terrain; resource extraction, fishing and travel by boat are common.
    
- Use swamps when you need a dense, water‑filled forest that acts as a natural barrier or holds hidden creatures.
    

### Marsh

**Short description**: Grassy wetlands frequently inundated with shallow water. Marshes are dominated by herbaceous plants and lack large woody vegetation.

**WWF category**: [Marsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh)

**Vibes**

- Open, gently undulating water dotted with islands of reeds and cattails; birds call and splash across the shallow pools.
    
- The air is humid and filled with the hum of insects; frogs chorus at dusk and dawn.
    
- In summer, the marsh buzzes with life; in winter, it may freeze or dry, exposing mudflats.
    
- Wide horizons give a sense of openness; sunsets paint water and reeds in brilliant colours.
    
- Water levels rise and fall with seasons or tides; pathways are often boardwalks or boats.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Emergent soft‑stemmed plants such as cattails, bulrushes, reeds, sedges and grasses[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#undefined#:~:text=Description%20of%20Marshes)[education.nationalgeographic.org](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/marsh/#:~:text=A%20marsh%20is%20a%20type,grasses%20and%20other%20herbaceous%20plants).
    
- **Common fauna**: Waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans), wading birds (herons, storks), amphibians, fish, insects and mammals like muskrats and otters[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#undefined#:~:text=Marshes%20recharge%20groundwater%20supplies%20and,nitrogen%20and%20phosphorus%20from%20fertilizer).
    
- **Conditions**: Marshes form in low‑lying areas with shallow standing water; soils are waterlogged but nutrient‑rich; water levels fluctuate seasonally[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#undefined#:~:text=Highly%20organic%2C%20mineral%20rich%20soils,44%2C%20vernal%20pools%20and).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Low. Settlements sit on natural levees or artificial mounds around the marsh perimeter.
    
- **Agriculture**: Some marshes are converted to rice paddies or hay meadows; others provide grazing in dry seasons.
    
- **Resources**: Fishing, wildfowl hunting, reeds and grasses for thatching and weaving, and floodwater storage to reduce downstream flooding[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#undefined#:~:text=Marshes%20recharge%20groundwater%20supplies%20and,nitrogen%20and%20phosphorus%20from%20fertilizer).
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **Everglades sawgrass marsh, Florida, USA** – Vast marsh dominated by sawgrass and inhabited by alligators and wading birds.
    
- **Louisiana coastal marshes, USA** – Brackish marshes supporting migratory birds and fisheries.
    
- **Camargue, France** – Mediterranean marshlands famous for flamingos, white horses and rice cultivation.
    
- **Okavango Delta, Botswana** – Seasonal floodplain and marsh hosting diverse wildlife and seasonal lodges.
    
- **Danube Delta, Romania/Ukraine** – Extensive reed beds and channels teeming with fish and birds.
    
- **Poyang Lake marshes, China** – Seasonal wetlands critical for migratory cranes and fishing communities.
    

**When to use this**

- Place marshes along river floodplains, lake edges or coastal lowlands where water is shallow and flows slowly[epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/wetlands/classification-and-types-wetlands#undefined#:~:text=Highly%20organic%2C%20mineral%20rich%20soils,44%2C%20vernal%20pools%20and).
    
- They form where sediment accumulates and where periodic flooding maintains high water levels but allows herbaceous vegetation to dominate.
    
- Marshes often grade into swamps (if trees establish) or into open water; they can also be reclaimed for agriculture (rice) or hay fields.
    
- Human use is limited to peripheries; the interior is best accessed by boat or boardwalk.
    
- Use marshes to create open, watery landscapes rich in bird life and seasonal change.
    

## Settled Landscapes

These categories describe landscapes heavily modified by people. Fertile plains and mosaic farmlands support dense populations and complex economies.

### Agricultural Heartland

**Short description**: Broad, fertile regions intensively cultivated for crops. These are the breadbaskets of nations, with deep soils, reliable water and high population densities.

**Reference**: [Breadbasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadbasket)

**Vibes**

- A patchwork of fields in various stages of growth: green shoots, golden wheat, stubbled ground and fallow plots.
    
- Farmhouses, barns and grain silos break the horizon; smoke rises from chimneys and tractors rumble along tracks.
    
- Rivers or irrigation canals snake through the landscape, feeding canals and ditches.
    
- The air smells of freshly turned earth, hay and ripe grain; insects hum in summer.
    
- A sense of productivity and order, punctuated by seasonal festivals tied to planting and harvest.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Cultivated crops like wheat, barley, corn, soybeans, rice or vegetables dominate; hedgerows and woodlots may remain at field edges.
    
- **Common fauna**: Domestic animals (cattle, horses, pigs, chickens) are ubiquitous; wild species include mice, voles, songbirds and foxes; raptors hunt over fields.
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: High. Cities, towns and villages dot the landscape; roads and canals create a dense network.
    
- **Agriculture**: Intensive crop farming with rotation and irrigation; mechanization is common in more developed areas.
    
- **Resources**: Grain, vegetables, oilseeds, fruit, and fibre crops; secondary products include flour, beer, animal feed and biofuels.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **American Midwest Corn Belt, USA** – Rolling fields of corn and soybeans feeding global markets.
    
- **Ukrainian chernozem belt, Ukraine** – Deep, black soils producing wheat, sunflower and barley.
    
- **Ganges Plain, India** – Intensively farmed rice and wheat terraces supporting dense populations.
    
- **Nile Delta, Egypt** – Fertile alluvial soils used for grain and vegetable production for millennia.
    
- **Loess Plateau farmlands, China** – Terraced fields carved into loess hills growing millet and vegetables.
    
- **Po Valley, Italy** – Rich floodplain producing rice, corn, wheat and dairy products.
    

**When to use this**

- Place agricultural heartlands on broad plains, river deltas or loess plateaus with deep, fertile soils and adequate moisture[plainshumanities.unl.edu](https://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ag.001.html#:~:text=The%20Great%20Plains%20is%20an,reach%20markets%20around%20the%20world).
    
- These areas often coincide with floodplains where periodic flooding deposits nutrients; irrigation canals and reservoirs intensify production.
    
- The climate should support a long growing season; rainfall or river water must be reliable.
    
- Human settlement density is high, with networked towns and cities and a developed transport infrastructure.
    
- Use this biome to anchor major civilizations, supply food surpluses and create contested strategic regions.
    

### Rural Mosaic

**Short description**: A patchwork landscape of small fields, pastures, orchards, hedgerows and woodlots interspersed with villages and farmsteads. It represents traditional mixed farming.

**Reference**: [Hedgerow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgerow)

**Vibes**

- Irregular parcels of farmland bordered by hedgerows, dry stone walls or tree lines; no two fields are alike.
    
- Narrow lanes wind past cottages, ponds and mills; the scent of wood smoke and manure fills the air.
    
- Small patches of woodland, orchards and gardens break up the open fields; livestock graze in fallow plots.
    
- The sounds of daily life – children playing, tools clanking, roosters crowing – mingle with birdsong from the hedges.
    
- A sense of centuries of human habitation; the land feels lived‑in and layered.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: A mosaic of cereal crops, vegetables, fruit trees and pastures; hedgerows composed of hawthorn, hazel, willow and other shrubs form living fences[hvfarmscape.org](https://hvfarmscape.org/hedgerows/#:~:text=When%20we%20discuss%20%E2%80%9Chedgerows%E2%80%9D%2C%20we,wide%20strip%20of%20trees%20may)[hvfarmscape.org](https://hvfarmscape.org/hedgerows/#:~:text=As%20the%20Brit%20Oliver%20Rackham,arise%20through%20several%20different%20routes).
    
- **Common fauna**: Small mammals (hares, hedgehogs, voles), numerous songbirds, pollinators, bats and larger species like foxes or badgers thrive in the varied habitats created by hedges and woodlots[hvfarmscape.org](https://hvfarmscape.org/hedgerows/#:~:text=When%20we%20discuss%20%E2%80%9Chedgerows%E2%80%9D%2C%20we,wide%20strip%20of%20trees%20may)[hvfarmscape.org](https://hvfarmscape.org/hedgerows/#:~:text=As%20the%20Brit%20Oliver%20Rackham,arise%20through%20several%20different%20routes).
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate. Villages, hamlets and isolated farmhouses are interconnected by footpaths and roads.
    
- **Agriculture**: Mixed farming – grain fields, vegetable gardens, orchards and small pastures; crop rotation and composting maintain soil fertility.
    
- **Resources**: A variety of foodstuffs (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy), wood and coppice from hedgerows, honey from hedges, and small game.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **English bocage, United Kingdom** – Patchwork of hedged fields, woodlands and villages in regions like Devon and Dorset.
    
- **French bocage, Normandy/Brittany** – Fields bounded by earth banks and hedgerows, with orchards and dairy farms.
    
- **Tuscan countryside, Italy** – Rolling hills of vineyards, olive groves and fields interspersed with cypress rows and villas.
    
- **Japanese satoyama landscapes, Japan** – Traditional agro‑forestry mosaics integrating rice paddies, forests and villages.
    
- **Irish hedgerow farmlands, Ireland** – Dense network of hedges dividing small pastures and crop fields.

- Gentle terrain allows for small‑scale fields and varied land use; soils are fertile enough to support diverse crops.
    
- Hedgerows and woodlots provide habitat for wildlife and shelter from wind; their presence distinguishes this landscape from open prairies or large fields.
    
- Human population density is moderate; the landscape supports vibrant rural communities rather than large cities.
    
- Use this biome to evoke an old, well‑tended countryside full of variety and charm.


### Pasturelands

**Short description**: Managed grasslands and meadows used primarily for grazing domestic animals. They may develop on land unsuitable for intensive cropping due to slope, soil or climate.

**WWF category**: [Grassland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland) (cultural landscape)

**Vibes**

- Green meadows divided by hedgerows, stone walls or fences, dotted with livestock and haystacks.
    
- Rural tranquility with bells or bleats carrying across the hillside; gentle breezes ruffle grass and wildflowers.
    
- Rolling hills or valley floors with a patchwork of pastures interspersed with barns, farmhouses and small woodlots.
    
- Seasonal rhythms of hay cutting, lambing and cattle drives; human presence is visible but not urban.
    
- A sense of order and productivity tempered by the wildness of surrounding hills or moors.
    

**Ecology**

- **Dominant vegetation**: Grasses and legumes such as perennial ryegrass, clover and alfalfa, either planted or encouraged through grazing management[fao.org](https://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/spi/scpi-home/managing-ecosystems/management-of-grasslands-and-rangelands/grasslands-what/en/#:~:text=It%20is%20usually%20on%20land,It%20follows).
    
- **Common fauna**: Domesticated animals (cattle, sheep, goats, horses) are most conspicuous; native species like hares, foxes, hedgehogs and birds (larks, hawks) inhabit field edges and hedgerows.
    
- **Conditions**: Pasturelands occur in a range of climates but usually have sufficient moisture for grass growth; soils may be too shallow, stony or wet for crops.[fao.org](https://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/spi/scpi-home/managing-ecosystems/management-of-grasslands-and-rangelands/grasslands-what/en/#:~:text=It%20is%20usually%20on%20land,It%20follows)
    

**Human use**

- **Population & settlement density**: Moderate. Villages, farmsteads and hamlets dot the landscape; roads and paths connect fields to markets.
    
- **Agriculture**: Grazing of cattle, sheep, goats or horses is primary; hay and fodder crops are grown for winter feed.
    
- **Resources**: Meat, milk, wool, leather and manure; secondary products include cheese, hides and draft animals.
    

**Real‑world examples**

- **English pastoral countryside, UK** – Rolling fields bordered by hedgerows, dotted with sheep and cattle.

**When to use this**

- Place pasturelands where soils or terrain are unsuitable for intensive cropping but rainfall supports grass growth – valley bottoms, hillsides, plateaus or moorlands.
    
- They often occur adjacent to arable fields, forests or mountains, forming a mosaic of land uses.
    
- Pasturelands may serve as transitional zones between cultivated lowlands and wilder uplands or moors.
    
- Human presence is obvious through fences, barns, shepherd paths and small villages; these areas support rural economies.
    
- Use this biome when depicting settled yet pastoral regions with a strong livestock focus and moderate human density.
