**Blackwater Bridge:**
 
The town of Blackwater Bridge is a free market town in the Duchy of Arnsbury, on the upper reaches of the Semb. It is a crossroads, a walled town where goods, especially wool from the highlands, is traded downriver to Embry or overland to Arnsbury, and then on to Telham and Tollen where it is spun into fine linen and traded across the Green Sea.
 
The eponymous bridge spans the Semb here, and the road and bridge tolls are a major source of wealth for the town. The town is protected by a high stone wall, and constructed largely of timber and masonry buildings packed close together on narrow cobblestone streets.
 
The river is wide here, but there is little river traffic as both up and downstream of Blackwater Bridge the Semb is swift-moving and full of rapids as it descends through the rough highland plateau to the lowlands below.
 
The town is a crossroads: one major road follows the course of the Semb north towards Lake Derwent and the dwarven trade, and then continues downriver to the Duchy of Cheimin and eventually Embry. Another road leads from Arnsbury in the east to the highlands and sheepherding smallholds in the Aine Hills. It is this road, to the west, into the Aine Hills, that will be the scene of our adventure.
 
**Whitesparrow:**
 
On the edge of the Aine Hills sits the small market town of Whitesparrow, the ancestral home of Lord Whitesparrow and the Whitesparrow family. The Whitesparrow lands form a patchwork of small holds around the narrow valley of the Rushing River, a swift flowing tributary of the Semb that cascades down from the Aine Hills. This area of the highlands is best known for sheep and goat herding, and the spring markets after shearing are notable affairs. The regular weekly market also draws traders who are passing across the Aine Hills from Ardlas or the dwarven kingdoms beyond, and dwarves and halflings are common sights in town.
 
Whitesparrow is a town of about 500 people, largely peasants and shepherds in service of Lord Whitesparrow. It is an old town, an area that has been settled by people for generations uncounted, and the Whitesparrow family traces their ancestry back to before Sembara was even a kingdom. Although nominally a liege of the Sembaran King, the Whitesparrows function mostly independently.
 
The most notable feature in Whitesparrow is a huge, titanic, six-fingered hand that emerges from the ground on the outskirts of town. The people in town view this as a good luck charm, a sign of protection that they have lived under and with for generations. But rumors persist that the hand is hollow and a staircase leads somewhere deep underground, and a few attempts have been made over the years to dig it up.

As a stop on the modest trade route from Ardlas to Arnsbury, Whitesparrow also boasts more than a typical number of establishments catering to visitors, including two taverns, a blacksmith, a fletcher/carpenter, and a leatherworker.
 
The larger tavern, the Longbow and Goose, is a neat, spare establishment run by Reynard, a retired solider, adventurer, and mercenary. It is know widely for its excellent lamb stew and stout beer, as well as stories of far off places. Reynard is a quiet sort, but little misses his eye and he can be drawn out to talk at length about his travels in his former life.
 
The smaller tavern, the Half Pint Inn, is run by Dee Kettlesong, a distant cousin of Oona Kettlesong. Popular with halfling travelers, this tavern has a mix of rooms for "big folk" and "little folk", and typically has a bustling, crowded common room with song and dance. Known more for drink and cheer than food, this place caters to outsiders. Dee is cheerful, smiling halfling with broad shoulders and curly blonde hair; she greets Oona enthusiastically.
 
Also in town is the local Temple to the Wanderer, the patron of this town, and of course the keep and the market square.
 
The town is protected by wooden walls, but the gates typically stand open from sunrise to sundown, with a toll charged to enter for merchants on market day only. The giant hand stands at the entrance to town.
