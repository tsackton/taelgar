Begin in Blackstone Bridge, with the meeting with Oona Kettlesong.
 
Characters will gather at Westgate to meet Oona and begin their journey to Whitesparrow through the Aine Hills.
 
## Oona Kettlesong
 
Oona is a traveling merchant, trader, peddler, who plys the roads among the various small highland freeholds.
 
She has brought salt (from the coast), tea, honey, and salt fish; she also picked up some luxury leather goods (boots, belts) in Blackwater Bridge, and some coin; after Whitesparrow she will continue west to the dwarven kindgom of Khatridun where she will pick up finely crafted luxury goods, and return via Whitesparrow to Blackwater Bridge. A small route, but generally a pleasant one.
 
Oona’s Appearance  
Oona is of average height for a halfling, just under three feet  
tall. She is a bit plump and has a broad, friendly face framed  
by strawberry-blonde curls. The touch of gray in her hair  
suggests she is in her middle years. She wears simple traveling  
clothes but prefers bright, often clashing colors.
 
Oona’s Personality  
Oona is a typical halfling. She loves traveling, she loves  
meeting new people, and she follows her impulses rather  
than her reason. Her impulses have served her well, though,  
as she has got good business instincts. That said, she is  
not rich, and she knows she never will be. She is comfortable  
enough and she is far more interested in traveling and  
meeting people than in amassing wealth anyway.  
The long, lonely treks between different towns have been  
weighing on her though. She has had a few good years and  
she has got enough money that she can afford to hire a  
guard. Or two. Or five. In truth, she is less concerned about  
being protected than she is with having someone to talk to.  
And she is quite talkative.
 
Portraying Oona  
Oona is friendly and talkative. She is quite inquisitive. When  
you are speaking and acting as Oona, try to bring a bit of energy  
to it. But do not overdo it. Especially if you are running  
the game for new players. If you come on too strong, you can  
intimidate them. Oona will not force anyone to talk and she  
does not want to talk to anyone who does not seem to like  
her. But given any opportunity to chat, she will take it.
 
Oona’s Disposition  
Oona is generally friendly, and she hires the heroes to accompany  
her partly because she does not like traveling. alone. But that does not mean Oona has to keep liking the heroes. During the adventure, the heroes might do things to sour Oona’s opinion of them. These are called out as they occur in the module. While it is okay to disregard them, you should consider noting whenever the heroes do something Oona does not like and then adjusting your portrayal of Oona to match her opinion of the heroes. She will not withhold information from or sabotage the heroes, but she will act impatient, short-tempered, brusque, or grumpy.

# Traveling
 
The first few days pass through rolling hills dotted with farms and fields. Sheep are a common sight, and most nights you are able to find shelter in a friendly farmer's barn for the night in exchange for a little coin and food, which Oona supplies.
 
On the third day, you enter Silverpine Forest.
 
About Silverpine Forest  
Silverpine Forest is a heavy, mixed-growth forest that extends along the rough terrain of the Aine Hills. When you enter the forest, it is thick with broadleaf trees like willows, alders, poplars, and oaks interspersed with evergreen spruces and the whitebark pines from which the forest gets its name. In the uplands, where most of this part of the adventure takes place, the terrain consists of rough, forested hills. There are fewer shrubs and ground cover here, fewer broadleaf trees, and more evergreens.
 
The Silverpine Road is a narrow, dirt track. In a few places, there are just a pair of furrows left by the passage of countless carts in the weeds. The road winds back and forth, following the contours of the land. In the uplands, it climbs gradually upward, winding between steep hills, sometimes following steep bluffs or sheer, bare rock faces.
 
It is springtime. The broadleaf trees are bare or budding. The road is muddy from rain and snow melt. The party passes streams and rivulets frequently.
 
The forest’s natural fauna is active, but skittish and Oona’s cart is noisy. The party might see robins, sparrows, or finches in the trees or hear a woodpecker tapping away. They might startle a rabbit or pheasant or catch sight of a red deer darting away between the trees. At night, they might hear the cries of owls or night thrushes or the distant howls of wolves.￼

## Tutorial Encounters
 
Run one or more of B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6 from Fall of Silverpine Watch depending on people's familiarly with the game, time, etc.
 
If things are moving quickly, could skip some of this, perhaps improvise some encounters.
 
## Climax
 
The ambush and arrival at Whitesparrow.
 
Idea is to end with combat and then arriving at Whitesparrow, ending as they pull up to the giant hand and the walls and see the town on edge.
 
Basic premise is that a hobgoblin has shown up in town (or perhaps two), with bugbears and taken control of the local goblin tribe. While before the Brownleaf goblins were a minor nuisance, rarely killing anyone and mostly limiting themselves to the occasional sheep theft, now they are much more violent. And scared.
 
Idea is to play the goblins as kind of sympathetic in a way and basically caught in terror of their hobgoblin master.
 
Rosethorn, the former leader of the goblin tribe, just wants things back the way they were and will betray the hobgoblin if encouraged (although not fight, will just run).
 
## Ambush
 
The goal of the goblins here is to lure caravan guards to the dead horses, then sneak to wagon, jump on, toss a bomb, and have the two melee types ride off on the spooked horses while the archers retreat into the woods.
 
If the entire party advances and no one spots the sneaking goblins, Oona will jump off the wagon rather than be captured.
 
If the party drives off the goblins and immediately rests, try to end session there as they will likely return. Oona will encourage party to press on to Whitesparrow, which has walls and protection.
 
If they pick up their pace, they will get away but might run into a trap; if they go slower can find the trap but a few archers may follow and harass them. See how this goes and what time it is.
 
## Whitesparrow Approach
 
Come to town near dusk; few people out even in the open lands around the village, and those who are out seem to be hurrying towards town.
 
Gates closed, but Oona knows the guards and they let party in.
 
But probably end here.

## Question Ideas:
 
**Elven Cleric:**

- Don't see many elves in this part of the world; what brings you to human lands?
- That's a strange symbol you carry, is that one of the gods' symbols?
 
**Dwarf Fighter:**

- That maul you carry is almost as big as me! Where did you learn to use that thing?
- \<something about where from?\>
 
**Dwarf Wizard:**

- \<something about magic\>
- \<something about lore?\>
    
**NOTE:**
 
Make sure to foreshadow. Oona is hiring more guards than usual because no caravans have come south yet and it is far past time for the first wagons to have crossed from the west. She is nervous about dangers on the road, which has never been totally safe but seems suspicious now.
