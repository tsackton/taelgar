Starting at level 2, so most characters won't have a subclass yet.
 
Can be flexible on this, but designed around the following:  
Human Fighter -\> Battlemaster or Arcane Archer or Samurai  
Dwarven Fighter -\> Rune Knight, Champion, or Eldritch Knight  
Halfling Rogue -\> Scout or Mastermind probably but pretty flexible  
Halfling Bard -\> College of Lore or College of Eloquence  
Human Paladin -\> Oath of Glory  
Human Ranger -\> Hunter or Gloomstalker
