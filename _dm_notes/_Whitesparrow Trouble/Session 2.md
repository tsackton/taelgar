## Intro
 
- Remind them of the situation, set the scene as they approach the walled town of Whitesparrow late at night, the torchlight of the watchtowers the only fires in the dark sky. The giant hand looming over the road just outside the gate.
- Guards will hail them, "travelers, who is out on the road so late at night?"
    - If party doesn't reply, Oona will
    - Ultimately should get into town, get settled at the Half Pint Inn, introduced to Dee Kettlesong, Oona's distant cousin. Oona will start to talk up the party.
- Remind them of long rest mechanics
 
## Mission
 
In the morning, a commotion as news has reached the manor of the party's arrival and their success in getting a caravan through.
 
Lord Marin Whitesparrow, the oldest son of the current, elder Lord Whitesparrow, will arrive, impressed, and ask them to help the town. The Whitesparrows can make it worth their while if they ask, with goods or money if desired. Can go up to 300 (50 gp per person, a non-trivial fortune), although will initially offer 150 gp. He is desperate so won't take much haggling to get him to agree, but he'll be a bit put out by this.
 
Fancy fur cloak, nicely made boots, a thin golden chain around his neck on which hangs a pendant of the Wanderer, the local god that protects the town.
 
Can provide two potions of healing as well, in advance, from their supply, as well as any arrows or other things they need like that. Explain magic items.
 
Basically run the scene as improv, play Marlin as serious but good-natured ("call me Sir Marin, Lord Whitesparrow is my father"). He is relatively popular in town and has kept Whitesparrow safe for a long time, although this recent crisis is testing the faith of the townsfolk.
 
## The Town
 
They can then explore the town, asking around whomever they wish to speak to. If they are stuck with who to talk to first, Oona and/or Sir Marin will suggest they talk to Reynard at the Longbow and Goose, a former adventurer and traveler.
 
## Secrets and Clues
 
- The Brownleaf goblins have always been a threat to wagons and farmers along the roads leading to Whitesparrow. But the tribe has grown far more cunning, and brutal, in recent months.
- Once content with sloppy hit-and-run tactics, the Brownleaf goblins now lay complicated traps and cunning ambushes against travelers that few survive.
- Brownleaf goblins have recently conducted complex ambushes against large shipments of equipment, textiles, and coin.
- The goblins always seem to know which trade wagons contain the best goods.
- ==The Brownleaf goblins used to be a nuisance, yes, but they rarely killed anyone and were easy to buy off with a little grain or ale, and they did tend to keep the giant rats in check. (X)==
- ==An human scout named Ilundar came to Whitesparrow to seek the goblins’ lair. So far, though, he spends most of his time around the village and hasn’t found much of anything. (X)==
- ==Ilundar has been seen scouting around an old abandoned temple known as the Ivy Church.==
- One recent ambush forced a wagon into a bog where it became stuck. The wagon’s driver and guards were chased out of the bog by a fearsome troll.
- A few months ago, a group of hobgoblin raiders got past the western army and caused some chaos to the west before they were hunted down and all killed.
- The Brownleaf goblins are known to dwell in a squalid lair at Greendepth Caverns, but that place has been quiet over the past few months.
- ==An ancient tree at the heart of the Howling Wood was once known as the Bearded Man. In ancient times, folk worshiped the tree as the manifestation of one of the old gods, but it died long ago. Now its trunk has been hollowed out and is home to spirits and monsters.==
    - ==Drezo is the name of the Kestavan god that inhabited the tree==

## The Half Pint Inn
 
The smaller tavern, the Half Pint Inn, is run by Dee Kettlesong, a distant cousin of Oona Kettlesong. Popular with halfling travelers, this tavern has a mix of rooms for "big folk" and "little folk", and typically has a bustling, crowded common room with song and dance. Known more for drink and cheer than food, this place caters to outsiders. Dee is cheerful, smiling halfling with broad shoulders and curly blonde hair; she greets Oona enthusiastically.
 
## The Longbow and Goose
 
The larger tavern, the Longbow and Goose, is a neat, spare establishment run by Reynard, a retired solider, adventurer, and mercenary. It is know widely for its excellent lamb stew and stout beer, as well as stories of far off places. Reynard is a quiet sort, but little misses his eye and he can be drawn out to talk at length about his travels in his former life.
 
## The Temple of the Wanderer
 
A small temple of stone, it is not large but it is well-appointed and tended. The temple steward is Mera, a younger woman and a relative newcomer to town. She is an efficient organizer and curious about history, can tell them about the old gods a little bit, albeit with a disdainful eye. Will be super curious about Anvanya.
 
## Other Places in Town
 
One of the armorers/smiths should be a dwarf.
 
## Notable NPCs
 
**Zuvan**: A hobgoblin who arrived about a month ago fleeing the scene of battle of a failed raid by his clan from the mountains. Ashamed of his cowardice he decided to whip the local goblin tribe into shape and terrorize the human population. Will perfer to die in a blaze of glory than run again.
 
**Ilundar Sunspear**: Zuvan’s eyes and ears in Whitesparrow, the human scout Ilundar is sick of being poor and sees Zuvan as an opportunity to get rich. Ilundar regularly meets with Wiggletoes, Zuvan's second-in-command, at the Ivy Church to pass information  
to Zuvan. He has the statistics of a spy. He can be bribed or tricked, but not convinced by loyalty. If party talks to him, he'll be cagey, basically say the Lord if offering a hefty reward and he is going to be the one to get it, and stay out of my business, I work alone.
 
**Wiggletoes**: Zuvan's second-in-command, Wiggletoes has above-average Intelligence compared to most goblins. She is the enforcer who enacts Zuvan's will and is quite happy with the current circumstances of the tribe.
 
**Bib:** Once Rosethorn's friend and second-in-command, she toed the line when Zuvan took over but longs for the days she can go back to the much more peaceful, much less deadly minor banditry of before. She knows the goblins who will run rather than fight if given the chance and can help the party if convinced. Usually either travels with Wiggletoes or captains the guard outside the Bearded Man.
 
**Teblex the ‘Troll’**: A cowardly ogre named Teblex resides in a bog near Whitesparrow, and spreads the rumor that he is actually a troll so as to make himself sound scarier. Teblex works for Zuvan to scare away anyone trying to pursue or locate thegoblins. From Teblex, the characters might learn of the goblins’ former hideout at Greendepth Caverns, or their current lair at the Bearded Man.
 
## Combats
 
Probably shouldn't use more than 3 total as we won't have time. Some options:
 
1. Teblex's Bog. They probably shouldn't / won't fight the ogre himself, but if they do, add a swarm of rats or two to make it a bit more interesting.
2. Greendepth Caverns 1. If they investigate the body, will have to deal with the ochre jellies.
3. Greendepth Caverns 2. If it seems appropriate, could throw in another pack of rats perhaps with a swarm or two sniffing around the caverns, looking for food. Hobgoblins have no interest in rats and now the packs of giant rats the goblins fed are getting hungry and desperate.
4. Ivy Church. It would be a mistake for party to attack here, as they would face Wiggletoes, numerous goblins/bugbears, and probably Illundar
5. Bearded Tree guards. Archers, bugbear.
6. Boss Battle. Zuvan, bugbears, perhaps goblins depending on how they play it.

This is where Zuvan found and killed Rosethorn, after demonstrating his magical powers. He dumped Rosethorn's body in the waste pit, to be devoured by ochre jellies, and moved the tribe to a better lair.
 
A DC 12 Int (Arcana/Investigation) can reveal this is where a fire spell was used and a battle took place.

## Finale
 
Should be a hard fight, but be careful not to make it too difficult since they are still level 2.
 
First, there is the guards, who are a couple of archers, Bib (unless already turned, in which case replace with a bugbear), and a bugbear.
 
The, the throne room. Don't run the trap as written, though, have Zuvan be waiting and order goblins to attack. Can run a little monologue.

Should be an opportunity here to learn that some goblins are conflicted about this. Maybe they can see Bib hanging back if they sneak.

Should be signs that some goblins have been here since the fight. If they wait around could encounter Bib and learn that not all goblins like Zuvan.

## Throne Room

Area Aspects: Hooded figure on throne, huge etched leaf, hidden alcoves above the floor.
 
_A throne of twisted vines stands atop a raised dais of graying wood. A hooded figure sits on the throne, its eyes blazing with fiery light. The floor of the chamber has been etched and stained with a depiction of a single huge leaf._
 
This is Zuvan, who will order his guards to attack the party, laughing at them.
 
Improvise battle. Depending on whether they have turned Bib and convinced goblins to flee, this will be difficult or medium, but so it isn't a total pushover make sure to have a few loyal bugbears who can't be turned as backup.
 _Treasure_  

Hidden under the throne is a heavy ironbound lockbox, which contains the highest-quality loot from  
the goblin raids. The box is devilishly protected with both a mechanical and a magical trap. When the box is opened, tiny darts erupt from it to attack all creatures within 15 feet: +6 to hit; 2 (1d4) piercing damage. A creature struck by a dart must also make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a success.
 
At the same time, a magic rune inside the box unleashes a blast of fire equivalent to a burning hands spell. Any creature within 15 feet of the box must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. No visual cues give the traps away, but both can be identified with a single successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
 
Disarming the dart trap requires subtle manipulation of the box’s lid with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, while the magic trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
 
Treasure: The chest contains 204 gp that have been painted to look like copper pieces, as well as a small, ugly goblin doll with gleaming red eyes. Each of the doll’s eyes is a ruby worth 50 gp, while its stuffing conceals various gemstones worth a total of 132 gp.
 
The true nature of the coins and the doll can be discovered with suitable handling and a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
 
A nearby side chamber contains the other spoils of the goblins’ raids, including bolts of silk, barrels of ale and mead, dried meats, and farming equipment worth a total of 100 gp, which the town will be grateful to have back.
