 ## Intro
 
Vague sweep over Tollen - mention a few of the districts.
 
Battery with the fortifications, Skepwalk with shipbuilding, Aesganstrad with guilds and the clocktower, across the Tollen Bridge, the bustling Fiskurth with taverns and entertainment, then drifting past the markets of Bridgeward to the slums of Brooklawn among the smells of the tanneriers, to a quiet tavern, the Spotted Cow.
 
A large, round man, bald and dressed in fine robes, several rings on his fingers all decorated with gears and wheels, stands at the head of a table. Master Wymar.

Introduce the problem. Master Bernard was an eccentric man, some say a genius, but someone who  
rarely shared what he was working on. His great project in the last years of his life was a new clocktower, a monument to the guild, he was constructing with his own funds on the north edge of Aesganstrad, near [[Nordgate]] on the edge of the dwarven district.
 
He died 6 months ago, the clocktower nearly finished but for the face. Still, it strikes the hours, the bells sounding distant and muffled and hardly audible beyond the immediate plaza of the tower itself.
 
The guild of course tried to repossess the tower, but we could not stop it striking the hour, nor could we figure out how to access the tower itself.
 
Now rumors are spreading that the tower is haunted. We cannot have the good name of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Clockmaker's associated with a haunted clocktower, so this must be dealt with. But we are meeting here because if you fail, or unleash any kind of danger on the city, we will disavow all knowledge of you.
 
If you succeed, we will be in your debt for a change.
 
## Tower Neighborhood
 
The clocktower rises about 60 feet above a large squat building, overlooking a small plaza with a minor weekly market. The area is a mix of dwarven artisans, minor merchants, artisans. On the border of the dwarven area of [[Nordgate]] and the human-dominated and guild-centric Aesganstrad, it is a well-off, clean, and quiet part of the city that wants no trouble with ghosts.
 
Several people in the area probably knew Bernard, who was seen as an eccentric genius. Some can provide clues or information, improve from notes below.
 
## The Clocktower
 
The entrance is locked, but Master Wymar has given the party a key. The ground floor is living space, dead quiet. A kitchen / hall, a small study, a bedroom, servant's quarters, pantry / storeroom. There is little of value here (all recovered by the guild).
 
Notes in the study can be found, improv from info below.
 
The tower itself is tricky to access. The upper level (60' up) has a balcony, so scaling the tower is one option. There is a door that leads to the staircase, but the stairs are invisible, so when you open the door it simply looks as if you are ascending into nothing. There are numerous gear diagrams on the wall.
 
Fiddling with the gears can come up with a way to reveal the stairs. Or of course you can just walk up -- but there is a missing stair that will be at trap.
 
## Tower
 
The clocktower has two levels. The stairs ascend to a workshop, and then beyond that another set of stairs climbs to the clockwork mechanism.
 
Bernard is trapped in the workshop as a ghost of sorts, stuck here until his clock is completed or he is banished or killed. He will be poltergeisty at first, possibly try to possess someone.
 
## Bernard
 
Bernard was an eccentric genius, and was trying to come up with a new clock mechanism. At the end of his life, frustrated that his work was not progressing, and feeling like he was stuck, he made a deal with an agent of chaos (improv but based on a strigoi but with some kind of chaos-like abilities).
 
But Bernard tried to renege on his deal. Now he is stuck here, his soul trapped, the demon also trapped unable to return to Limbo with the soul he was supposed to claim.
 
Resolution is basically to either kill the strigoi and help Bernard finish the clock, kill Bernard and damn his soul, or figure something else out.
