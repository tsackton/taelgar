There is a dwarf who has become corrupted via magic runes to be a servant of the Goddess of the End (the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik, two of the Void Minds). He is totally hollowed out – there is nothing left to save, and the original dwarfs mind is completely gone, replaced by a terrifying aberration that wants to summon a reduced threat Nightmare Beast ([https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2506156-nightmare-beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2506156-nightmare-beast) but with something a little less terrifying than the disintegration gaze - maybe DC16 8d8 psychic damage)


Where is he doing this: in a warehouse/outbuilding that is enchanted to be non-discoverable

  

How is he doing this: murder, gruesome murder. He is feeding some kind of magic brains, hearts, etc - destruction and end of what makes a person themselves. The worse they are when they die, the stronger it makes things. Basically the vibe is “the worst possible end”

  

When: 7 murders. Hardish to summon his hunters though. So basically maybe 7 nights, maybe more. Strong enough to succeed almost every night though.

  

How do PCs win?

- Figure out dwarf is murderer and deal with him (lair becomes obvious at that point, potentially still adventure if needed for timing/story, or could be more of an epilogue)
    
- Discover lair and deal with it (he will come to defend it)
    
- Let nightmare beast be summoned and kill it (dwarf will be obvious once it happens)
    
- Prevent murders - can be a standstill, but the source of power doesn’t really fade without new murders, it just doesn’t get stronger - so becomes a slog and they will eventually slip up…
    

  

Forks:

- If PCs find bad guy very fast, make lair into a bit of an adventure/dungeon crawl
    
- If they do not find bad guy very fast, lair is “final encounter” but not really a dungeon crawl
    

  
  

Needs 3 more for 7 total

  
  

Clue paths:

- Eva -> Felix -> Vistra -> charm stuff (vindication/trust of her will share fears of Darrak)
    
- Vistra -> suspicion of dwarf
    
- Amenisiac -> confirm dwarf is lying if she can remember
    
- T2/T3 -> T4 is not really storage?

Red herrings:

- Vistra/charm for first two 
    
- Bastien/inheritance for second two
    
- Hugo for all
    
- Amnesiac for all
    

  

Vistra via Eva/Felix

Bastien via rumors (??)

Hugo via Anna/rumors

Amnesiac via dwarf/rumors

  

Vistra

Notes/Secrets:

- Was charmed by caravan 3 and embarrassed by it
    
- Went to seem them at night when she realized it and confronted, had a disagreement with some of the guards but left
    
- Felix saw her sneak out but doesn’t know what she was doing
    
- Believes something is strange about Darrak Deepmine but not sure exactly what
    

  

Roland/Pierre

Notes/secrets:

- Was possessed when he died. Pierre was sleeping with him. He just lay down and let the creatures tear him apart, Pierre was left to watch, no one seemed to care
    
- Pierre was terrified/ashamed of this
    
- Roland bi, Pierre gay but had 1 child with Lisette (unacknowledged)
    
- Happy triad but really Roland held it all together. Lisette and Pierre like each other well enough but both were in love with Roland, not so much each other
    
- Did not really want Basiten to take over, and in fact both Roland and Pierre wanted Giselle and Matthieu to be the next innkeepers
    
- Were preparing to discuss change of ownership and cutting out Bastien
    

  

Lisette:

- Blames Pierre but mostly keeping it to herself
    
- Wants Bastien to take over (Cedric, the 2nd son, is easy going and just wants to stay out of family politics, not massively relevant here)
    
- Sad, furious, griefstriken
    

  

Eva:

- In love with Felix, secret affair. Not unknown if ask around
    

  

Felix:

- See Vistra. Suspects her somehow but not really sure how/wy
    

  

Nicholas

- Not really talkative but if approached the right way (need to think about what he wants) will admit that he has been having dreams about the houses, especially the lair, cracking open
    

  

Annais Chavert

- Suspects Hugo

Kiya

- Nicholas

Starts at wake. Each PC should have one false clue, one irrelevant fact, and one real clue.

  

Dan

- Meets Gis on road (clue)
    
- Hears about Tomas, who he knows a little bit and the story doesnt sound right
    
- Goes to town to investigate
    
- Knows Pierre / Lisette / Roland/ kids (red herring)
    
- Knows priest a bit (random person)
    

  

Chris

- Hears of Darrak Deepmine
    
- Heads that way to hear what he is up to
    
- Knows Vista a bit but mostly in a suspicious way
    
- Knows brewer
    
- Knows Joanne a bit but not in advance
    

  
  

Mine Plotline

  

- Roshan’s story – she tells about the entrance to the mine and seeing Darrak come out, but she doesn’t know a ton.  4-5 days from here
    
- The terrain to the mine is along a stream goes up a bit. Oak trees and grasses along the stream but dry otherwise. Not many people. Occasional goats
    
- Guisard household - main place they will encounter, about 3 days, maybe 4. Nearish the mine and is one of the few settlements in this part of the mountains
    

- Fortified, caves
    
- Run by Camille and Nicole, a young(ish) couple
    
- Five cousins and brothers: Henri, Aline, Simon, Lucas, Marc. Aline is missing
    
- Half a dozen farm hands: Colette, Juliet, Mariata, Oudine, Thierry. Two are missing (Colette and Oudine). 
    
- Two young kids: Carolina and George
    
- Shut out, either nothing or rumors
    

  

Mine Sequence: 4 levels. Bottom level has a maze-like tunnel. Room hard to find. When room found crack in floor, etc

  

Other stuff: prisoner room. Shaft.

**

- Why flee? Actually the leader has a bad habit of casting minor charms on people to get unreasonable deals. Vistra was so charmed, but is puzzled in the evening and confronted them. Didn’t know the two died (after confront) and fled in the morning, thinking that they had left (gay lovers, always talking about abandoning, no one in caravan cared, i.e. thought they had left and didn’t wait). Worried about charm. Vistra doesn’t want to say anything as she is embarrassed and also afraid to be accused.
