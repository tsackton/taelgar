## Types of Proficiencies 

There are three types of proficiencies: **Skill**, **Narrative**, and **Language**. Each type of proficiency has a different game effect. 

_Note_: This removes Tool proficiencies from the game entirely. The general ability to have flavor abilities is covered by narrative abilities. The able to specifically craft items in game uses the Craft skill.

**Skill** proficiencies allow you to add your Proficiency Bonus (or in some cases, twice your Proficiency Bonus) to a specific game action or situation, listed below. Typically the DM will inform you which Skill Proficiency you must use and ask for checks. Some skill proficiencies can apply to multiple ability scores.

_Note_: The Study action is an exception to the general rule about Skill proficiencies being used for game actions. The Study action always uses narrative proficiencies.

**Narrative** proficiencies allow you to add your Proficiency bonus to a narrative ability check. Typically you, the player, will ask to use this in appropriate situations after the DM tells you to make an ability check. 

Note that the Expertise trait can be used to improve a narrative proficiency instead of a skill proficiency.

**Language** proficiencies allow you to speak a language. There are three ranks of language proficiencies: 
* Broken, allows basic communication, but grants Disadvantage on Influence checks
* Proficient, standard ability to speak the language.
* Native, you are fluent and know the idiom well. Grants situational advantage on Influence checks and can be used as a Narrative proficiency for things related to the culture. Magic spells that grant language knowledge (i.e. Tongues) grant Native rank.

Each language rank has a cost in language points:
* Common Language, Broken: 1/3
* Exotic Language, Broken: 1/2
* Common Language, Proficient: 1
* Exotic Language, Proficient: 2
* Common Language, Native: 2
* Exotic Language, Native: 4

Each character chooses a single Native language based on their upbringing and gains a number of language points based on their species.

Broken proficiency in languages is generally expected to be learned in play. 
Two language points can upgrade 3 common languages, or 2 exotic languages, to proficient.

### Skills
The following skills exist. Note that some skills can occasionally be used with alternative ability scores (i.e. Influence (STR) might be used to intimidate someone with a show of force).

**Athletics** (DEX or STR). Physical ability. Used for grappling as well as feats of physical strength or agility. Merge of Acrobatics and Athletics. 
**Influence** (CHA). The ability to influence sentient creatures. Used specifically when trying to influence a sentient creature to do what you want. 
**Animal Handling** (WIS). The ability to influence non-sentient creatures. Used specifically for influencing a non-sentient creature to do what you want. 
**Insight** (WIS).  The ability to perceive emotions and body language. 
**Perception** (WIS). The ability to perceive the world.
**Stealth** (DEX). The ability to hide.
**Sleight of Hand** (DEX). The ability to manipulate small objects, pick locks, disarm traps, etc.
**Forensics** (INT). The ability to interpret what you can sense to decipher meaning, i.e. tracking, determining cause of death, etc. Combines parts of Investigation and Survival.
**Linguistics** (INT). The ability to understand and decipher languages you don't know. Primarily used to improve checks achieving broken understanding of a language you don't know.
**Craft** (DEX or INT). The ability to create items. The specific details of what you can create depend on your narrative proficiencies. Note that craft determines how well you can make things, not what you can make. 
**Art** (CHA or DEX). The ability to create art. The specific details of your art depend on your narrative proficiencies. 

All characters gain one skill proficiency from their background and one from their class at 1st level. Bards and Rangers gain a third proficiency, and Rogues gain a fourth. Multi-classing to Bard, Ranger, or Rogue grants a single proficiency.
#### Narrative Proficiencies
A narrative proficiency is a sentence like "My character is good at X because of Y" or "My character knows a lot about X because of Y". 

All characters gain two narrative proficiencies from their background, and one from their class at first level. 

Bards gain a bonus narrative proficiency at first level. This is typically related to their bardic calling.

All characters gain additional narrative proficiencies at 3rd, 9th, and 15th level. 

The following class features are modified

**Magician** and **Thaumaturge**. Grants a bonus narrative proficiency, instead of the ability to use Wisdom on Arcana checks.
**Thieves Cant** and **Druidic**. Removed.
**Jack of All Trades** allows you to apply half your proficiency bonus to all narrative ability checks.
**Skilled**. Grants two proficiencies, or one proficiency and expertise, or one proficiency and 5 language points.
#### Language Proficiencies
All characters start with a number of language points based on their species, as well as a native tongue. One narrative proficiency from a character background can be exchanged for 5 language points, as can the narrative proficiency earned at 3rd, 9th, or 15th level.

Rogues start with three bonus language points, and Druids with two.
