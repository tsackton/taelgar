Brainstorming some ideas about some ways to make the complex language development in Taelgar meaningful in play without being either (a) annoying to run at the table, or (b) too complex. 

### Languages as Tools

(adapted from a reddit thread)

One option is to treat language proficiencies like tool proficiencies. If you are proficient in a language, this includes more than just literal meaning of words, but also a kind of general sense of idioms and greetings and social norms. Then just apply the standard rules for tools:

 "If you have proficiency with a tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in the skill that’s also used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool proficiency on the same ability check."

In order to prevent this from being too strong, it would have to be limited in some way, otherwise one could interpret this as implying that you should have Advantage on all Charisma checks. Some obvious ways:
- Refactor languages into game categories that represent largish groupings of mutually intelligible dialects, and in-world categories that reflect the kind of real-world diversity of language gradients represented by e.g. medieval Europe. So rather than knowing "Sembaran", you'd know "Sembaran (Enst Valley)" or Sembaran (Isinguese). You can communicate with anyone who knows Sembaran, but only get the tool proficiency advantage if the dialects match. Still has the potential to lead to near-constant advantage in some cases. 
- Divide languages into something like language families and dialects. Some languages (Chardonian) are treated as broad, mutually intelligible language families that don't give you advantages. Others, like Tyrwinghan, may be treated as true in-world languages. You only get tool advantages for the "true languages". The logic is that you get a benefit for using a language that is otherwise rarely useful, but you don't get a benefit for knowing to speak the widely-spoken tongues. Encourages people to take rarer languages where normally most speakers would also speak Common and often something else, rather than just going for breadth. 
- Introduce language competency, perhaps something like native / fluent / trained or something. Only treat native as a "tool proficiency"; you start with one native language, and can give up a language to be native in more. Can never be native in trade tongues; can also split one language (fluent) into two languages (trained). Adds more complexity to character creation. 
- Could just use this as a way to trigger advantage when it makes sense. So if you are in Sembara, you speak Sembaran, everyone speaks Sembaran, there is no real advantage. But if you travel to Zimkova, and you are obviously an outsider, but you speak the language, it could help you. This is in practice probably similar to point 2.
