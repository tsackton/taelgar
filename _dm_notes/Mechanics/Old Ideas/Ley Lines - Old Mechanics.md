### Ley Lines

Because magic derives from the channeling of extraplanar energy, it can be affected by places and objects that bring the other planes in closer alignment with the realm of Taelgar. The Plane of Magic is the ultimate source of the arcane magic of wizards, bards, artificers, eldritch knights, arcane tricksters, and some warlocks and sorcerers, and the energy of the Plane of Magic spills over into the world of Taelgar in the form of ley lines, and in particular nodes, where ley lines cross.

#### Ley Line Mechanics

Any arcane caster can attempt to sense ley lines, although the subtle signs can be hard to detect. To sense ley lines, an arcane caster can concentrate for 10 minutes, focusing their awareness on the flow of magic around them. In a hurry, the caster can instead attempt to perceive ley lines as an action, which requires a spellcasting ability check against a DC set by the DM depending on the power, distance, and nature of nearby ley lines. At the DM's discretion, and depending on the circumstances, casters proficient in Arcana, Perception, or another relevant skill may add their proficiency bonus to this check. 

Although ley lines themselves do little more than feed the ambient energy that powers arcane magic, nodes can be sources of extra magical power. Any arcane caster can attempt to draw energy from a node, but this process is risky for those who haven't studied and trained in the methods of using ley lines represented mechanically by the Ley Initiate feat

To draw energy from a node, a caster must make a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 11 + level of the spell being cast. The result, depending on the check:

Fail by 4 or more: suffer backlash

Fail by less than 4: spell cast as normal

Succeed: gain bonus depending on node strength

Backlashes may include effects such as releasing a ley spirit of magical energy, which may be hostile, the spell producing only a harmless display of bright noise, temporarily incapacitating the caster, damage to the caster, or draining some of the caster's magical energy. 

Bonuses may include effects that empower your spell, such as increasing the level at which your spell was cast, increasing the duration, adding additional damage or minor conditions, or making it easier to maintain. Effects may also boost the caster, including gaining temporary hit points, arcane shields, and even restoring magical energy. The strength of the boost is dependent on the power of the node. 

A Note on Warlocks and Sorcerers

Warlocks and sorcerers draw their power from a variety of sources. While in some cases, these casters create magical effects via shaping the energy of the Plane of Magic, this is not always so. A shadow sorcerer or hexblade warlock, for example, may be more likely to rely on the inherent magic of the echo realms, in particular Shadowfell. Thus, the magic of these classes may be arcane / Plane of Magic, or more related to the divine or primal magic of other casters, depending on the source of their power. 

##### Sample Ley Line Tables

  

Backlash Table 

Roll on this table to determine the effect of a backlash. Unless otherwise noted, the spell you cast takes effect as normal.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The backlash overwhelms your mind. You act as if under the effects of the Confusion spell for the next minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 11 + level of the spell that triggered the backlash. On a success, the confusion effect ends.|
|2|Magical energies overwhelm you, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.|
|3|The energy of the spell is misdirected. If the spell involves attack rolls, they are made with disadvantage; if the spell involves saving throws, they are made with advantage. If the spell involves neither, roll again on this table ignoring this effect.|
|4|Magical static interferes with your spellcasting. For the next hour, any time you attempt to cast a spell, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.|
|5|The energies of the Plane of Magic strike against you. You take 2d6 force damage per level of the spell that caused the backlash, or 1d6 force damage if the spell was a cantrip.|
|6|The ley line consumes some of your magical energy. You lose one spell slot, which is the highest level you have available but not higher than 5th level, or the level of the spell that was cast plus 1, whichever is lower.|
|7|The backlash interferes with your magical items. All charged items in your possession lose 1d4 charges.|
|8|The ley line energies distorts your casting. The spell you intended to cast fails. Instead, you produce an effect from the wand of wonder or the wild magic surge tables, at the discretion of the DM.|
|9|The energy of the ley line overwhelms your casting, and the spell produces only a harmless display of bright color and loud noise.|
|10|A ley elemental spirit emerges from the node. This creature is chaotic and uncontrolled, and generally hostile to any arcane spellcaster.|

Minor Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a minor node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot one level higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +2 to AC until the start of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may reroll a number up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).|
|6|If your spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change the damage to one of the other listed types.|
|7|If the spell you cast involves one or more attack rolls, one attack roll of your choice is made with advantage.|
|8|If your spell affects multiple creatures, and forces them to make a saving throw, you may choose one target, who must make the saving throw with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to a target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or and knocked prone.|
|10|You regain one 1st level spell slot.|

Major Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a major node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier + twice the level of spell cast.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot two levels higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain 1d4 hit points per level of the spell you cast, plus your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +5 to AC until the end of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may choose up to two die rolls and replace them with the maximum value of the die.|
|6|If your spell deals damage, it ignores resistance, and creatures that are immune take half damage instead of no damage.|
|7|Magical energies swirl around you. You gain inspiration, which can be used to get advantage on one roll of your choice. This inspiration is lost once you use it, and otherwise lasts until you complete a long rest.|
|8|If your spell forces one or more targets to make a saving throw, that saving throw is made with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to one or more target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you, and knocked prone. Its speed is also reduced to 0 for the next minute. At the start of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw (against your spell save DC), ending the effect on success.|
|10|You regain one spell slot of your choice, which cannot be higher than level 3 or the level of the spell that was cast, whichever is lower.|
