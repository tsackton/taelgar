Monks of the Way of the Forceful Mind learn to manipulate the material world with the strength of their inner ki, allowing them to move objects and strike with unmatched force.
 
As a Monk of the Forceful Mind, you gain the following benefits:
 
**3rd level**
 
_Telekinetic Strike_. You can create a blast of force that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 force damage, plus an extra 1d10 force damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone, or pull the creature up to 20 feet towards you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t move it.
 
_Minor Telekinesis_. You learn the mage hand cantrip. You can cast it with no components, and for you the hand you create is invisible. You can also cast the _catapult_ spell by spending 2 ki.
 
**6th level**
 
_Telekinetic Glide._ You can cast _levitate_ by spending 3 ki points.
 
_Extraplanar Step._ You can cast _misty step_ by spending 3 ki points.
 
_Telekinetic Grasp._ You can cast _Maximillian's Earthen Grasp_ for 3 ki points. However, the summoned hand is invisible, and when you use your action to crush a restrained target, you may also spend 1 ki to make two unarmed attacks against the same target.
 
**11th level**
 
_Telekinetic Flight._ You can cast the _fly_ spell by expending 4 ki.
 
_Wave of Force._ As an action, you expend 4 ki and unleash of wave of telekinetic force in a 30 ft cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 force damage, and be pulled towards you or pushed away from you (your choice, but you must make the same choice for all creatures affected) 15 feet. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not moved. Unsecured objects completely within the cone are also moved. For each additional 1 ki point you expend, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance moved increases by 5 feet.
 
**17th level**
 
_True Telekinesis._ You can cast _telekinesis_ by expending 6 ki.
 
_Dimension Door._ You can cast _dimension door_ by expending 5 ki.
 
_Telekinetic Punch._ You can cast _steel wind strike_ for 6 ki, without requiring material components.
