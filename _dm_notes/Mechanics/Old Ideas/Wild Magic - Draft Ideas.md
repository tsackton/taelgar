## Triggering a Surge:
 
Every time you cast a leveled spell, roll a d20.
 
You trigger a wild magic surge if you fail against the wild magic DC. The default DC is 11, although environmental and situational modifiers may change the DC at the DM's discretion.
 
_Rational: A 5% chance of triggering is too low, but auto-triggering takes the wildness out of it. A 50% chance of triggering seems like a good compromise._
 
You add the following modifiers to the roll:  
-5 if you have used Tides of Chaos; if you are trying to trigger a surge you can let the magic run wild through you and subtract an additional -5 from your roll, but only if you have used Tides of Chaos.
 
_Rational: getting Advantage frequently is the main power of Wild Magic sorcerers, and this puts the ability to regenerate Tides of Chaos into the player's hands. If desired, they can essentially guarantee that it will be regenerated (unless the DM sets the DC away from the default for story reasons). But by making the default if the player desires, a surge will trigger, makes this less bound up on DM remembering to ask for a surge, etc._
 
+5 careful casting (can only do this out of combat and makes casting take longer, unless using subtle spell)
 
_Rational: Wild Magic sorcerers are certainly not overpowered at the moment, and many of the Surge effects can be beneficial in combat when enemies are around but are strictly bad out of combat. By giving the player an option to reduce the chance of a surge happening out of combat, this mitigates this a little bit._
 
At 14th level when you gain Controlled Chaos, you can also choose to add or subtract your spell attack modifier from the roll if desired. This is on top of careful/wild casting.
 
_Rational: As you get more powerful, you gain more control over magic and can affect whether you surge or not. By 14th level feels like you shouldn't be accidentally creating effects in situations when you don't want to, and also since you can control the effect to some extent, should be able to trigger one more or less at will if desired. Note this has more of an effect on preventing surges than triggering surges, because you can already trigger surges at will with Tides of Chaos and wild casting. However Controlled Chaos would let you trigger a surge at will even if you hadn't used Tides of Chaos, or if you were in a particularly stable area or situation with a higher DC for surging._

## Surge Table (d100):
 
_Odd numbers are Player's Handbook effects. Even numbers are new, but of equivalent power to the previous odd number._
