**Bonus Proficiency**  
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.
 
**Wrath of the Flame**  
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to scorch your foes. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
You can use this feature a number of time equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
 
**Touch of Fire**  
Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, small, non-magical fire (such as produced by a candle, coals, or a small campfire) does not harm you. In addition, you can use a bonus action to extinguish up to a 5' cube of non-magical flames that you can see within 60 feet, or to ignite a flammable object that fits in a 5' cube that you can see within 60 feet, as long as the object is not being worn or carried.
 
**Channel Divinity: Divine Inferno**  
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the flames of your Deity. As an action, you present your holy symbol and a fiery inferno bursts forth from you. All creatures you designate within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected. Creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
**Soul of Flame**  
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, when a creature within 30 feet of you takes fire damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of fire damage.
 
**Divine Strike**  
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
 
**Armor of Flame**  
At 17th level, your blessed affinity to fire becomes more powerful:

- You gain immunity to fire damage
- While you are wearing heavy armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from non-magical sources.

_Logic: This is supposed to be a martial, front-line fighter type cleric._

_Logic: Copies Tempest Domain, except that since fire damage is commonly resisted, add Touch of Fire which is basically a ribbon but has some nice thematic elements. Being able to create or extinguish flame, but not do damage, as a bonus action is probably only situationally useful, although it greatly increases the power of spells like Pyrotechnics._
 
_An alternative would be to drop Wrath of Flame entirely, and make Touch of Fire more like a super cantrip combining create bonfire and control flame._

_Logic: Copies Light Domain, except that since fire damage is commonly resisted, give close by things a disadvantage on the save._

_Logic: Merges Forge Domain and Nature Domain. 6th level ability for clerics typically defensive/buff._

_Logic: This is supposed to be a martial, front-line fighter type cleric._

_Logic: This is just the Forge Domain ability._

_Spell Choice Logic: Goal with Domain spells is 3-fold. First, keep the fire theme, but because fire damage is not always useful, throw in some radiant damage or other effects as well. Keep in mind synergies with Touch of Fire, which lets you create non-magical flame. Second, keep the melee theme -- this is not light domain, this is not a blaster, so spells that enhance melee should have preference. Third, grab some decent utility spells around fire from other spell lists._
 
_1st level: Searing Smite is an obvious choice and gives you access to a Divine-Strike-like ability at 1st level, plus can be upcast. A weak Paladin spell given competition with Divine Smite, but a strong Cleric spell. Burning Hands is a decent 1st level area of effect spell, and keeps melee focus because it can only hit things close to you. Could swap Burning Hands with Faerie Fire, which is a nice spell, but Burning Hands feels thematically more appropriate._  
_2nd level: Pyrotechnics is thematically awesome with Touch of Fire, and gives some good non-damage options. The second spell for this level was quite tricky. Considered Flaming Sphere, Continual Flame, Flame Blade, and Aganazzar's Scorcher. Flaming Sphere is nice and provides some battlefield control, plus gives you something to do with your bonus action. Continual Flame is thematically very appropriate but feels very weak, especially since it requires 50 gp material component that is consumed, and since it lasts until dispelled and is a Cleric spell you'd just cast this on an off day. Flame Blade is a nice idea, but competes with your smite (with a longsword, 2nd level smite does 1d8+2d6, while Flame Blade does 3d6, so why would you ever cast Flame Blade?). Aganazzar's Scorcher is very similar to Burning Hands, the area of effect is worse (a cone will hit more targets than a line), but the damage scales better (increases by 1d8 instead of 1d6, although at lower levels won't matter much as Burning Hands has 1 extra damage die when cast at the same level). I could see swapping Burning Hands for Aganazzar's Scorcher, but there isn't much choice at 1st level and there are a lot of nice fire spells at 2nd. Ultimately went with Heat Metal, from the Forge domain list. It is great for melee, as if you cast it on your opponent's armor, they are stuck with disadvantage, and if you cast it on their weapon, they are likely to drop it._  
_3rd: Stick with Forge Domain list here. May consider limiting to Fire only if needed for balance / theme but for now leave as is. Only tricky thing is these are both concentration, and since clerics don't get proficiency in Con saves you are going to be hurting to maintain this on the front lines, relying basically on not getting hit with high armor. Protection from Energy also partially replicates level 6th feature. Considered Blinding Smite here, but taking two smites feels like stealing too much from Paladin._  
_4th: Wall of Fire is an obvious choice. Considered Fire Shield, but it basically just replicates your 1st and 6th level abilities, so not too interesting. Elemental Bane is an interesting choice, since it helps mitigate resistance, but Con save + Concentration mean it may not stay up for long. A 4th level Searing Smite does 4d6 damage, which is exactly equivalent to Elemental Bane's extra 2d6 if the target is resistant, and much better if it isn't, plus only takes your bonus action. So you need to average several rounds of hitting for Elemental Bane to be any good at all. So it ends up probably never being worth casting. Ended up with Conjure Minor Elementals largely for lack of a better choice. But could consider Blinding Smite here, although it is a 3rd level spell the delay makes it a little less unbalanced with Paladins._  
_5th: Flame Strike is obvious, even though it is not a melee spell it is very nice thematically. Considered Conjure Elemental, but has downside of the elemental possibly turning on you if you lose concentration, and isn't so interesting with Conjure Minor Elementals. Considered Immolation or Dawn but they are very much distance blaster spells. Ended up with Holy Weapon by default, but it is nice and does radiant damage._
 
_Overall the list is quite combat focused, but this is not different from War Domain. Basically you end up using your Domain spells for combat and the rest of your spells for utility._
