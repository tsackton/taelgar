So a 4E monk is sort of intermediate between a 1/3 and a 1/2 caster. I think actually better to go closer to 1/2 caster in terms of progression, as using the same resource for spells and attacks
 
Also, spells should avoid single target take downs, as that is what stunning strike is for. Focus on AOE damage (otherwise a challenge for monks, although less so than other classes given flurry of blows), self buffs, and versatile things (e.g. fly).
 
Have limited options -- even at most generous (following the 4E revised) get max of 8 spells known, so should make sure there are no trap options.
 
At same time want to keep these distinct from base monk powers. Monks already get, roughly:
 
2nd level: haste-like effect (ki actions at 2nd give them functionally something like haste); longstrider  
4th level: feather fall  
5th level: hold person like effect (stunning strike)  
7th level: calm emotions  
13th level: tongues  
18th level: greater invisibility, astral projection
 
Some rough options
 
1. Elemental magic, basically a hybrid of 4E as written and 4E redux (keep ki costs same, give more disciplines)
2. Jedi: telepathy, telekinesis, maybe a bit of mind control / charm effects, effectively going for psionic type powers, plays well with ki being plane of consciousness magic
3. Divination focused, with some transmutation: challenge is there is not a lot of great spells that aren't a bit redundant, but could probably come up with something, and this could then tie into extraplanar stuff, contacting other planes/entities
4. Maybe some other options? Look at spells and kick around ideas in my head a bit, maybe think through some archetypes to develop? Simplest to build upon tropes….
