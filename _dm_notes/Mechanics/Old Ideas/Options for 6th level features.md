For Kenzo and Delwath
 
Ideas:
 
**Steps of Night**  
_6th-level Twilight Domain feature_  
You can draw on the mystical power of night to rise into the air. As a bonus action when you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically give yourself a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
   

**Channel Divinity: Read Thoughts**  
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature’s mind to command it.  
As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest.  
If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute.  
During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the **suggestion** spell on the creature without expending a spell slot. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.
 
**Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow**  
At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere.  
While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (**Stealth**) and Wisdom (**Perception**) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn’t visible outside it.  
The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.
 
**Shadow Step**  
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.
 
**Wings Unfurled**  
_6th-level Way of the Ascendant Dragon feature_  
When you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 additional ki point when you activate Step of the Wind to use this feature again.
 
**Extort Truth**  
At 6th level, you can hit a hidden cluster of nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to become mentally malleable. If you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 1 ki point to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes. You know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw.  
An affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.
 
**Mystical Erudition**  
Beginning at 6th level, you’ve undergone extensive training with the Cobalt Soul, teaching you extensively in history or lore from the monastery’s collected volumes. You learn one language of your choice, and you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: **Arcana**, **History**, **Investigation**, **Nature**, and **Religion**. If you already have proficiency in one of the listed skills, you can instead choose to double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.  
You gain an additional language and an additional skill proficiency from the above list (with the ability to double the bonus of an existing proficiency from the list) at 11th and 17th level.
 
**Clench of the North Wind**  
You can spend 3 ki points to cast **hold person**. _(6th Level Required)_
 
**Ethereal Step**  
At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the **etherealness** spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
 
**Hound of Ill Omen**  
At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the **dire wolf** statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C in the Player’s Handbook), with the following changes:

- The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.
- It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.
- It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.

The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.  
**Misty Escape**  
Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn **invisible** and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain **invisible** until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  
**Elemental Gift**  
_6th-level Genie feature_   
You begin to take on characteristics of your patron’s kind. You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron’s kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).  
In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  
**Writhing Tide**  
_7th-level Swarmkeeper feature_   
You can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are **incapacitated**.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
                  

## Delwath
 
Mike's idea was Fey Escape, but I kinda feel like that is a bit useless for a melee warlock. Maybe something like:
 
**Shadow Blur**
 
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force them to roll again, using whichever roll is worse and potentially turning a hit into a miss.  
Or, dodge as a bonus action prof mod per day?  
Except, that ends up being less useful once you get Armor of Hexes, and it doesn't give a lot of extra versatility; the design of accursed specter is a damage boost but also a semi-familiar, albeit one that you don't regularly have control over as you need to slay a humanoid first.  
Shadow Hound from UA  
Summon different creature, shadowhound, uses either dire wolf or tiger stat block, lasts for an hour, obeys your commands but cannot speak
 
## Kenzo

Step Behind the Veil  
For 10 minutes activate ability to fade partially into the spirit realm. Pass through walls, hover, etc.  
Once per short rest?  
Possibly also include some kind of bonus senses thing?  
Maybe save this for capstone at level 17 and make stronger?  
Improved Soul Sense  
Can replace one unarmed strike from FoB with soul sense. When you hit target of soul sense with unarmed strike, can spend 1 ki to inflict an extra MA die + Wis force (or psychic) damage, and inflict poisoned condition.  
Alternatively, when you spend ki with soul sense to learn the conditions, poisons, or diseases affected a target of your soul sense, you can cure one disease or condition (list)
