Initial notes on psionics monk for Kong:
 
Base loosely off 4E monk; at each level, get to pick 2 disciplines, which (mostly) let you cast spells in exchange for ki. Generally ki cost should be spell level + 1, but some can be just spell level.
 
Some choices should not require ki spend, or require reduced ki spend (e.g. a utility spell)
 
Get features at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th: roughly correspond to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th/5th level spells
 
3rd level: get 1 cantrip, perhaps from a choice of a few, plus 2 disciplines
