Expertise vs Advantage:
 
Several Dwarven traits and rune bonuses give benefits to situational applications of skills. In general, advantage is better than expertise until very high level, but advantage alone does not affect the possible range, and doesn't stack. Expertise, because it stacks with advantage, can in some cases get extremely strong, especially at high level.
 
My design decision has been to allow Expertise for tools and for occasional memory/knowledge skills that seem like cannot be easily aided by "Help" actions. In other cases, use advantage, which works better with bounded accuracy.
   

Runes:
 
Stoneworker has 3 of 4 elemental control runes - this is intentional as I didn't see an obvious way to connect control of air to crafting. Plus gust seems kind of useless so don't think anyone would be disappointed by this choice.
 
Overall goal is to make dwarves feel less like arcane casters (e.g. by having a cantrip they can use) and more "different." In addition, build a framework that allows addition of higher level rune casting with feats, etc, which expand the power of known runes.
 
However, need to balance with simplicity too -- easy to overdesign and then have something that is too complicated in practice.
 
Also, need to maintain balance among 7 different subraces which is not trivial. Since they are castes, should not feel too different and should all feel like Dwarves.
 
Finally, have some design goals:  
-maintain the mountain dwarf +2/+2 quirk  
-make dwarves feel flexible  
-keep amount of homebrew reasonable so it doesn't get out of control to manage
 
I think the major/minor rune distinction is a little complicated, it mostly arises from the constraint of mountain dwarf +2/+2, which means that mountain (Warrior) dwarves need to have a 'weak' rune option.
 
The alternative would be to have the rune itself give a +1 to STR….might try that out and see what I think of the flavor.
 
Alternative - give a choice of a handful of minor runes in the base class, and then each caste gets either a) a major rune or b) another ability worth approx +1 ASI
 
Rethinking again:  
-the key feature of runes should be that they are **items** -- this means a few things:

1. You have to inscribe them on something; I don't like the flavor of the Kobold press stuff that has you sketching runes in the air; dwarves are first and foremost crafters. The Rune Knight flavor feels great but of course it a) overpowered for a racial feature and b) warrior specific
2. The effects should generally involve self, or touch, only, unless you are giving the rune to somebody. No benefit at range. Can be 'radius centered on self'.
3. Should be tied to specific items.

-for practical purposes, they need to be more limited than currently. Realistic to design maybe ~10 major and ~6 minor *at most*.  
--think of **one** rune that should be the key feature of a particular caste and is caste specific (since travelers and warriors don't get major runes this would be 5), and then have another 4-6 that are
 
More powerful rune casters:
 
A few ideas:  
--Prestige class UA has a rune scribe class. This would be feasible to slightly modify/extend to be a prestige class for dwarves only.  
--some classes could have a rune variant subclass, taking inspiration from the rune knight fighter subclass  
--racial feats could give access to additional runes, and potentially more powerful runes, modeled after something like magic initiate and/or the Kobold Press Deep Magic Runes book.
   

Thinking again:  
--there should be rune warriors (fighter subclass, paladin oath?), runecasters (cleric domain?), maybe artificiers -- these would all be dwarf-specific classes
 
## Dwarf Design Notes v2
 
Okay, some new stuff. Coming to like runes as presented in the GM Binder doc and this is pretty similar to many runic variants out there (master runes with a variety of effects).
 
Ideas for classes:  
-rune knight -- warrior subclass based on UA  
-rune-caster - reflavored warlock variant  
-rune-scribe - wizard school or prestige class
 
Probably don't really need more than that ever…
 
Feats:  
May need some tuning re: balance around ASI +1 or not, allowing swaps, etc but basic idea is there. One option to get you more runes, one to unlock more power
