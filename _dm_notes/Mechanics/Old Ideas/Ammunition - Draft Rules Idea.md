## Tracking Ammunition
 
Ammunition comes in two types: breakable (arrows, sling bullets, darts, crossbow bolts, and any other light, small, easy to lose/break thing that you usually carry in a notable quantity), and durable (javelins, daggers, hand axes, and most other weapons with the thrown property).
 
When you used a ranged attack:

- Mark a durable weapon as used. During combat, if you have thrown your last weapon you cannot throw another unless you try to recover it during the battle.
- Mark a breakable ammo as used only if you miss or score a critical hit, or if the DM indicates that your arrow is destroyed in a successful attack. If you miss (or critical hit, etc) with your last arrow, you are out of ammo, but as long as you don't need to mark it off you are always assumed to have one more arrow to shoot.
 
After the battle:

- Unless special circumstances dictate otherwise, you automatically recover all durable ammo used in combat.
- Do not do anything for breakable ammo; anything lost during battle is assumed to be permanently gone.
 
_Rationale: Ranged combat needs the counterbalance of ammo costs, but having to keep track is a pain, and convoluted rules to recover ammo are annoying to deal with. Tracking ammo when you use it is as simple as possible. Thrown weapons are expensive (relatively) and big, so just let them get recovered easily, but need to track during combat as you typically only have a limited number of them. Arrows etc are disposable, and you carry a lot, so just assume you don't run out during combat unless you have a string of bad luck, but you do need to spend gold maintaining you supply._
