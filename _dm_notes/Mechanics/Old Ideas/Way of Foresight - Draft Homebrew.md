Monks of the Way of Foresight use their ki to attune themselves to the world of prophecy and dreams, allowing them glimpses of futures, both likely and unlikely. These monks learn to sense what is coming, and reaction to the probabilities of the future, not just the observations of the present.
 
As a monk of the Way of Foresight, you gain the following benefits.
 
**3rd level**
 
_Precognition_. You gain the ability to perceive the flow of time, and see glimpses of the future. This gives you the following options:

- You have advantage on initiative rolls.
- You can cast _Augury_ for 2 ki.
- You can use an action to enter a precognitive trance, requiring 2 ki. This trance lasts for 1 minute. While you are in this trance, whenever you make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you roll a d4 and add it to the total.
 
**6th level**
 
_Improved Precognitive Trance._ Your precognitive trance allows you to see enemies' weaknesses and guess their actions. While you are in your trance, you can spend 1 ki and use your reaction in response to an attack hitting you to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, possibly causing it to miss.
 
In addition, when you hit an enemy with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki to strike a weak point and do additional force damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die. You can only use this ability once per turn.
 
**11th level**
 
_Foreknowledge._ You may mediate for 1 minute and expend 5 ki to cast _divination._
 
_Altered Time._ You can see what will happen with enough precision to anticipate it, allowing you to act quicker than normal. You can spend 4 ki to cast _haste_.
 
**17th level**
 
_Foresight._ You can see glimpses of the future, allowing you to sense what may happen. This ability gives you the following benefits:

- You cannot be surprised
- While you are in your precognitive trance, rolls against you cannot have advantage, and you cannot roll with disadvantage.
- When you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that fails, you can choose to reroll it. You must use the new roll. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
 
_Dreamsight._ You can spend 6 ki to cast the _dream_ spell.
