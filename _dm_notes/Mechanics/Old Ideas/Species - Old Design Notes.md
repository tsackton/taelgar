Elves: they are the least changed in many ways from standard 5E, and feel kind of unsatisfying, but it is not really clear at all to me how to make them different / better. Elves should feel innately magical, and somehow just getting a cantrip or a bonus spell at 5th level doesn't feel enough, but really giving them power would be unbalanced and impossible. So a little stuck.
 
Dwarves: quite happy with both the lore and the crunch on these, but currently a lot more complicated in many ways than other races.
 
Stoneborn: Still doesn't feel quite right, but is close. Feels like there needs to be some kind of mechanical system to tie things together, something like the way Psionics in UA uses a Psionics die. A 'discipline die' could work well, but a little hard to balance perhaps. The general mechanic of having an extra die to use for something is very common, though, although a bit tacked on for races.
 
Lizardfolk: Honestly feel pretty good, although perhaps that is partly lack of imagination. Lizardfolk abilities seem more fluff than crunch, so to speak, and it isn't really clear they need or could use a distinct mechanic.
 
Halflings: probably fine, these are supposed to be more human-like and telepathy/racial memory is pretty much their thing. Clearly could tie into Psionics in some ways, eventually.
 
Honestly, probably not worth tinkering too much more at this point, depending on whether people play these or not. Elves perhaps need the most work as they feel the least 'Taelgar' -- halflings, lizardfolk, and dwarves have distinct magical abilities for sure. Stoneborn feel a little flat still but closest to a new idea there.￼  
**Additional design notes / ideas:**  
-may want to split "race" and "culture" to separate inborn attributes from cultural/upbringing attributes
