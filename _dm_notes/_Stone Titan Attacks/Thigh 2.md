Scene:
 
This was a grell lair, carefully fed by the mind flayers to keep happy. A pair of grells plus a few intellect devourer pets hung out in a large cavern.
 
Layout used to be a large pool of water fed by a stream from above, in a cavern. This was an undercavern / crypt below the temple, with a simple trap added by the mind flayers when the took over, basically a dam that would break and flood the water out.
 
The trap has been set off by previous party, but the flood has slowed and the pool is mostly empty.
 
Challenges:

1. Getting up to the opening - unless they are flying, will require Athletics check, DC 17 (this is not easy with the movement of the leg). Failure = falling, unless have ropes tied etc, which would give another check for someone to hold on. Still take damage as the leg swings and thuds against you.
2. The opening is a gash in the side of the body, under the pool, so totally filled with water. The exit is partially filled with rubble keeping the flow slow and the short tunnel water-filled. Easiest thing to do would be clear the rubble and just let the water flow out. Otherwise can squeeze into the tunnel, but will need to hold breath for 3-5 minutes to get out.
3. Once they get inside, clear scene of a large magical blast. There is a deep pool that is 3/4ths empty, water slowly draining out the bottom. The remaining water is chalky and silted, with bits of quaggoth floating in it (Perception check to notice). The rest of the area is a large (40-50') cavern with a high ceiling, gently sloping up from the pool to an incongruously placed set of stairs leading up (cavern looks natural, stairs clearly not). The floor in places has been turned to rubble, making it difficult terrain, except for one smooth circular pit in the floor of the cavern leading down, next to the shore of the pool. [this is how the previous party got in, magically carving a tunnel up the leg - one of them died in the trap but fell down the tunnel). Falling down the tunnel will be bad, it is about 100' down to a pile of rubble filling the bottom of the leg.
4. Two grell live here, eating whatever is tossed down for them. Since the incursions, a small group of grimlocks has also been sent to watch - one will try to sneak away immediately. The grells wait for the grimlocks to attack and then attempt to ambush someone and pull them away to eat. If a grimlock is killed and the party seems hard to fight, they may optionally try to sneak off with a grimlock for food instead.
5. This is the trash pit of the operation. Searching the pool (with disadvantage unless they let it drain) will reveal the bodies of some quaggoths and grimlocks, some consumed down to bones, others intact, of various ages. The oldest are consumed, the most recent seem to have been killed in battle. There are also spent arrows around, and shattered glass that could have been a spent potion bottle.
