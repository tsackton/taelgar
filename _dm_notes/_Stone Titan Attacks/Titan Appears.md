_A few miles ahead, a giant form comes into view. Too big to even be called a giant, it looks more like a mountain on two feet. Towering thousands of feet above the earth, a giant stone humanoid strides towards you, slowly but inexorably. Every minute or so, a leg the size of a tower lifts up, swings forward, and lands with a thud, arms swinging. What passes for a face, marked only by a single large red eye, stares unblinking towards the east and the direction of Dunmore._
 
_Pouring out of one side is a waterfall of dirty-looking water, too far off to make out much details. The left foot has a gaping crack in it, revealing a cave inside. The entire top of the right foot seems to have been blown off by some magical energy, exposing what seems to be a collapsed pile of rubble. With each step more rocks and earth tumbles to the ground from the foot._
 
_The creature, if that's what it is, seems far too distant and focused on its objective to notice you on the ground below it as it continues to move slowly but surely towards town._

Perception / investigation / other relevant skill checks can reveal the following:
 
1. The cave in the left foot would be easy to climb, you can see a straightforward way into the exposed cavity, but it is not obvious where it leads
2. Climbing the legs themselves would be difficult given the movement, but lots of rough surfaces
3. The exploded right foot does not look natural, probably caused by the destruction force of a spell combined with the movement of the creature. A high roll can reveal evidence that someone entered the creature that way.
4. The water is dirty, almost chalky. It seems to be coming from inside the torso of the creature. It is not a rapid stream, but is more than a trickle
5. The creature in total is at least 1000 feet tall, and at least the size of a small castle across
6. The whole thing is obviously magical
 
Maybe more stuff? Obviously will have to nudge them in the right direction if they donâ€™t think / decide to go inside. Generally goal should be to get them to pick a route.
