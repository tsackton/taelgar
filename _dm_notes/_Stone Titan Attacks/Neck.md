Scene notes:
 
This is a skill challenge, basically. The neck is a long vertical tunnel, ascending in total darkness, with stairs like the ones in the LOTR movies into Mordor -- steep, narrow, and dark. The stair is older, its origin mysterious, but it should feel like the ascent into Mordor.
 
The opening from below should be easy to find -- there is a rope hanging down from it from previous party -- but climbing without any special preparation requires a DC 15 Dex check (adding proficiency if proficient in either acrobatics or athletics). Failure means you slip, falling unless you make a DC 12 Dex save (in which case hanging on by hands). Fall damage could be significant as it is 40 feet up neck, plus 10 feet from entrance to ceiling of temple.
 
Simple precautions (ropes, etc) make this easier - could give advantage on check.
 
The mind flayers of course just levitate up, and the quaggoth can climb.
 
This is also the place where the influence of chalyte is the strongest. Should feel eerie and weird and creepy. A queasiness permeates the place. Feel unsettled.
