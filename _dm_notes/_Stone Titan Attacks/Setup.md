_The town of [[Dunmore]] is bleak these days: no food to go around, sickness and disease spreading, and uncertain morale as rumors of the sky falling, people losing their minds, and stones sprouting from the ground to crush armies run rampant through the city. For reasons that seem unclear now, you ended up here, and find yourself walking into the guardhouse above the main gates of the town to speak to Captain Finy, a small, thin man with sparse graying hair and a limp. The captain points to the few other humanoids in the room and says "These will be your companions, you may as well introduce yourselves."_
 
_\<AFTER INTRODUCTIONS\>_
 
_The captain continues in a shaky voice. "So, you may have heard the one about stones sprouting from the ground to crush our armies? I am terrified to say it seems true. Reports are that some kind of massive stone construction has been moving from wastes around the destroyed Ulrich Monastery in our direction. A whole battalion was crushed beneath it, two small teams of adventurers have set forth and not reported back, and we are out of options. It must be stopped." With a glance around the room, he continues under his breath, "Good thing we saved the best for last."_
 
_"Well, then. Whatever resources I can provide are yours, but you best set out due west as soon as possible. Our last report is that the construct, whatever is it, was five days from town and moving fast. Any questions?"_
 
_\<After questions: any mundane equipment you can have, also 2 potions each, 1 regular healing, 1 any uncommon potion of your choice. Could also provide 1st level spell scrolls, up to 1 per character.\>_

**Setup:** Players need a reason to be in [[Dunmore]], a substantial fortified town on the western frontier of Sembara, historically a center for trade but repurposed as defensive fortifications during the blood years.

**Developments:** Improvise any within town roleplaying they want to do, any research, etc, just go with flow. Grab names from [https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=me](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=me) as needed.
