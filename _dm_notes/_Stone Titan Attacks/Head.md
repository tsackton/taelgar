Scene notes:
 
_You reach the top of the narrow, rough hewn stairs which open into a large circular room, maybe 100 feet across. In the middle of the room, you see a horrible creature -- humanoid, dressed in dark, blood-stained robes, but with four tentacles where a mouth should be, staring at a large deep hued purple crystal hovering the center of the room. Blood is dripping from a gaping wound in its side as it looks up, the crystal humming, and you hear a whisper in your mind, "More food for me. Come, friends, let us eat together."_
 
_All around the creature are signs of a battle. Four similar such creatures lay dead on the ground, along with a tall human in shining plate armor, sword broken underneath him, and a lanky halfling, head cracked open and her brain spilling out on the ground. An intense, throbbing hum permeates the space. Other than the dull glow from the crystal, there is no light in here._
 
The mind flayer in the middle is wounded (36 hp) and will use its action each turn to control the titan. This requires concentration, if he is wounded needs to make save, if fails titan will begin to fall.
 
Three quaggoths are hiding in the shadows above, using climbing ability. A final mind flayer (full health) is levitating 50' above on the ceiling. [Can add more quaggoths if seems too easy, subtract if they are badly wounded.]
 
The plate armor is magical plate mail +2 that provides resistance to elemental damage (fire, cold, lightning, thunder, acid). The dead human also has one superior healing potion that he never got to use, and a longsword of disruption (same as mace of disruption).
 
The dead halfling carries a wand of fireballs (currently 1 charge), a wand of the war mage +1, an Ioun Stone of Greater Absorption (can cancel up to 17 more levels of spells), and a chime of opening (5 charges left).
 
The mind flayers themselves do not have any treasure per say.
 
The purple gem is a large chunk of pure chalyte which could fetch a tidy price, although generally in Sembara chalyte is not well known.
