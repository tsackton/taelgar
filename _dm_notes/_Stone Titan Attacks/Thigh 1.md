Scene:
 
Squeeze up out of 'leg tunnel' in to a small cavern, maybe 30' in diameter. Tunnel comes out on side wall, about 15' up. Every time the leg moves, the opening constricts -- if you get caught going through the opening during a step requires a DC 15 Dex save, on success jump into cavern taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage, on failure get cut in half and crushed to death. Timing the jump requires only a DC 10 Intelligence or Dex (your choice) check. If you succeed on the timing, can make a DC 17 acrobatics check to avoid damage from fall.
 
In the cavern, a layer of noxious gas covers the floor, about 10' above ground. When land in the cavern, make a DC 15 Con save. On success, no effect. On failure, cough and choke on the gas. Take 2d6 poison damage, and are considered poisoned while in the room. After leaving the room, poison lasts for 1 hour. The gas is also flammable - as soon as someone with a torch jumps down, it will explode. Everyone in the gas must make a DC 20 Dex save or take 3d6 fire damage. But the poison effect is now gone.
 
The gas is faintly colored - careful investigation from the top can reveal that the air below seems discolored and you catch a faint smell of sulfur. If using darkvision, roll with disadvantage on perception check.
 
In the ceiling directly above, there is a jagged hole, with bits of dust and rubble falling with every step.
