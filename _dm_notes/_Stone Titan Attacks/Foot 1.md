Scene:
 
Getting "into" the foot is itself a challenge. The cave opening is obvious, but every 60-90 seconds or so the foot lifts up, moves forward, and plants itself on the ground. Each step carries it maybe 50 feet, so it is moving relatively fast.
 
A reasonable plan - hanging on while it swings - should be fine but require rolls for anything outlandish.
 
The cave in the foot is a small cavern, maybe 20' across, and damp. Every step shakes mud and earth down from the ceiling.
 
Careful investigation will reveal a crack in the ceiling (no roll). Water is dripping from it and stuff shaking from above. The area is intensely cold.
 
On the ceiling is a patch of brown mold (DMG p. 105). The temperature in the cave is noticeably cold, and anyone trying to climb into the crack will take cold damage as described.
