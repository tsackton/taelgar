Notes:
 
Linear until meeting the titan:  
Setup is all just RP  
Journey is all description  
Meeting the titan should involve some skill checks to learn stuff
 
Entering the titan:  
Foot #1 entrance is a cave, easy enough but more in titan journey  
Thigh #2 entrance is what looks like a gaping wound pouring liquid, much harder to enter but less travel in titan (caused by first party to go in, high level group that is all dead)  
Foot #2 is the way that the second party (round 2 characters) entered, was a narrow cave that is partially collapsed -- hardest to find but easier path up as much of foot #2 and leg #2 is cleared out
 
In titan:
 
Foot #1 trap  
Leg #1 easy ish battle  
Thigh #1 ?? Probably not battle but need idea
 
Thigh #2 easy battle plus hard, partially disarmed trap - could be grell here, with some quaggoth
 
Main body -- former Dwarven temple, has several parts including: at least one hard battle, two easy/medium battles, one hard trap / puzzle to get to neck, and some signs of previous parties; this should be deadly area, also most battles
 
Neck - skill / puzzle
 
Head - final battle with mind flayers, here is where first party died, leaving large fraction of enemies dead but titan not shut down and a few enemies left to kill
 
Finale / denouement -- one version for success, one for failure
 
**UPDATE CURRENT DAY (YEAR 200) HISTORY FOR OUTCOME**
 
-success: ruined titan a landmark in the western wastes; people talk about battle as a turning point of Blood Years for Sembara  
-failure: Titan was eventually stopped but not before a few cities were destroyed / conqueored / enslaved by mind flayers; destroy a couple of cities on western wastes, modify path of wall, have major issue on the west be continuing raids and mind control, plagues, etc from the lost cities.
