**SUCCESS:**
 
If they kill mind flayer concentrating on chalyte gem, eerie silence will fall and a cessation of movement. But now balanced precariously, and they will need to get out very fast before titan topples. Flying or similar would be obvious success. If they can get outside can perhaps try to 'ride' the titan down, which would require a good Acrobatics check.
 
If they just do nothing, 10d6 bludgeoning damage if inside stone, 20d6 if free falling outside.
 
If anyone survives, give a brief narration of Dunmore, and then let everyone give a "where are they now."
 
**FAILURE:**
 
If they all die, obviously, they are dead. The titan continues into Dunmore, wrecking the city, although it is eventually brought down, the devastation ushers in a long period of mind flayer domination on the western frontier.
