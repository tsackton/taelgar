Scene:
 
A long, muddy crawl with a opening at the "knee" where two black puddings lurk.
 
If they get into the ceiling of the foot, there is a narrow, damp tunnel curving upwards that is barely wide enough for one person to crawl. You need to climb up, bracing against the walls. Tiring and slow, and each time the leg moves you need to brace yourself for impact.
 
Half way up come out into a larger chamber (natural cavern), maybe 40' in diameter. A large damp, oily slick on the floor shakes with each step.
 
One beefed up (extra HP) black pudding hangs here, with two gray oozes. Will drop on first character up, potentially surprising them. Rest of party will need to climb out one at a time to join battle.
 
After the "knee" cave, tunnel widens, meaning can't squeeze up anymore, have to actually climb. This is difficult with thudding movement. But it is a short climb, only 20 feet to large opening to new cavern.
