Vril'ghaal, Harbinger of the Shadowed Tides

Defeated the aboleth, revealing that the aboleth was working for a secret group called the Umbral Conclave. He was raising an army for some purpose.

Next session will be back in Voltara, downtime/research, level ups. Learn that the Umbral Conclave was a group behind the the War of the Dark Rift, to the south. Can possibly find some clues:
- The Umbral Conclave was associated with a extraplanar incursion from the Shadowfell, that sparked the War of the Dark Rift
- They were defeated by Chardonian armies, after the Shadow Armanda was destroyed
- The Umbral Conclave were said to be commanded by a creature known as Vril'ghaal, the Harbinger of the Shadowed Tides
- They were assumed to all be killed, although know one knows for sure
- The armies of the Umbral Conclave were largely made of what seemed like shadow dwarves, twisted creatures of shadow and somehow corrupted
- The dwarven kingdom below Enderra (needs a name), on the Apporian Peninsula, was completed destroyed.
- A series of border forts were constructed by Chardon, but these are largely abandoned now, and the peninsula has been quiet for many years
- That said, few dare venture into the mountainous interior of the Apporian Peninsula, once the heartland of the Umbral Conclave; if there are any clues to be found, that is where
- Start at the port town of Castrella, and head the Kedron river; there is still a manned fort near the headwaters, and they can give you more information if you wish to venture into the wastes. 

Basic adventure will be:
1-2 sessions downtime/travel; Castrella, and then up the river to a maintained border fort
Learn that the Umbral Conclave constructed a series of monuments, or tombs, or something, dedicated to Vril'ghaal (adapt somehow to mummy adventure, tweak a bit to make it like a Aztec jungle temple in a strange valley, and twist the mummy to create a bit of spooky aberration energy)
Run mummy adventure
