## Background

### Yeshara and Cairn Dor

- Thousands of years ago, before the [[Downfall Wars]], the Yo'nari, a tribe of proto-Deno'qai, lived in the interior mountains of Apporia. (**Yo’nari** /yo-NAH-ree/)
- They often interacted with the fey in those days, and they called the Feywild **Nazil-Dimu** /nah-ZEEL DEE-moo/
- They had a queen, Yeshara (**Yeshara** /yeh-SHAH-rah/), who came to believe that the fey lived in dreams, and sleep was made you vulnerable. She more or less went mad after her brother, **[[Ilanar]]** (/ee-lah-NAHR/), vanished after striking a bargain with a silver-tongued fey trickster; Yeshara later found [[Ilanar]] in a catatonic dream-torpor. This “proof” cemented her crusade.
- Before the cult formed, Yeshara barred the longhouse doors each night, forcing her household—spouse, young daughter, elderly aunt—to chant wake-mantras until dawn. After eleven nights the child slipped into microsleep; Sarzel, panicked, doused her with scalding cauldron-water. The girl died, and Sarzel proclaimed it proof that even love could not sway the fey’s grip.
- After this tragedy, some of the tribe fled, but the rest fell under Yeshara's sway, as the tribe descended into a cult. Yeshara:
	- Outlawed sleep rites and lullabies.  
	- Imposed vigil-fasts: waxing-moon weeks with no rest. 
	- Punished “dream-taint” with public banishment to night-bogs. 
- Culminated in the Mid-winter Rite, when Yeshara tried to sever the connection between the people of her tribe and the Plane of Consciousness, assuming this would stop them from sleeping and dreaming and thus save them.
	- To enact the Mid Winter Rite, Yeshara constructed the [[Cleaver-Stone]], an enormous bronze-and-obsidian trilith topped by a wolf-carved lintel.
- In this evil act, the domain of Cairn Dor was created, and Yeshara and her people transported. The Cleaver-Stone became a portal between realms. 

### The Shadow Wars

- Yeshara was pleased to find herself in a realm with no dreams, and only the strangest and briefest of sleep. She dedicated herself to freeing the rest of the people of the material plane. 
- The shadow wars occur in cycles, and always begin the same way, with a period of minor incursions during which time Yeshara builds her armies. Basic idea here is that there are two "peoples" in Cairn Dor: the citizens, those who have been freed from dreams, and the soldiers, those who fight. Nurim-Dor /NOO-rim DOR/ “People of Eternal Waking”, and the Shemra-Azem /SHEM-rah ah-ZEM/, "Guardians of the Vigil". The Shemra-Azem are kept awake by the eternal sleep of "dreamers". So the first stage of all wars involve raids to steal "dreamers" to wake the Shemra-Azem. When the Shemra-Azem are killed in battle, the dreamers in Cairn Dor die, and at that point the Shemra-Azem fades. 
	- This sets up three things: first, currently in the "stealing dreamers" phase, which means that lizardfolk are rescuable by entering Cairn Dor and awaking them. Second, the long lead time required to steal dreamers means wars have a slow ramp up. Finally, although the metaphysics are not totally worked out, let's assume that the more similar the "dreamers" are the more efficient, so this tends to result in each war starting with disappearance of a bunch of villages of the same species. 
- The shadow wars usually end when her armies are expended. The terrain of the interior mountains is challenging and armies can't easily march in, plus the shadow armies seem to vanish as fast as they appear.
- Three important shadow wars were:
	- A war early during the Great Peace, when Drankorian armies marched all the way to the Cleaver-Stone, and build a fortress around it to stop further incursions. The Cleaver-Stone cannot be destroyed unless the Cairn Dor is itself destroyed. But the arrangement of stones around the Cleaver-Stone forms a soul compass, which can be used to target raids for more "dreamers". So a fortification around the Cleaver-Stone dramatically slows down wars, because of difficulty of gathering dreamers without access to the soul compass. 
		- Because of this, until the fall of Drankor, no more shadow wars happened
	- A war in the 1100s / early 1200s, in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, when Castrella is just beginning to emerge as a major power, and the fort had been abandoned. This is when the "hero of the crystal" fights (connection to Blue's backstory). Possibly a small party reaches the fort / Cleaver-Stone, but never returns? The soul compass is damaged during this war, and the Cleaver-Stone portal locked again, but the fort is not restored. This is the war where the name, the Umbral Covenant, is invented for the enemies - but the Umbral Covenant is not what the shadow armies call themselves, they are the Shemra-Azem, the "Guardians of the Eternal Waking". 
		- For a time, neither Yeshara nor anyone else occupies the fort. The details don't really matter here but perhaps somehow it is lost, Yeshara is temporarily bound, something. 
	- The [[War of the Dark Rift]], about 150 years ago, involved the destruction of a dwarven kingdom near the Cleaver-Stone, and ended with a major defeat of the shadow forces but did not involve any investigation of the interior. 
		- The [[War of the Dark Rift]] erupted not from the Cleaver-Stone -- which was still lost to Yeshara -- but somehow (details TBD) from a separate rift. 
		- While Yeshara and the Shemra-Azem were defeated and suffered a major setback in terms of number of warriors, as a consequence of the [[War of the Dark Rift]] they were able to recapture the fort and rediscover the Cleaver-Stone
	- Now, another shadow war is starting during the long, slow build up (lizardfolk village incursions).
		- With access to the Cleaver-Stone and the soul compass, Yeshara can be sneaky and infiltrate almost anywhere. Lizardfolk, due to their connection to the Dreamworld, are particularly strong as "dreamers", and so Yeshara has focused on stealing lizardfolk, taking whole villages to leave a mystery. But people in Apporia have also been affected. 

### The Adventure

So this sets up the following:
- Taking the fort and destroying the soul compass means that Yeshara will struggle to continue raiding lizardfolk villages, however it does not free anyone trapped in Cairn Dor, so leaves open the next quest. 
- The fort is guarded by a lieutenant of Yeshara, and should have abundant clues that explain:
	- The history of Yeshara and Cairn Dor
	- The role of the soul compass in lizardfolk village raids
	- The role of the Cleaver-Stone and the "hero in the crystal" portal locks that are now destroyed
	- The fate of the lizardfolk villages - they were stolen into Cairn Dor

## Starting Information

The first part of the adventure is getting to the fort. Information should point the way to Apporia, and then in Apporia should have rumors to track down the fort. 

### Blue's Backstory Connection

The story of Blue's crystal starts during the War of Severed Dreams (the war before the [[War of the Dark Rift]]). 

During this war, the human forces fight mostly to a stalemate, but a small group of adventurers fights their way to the fort. They manage to damage the soul compass and reactivate the Drankorian portal locks, but are killed. 

One of these adventurers is Atanza, a plane-touched woman from Castrella, whose soul is somehow connected to the Plane of Creation (effectively an aasimar). When she is killed, through the magic of her plane-touched connection, a fragment of her soul crystalized and crashes as a meteor (cf other hints that meteors are connected to plane of creation / divine realms / etc). 

Over the course of the next 500ish years, the meteor is found and the crystal at its heart extracted. It slowly makes its way east, being traded and sold, its connection to the Atanza and the umbral wars forgotten if they were ever know, until it ends up in Isingue before the Great War.

When the mad scientist hobgoblins invade the plaguelands, they discover the crystal. For a while it is kind of inert, but triggers something in Blue, basically a resonance of the plane touched essence. This is a slow process, and takes some experimenting to get things going, etc. Hobgoblins keeps trying to use Blue to "turn" others. 

Eventually, Blue and the crystal bond, and Blue has a wild magic surge that results in random teleportation. See below. 

>When she awoke, Blue found herself on a beach, blue sky above, sand in her mouth, the sound of gentle waves in the distance, and the fading echoes of a vivid dream in her mind, all of which she could remember was powerful sense of fear and danger associated with the name the [[Umbral Covenant]]. With no idea even what year it was, much less where she had ended up, Blue wandered, keeping to herself, but always on the lookout for any kind of information or clues about the Umbral Covenant. 
>
>Over the course of the next year, she was run out of more villages than she could count. She learned that she had appeared in a place called the [[Chardonian Empire]], a realm far to the west of her homeland in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], and that it was nearly 100 years after she had been captured, although she did not feel like she had aged at all in captivity. She also grew strong, learning to channel magic through her connection to the crystal in her skull, although she could not always control completely, and when he threw herself into her magic completely, her appearance became even stranger somehow. 
>
>During her wanderings, the one thing she held on to was the [[Umbral Covenant]], and the whispers of anger, danger, and fear from her crystal, warning about them. She learned that the Umbral Covenant had the agressors in a war against the famous city of [[Chardon]], the [[War of the Dark Rift]], and were defeated more than 100 years ago, before she was even captured, despite having captured much of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]]. She learned that the [[Umbral Covenant]] had emerged from deep in the mountains of [[Apporia]], from a kingdom called [[Enderra]], now assumed completed destroyed. She learned that the [[Umbral Covenant]] had corrupted dwarves and turned them into nightmare shadow servants, forcing them to fight. She heard many rumors of how shadows had emerged from the mountains, sweeping down into the coastal cities of [[Apporia]] with armies of ghostly dwarves who bled darkness and who could not be killed by mundane weapons. But every tale she heard told the same fate: the Umbral Covenant launched a Shadow Armanda against Chardon, and were destroyed, utterly and completely. And no tale seemed to explain why the crystal still seemed terrified of a threat that was defeated so long ago. 
>
>A few weeks ago, lingering along the most desolate section of the trade road to Voltara, Blue stumbled across the body of a messenger and his horse, who had apparently fallen in a ravine and died, unnoticed. Uncannily, in his messenger bag was a long letter, addressed to the [[Silver Tempests]] in [[Voltara]], containing research concerning strange sigils and a possible connection to the [[Umbral Covenant]]. Intrigued, Blue decided to deliver the letter herself.

### Information / Notes

- [[Blue's Clues]]
- [[ Letter from Chardon for Samso on the Umbral Covenant]]
## Adventure Outline

Part 1: meeting Blue, interactions in Voltara, travel to Apporia (potentially via Samso teleporting to hometown)

Part 2: [[Apporia]], learning more, travel to fort

Part 3: Into the ruins - meat of the adventure, where they explore the fort and learn its purpose and defeat its guardians

- [ ] dungeon
- [ ] combat
- [ ] end game

## Adventure: Part 1

(this should be < 1 hour)

Starts with an information dump and roleplaying the intro to Blue. 

Only real planning part here is timeline of getting to Apporia. Two basic options:
- Travel to Chardon and then get a ship to Apporia. Takes about a month to reach Chardon, and then a week or less to reach Castrella or elsewhere. 
- Teleport Via Plants to Samso's home village.

Can improvise details of Samso's village. 

## Adventure: Part 2

Some useful notes:
- [[Apporia]]
- [[Peninsula Brainstorming]], [[Peninsula Notes]], [[Peninsula NPC Notes]]

Main goal here is to get them to a city where they can learn information. Just improvise but make everything point them to Castrella, most likely. 
### Secrets and Clues

Basic vibes of secrets and clues fall into a few categories.

(1) A number of rumors, from refugees of mountain villages (and maybe lizardfolk), point to something bad happening in the mountains. Waves of insomnia, sleeping sickness in babies from the river valley. People fleeing. Villages abandoned with no one knowing what happened. More recent disappearances have been scattered across the west coast, but the first were in a cluster, before Yeshara focused in on lizardfolk. But more this is about villages being abandoned because of the weird sleep-related problems in the mountains than anything else. 

(2) A number of rumors, particularly from stoneborn, about the history. Rumors of the [[War of the Dark Rift]], and in particular rumors that the Umbral Covenant was originally hunting for something in the mountains. 

(3) Deep ancestral legends, from bards and singers and people who are attuned to folk legends. These hint at the ancient people, the legends of the wolf-eyed queen, the legends of the sleepless watch and the midnight rite, basically this is all about how Yeshara is a folk witch now, who comes to steal your dreams. 

(4) Rumors about Drankor and the fort. Perhaps things like ancient Drankorian milestone pointing on a road no longer really exists (Cairn Dor Guard Post VII, etc). This can hint at rumors from the cycle of wars. 

The basic idea here is the party needs to come up with a pointer to the source that will lead them to going upriver and finding the fort.

### Encounters

- Option 1: A pair of behir, hunting: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194921-behir (easy/medium)
- Option 2: Three dire worgs https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194969-dire-worg (easy/medium), searching for warriors from Cairn Dor on behalf of the Iron Baron of [[Fate's Ruin]]

### Finding the Fort

The Cleaver-Stone is hidden in a canyon, protected by a shadow-illusion maintained by the Shemra-Azem. Basic layout is a steep-sided canyon, but functionally it is like Paths of the Dead in Lord of the Rings - an entrance complex and then an underground / semi-Shadowfell space where the Cleaver-Stone is. 

## Adventure Part 3: The Fort and the Cleaver-Stone

Fort has basically three areas: 
- at the entrance to the canyon, the Drankorian fort. 
- inside the canyon, the ruins of the Yo'nari village / fort
- the Cleaver-Stone chamber

#### Drankorian Fort

- The history of Yeshara and Cairn Dor
- The role of the soul compass in lizardfolk village raids
- The role of the Cleaver-Stone and the "hero in the crystal" portal locks that are now destroyed
- The fate of the lizardfolk villages - they were stolen into Cairn Dor

Fort entrance is a castle built into the canyon walls.
- walls made of white marble, stand out in the otherwise dim canyon

Set up wall fight to have lots of elevational challenges. These defenders fight to the death. 


Inside are several Drankorian ruins. These include:
- barracks -> clues about Drankor, but also perhaps clues related to Blue's backstory, and a sense of varied occupation, notes from Atanza
- armory -> clues about dark domain and maybe a few other things, kinds of weapons, also 
- library -> history details in a variety of books written in Drankorian and other languages, instructions about the portal locks tied to the standing stones surrounding the Cleaver-Stone
- arena / training ground 

Can find clues in all of them. The training ground is occupied by dirt mournling.

Transition: sealed door

Carved with signs of lidless eyes
- Anyone who passes through door must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw
- On failed save, cannot benefit from a long rest until remove curse or greater restoration

#### Yo'nari Village

The remains of the Yo'nari village are here. Vibes are: wolf motifs, Celtic / Germanic architecture, massive stone pillars

Row of pillars leads to longhouse, also two smaller huts survive (a ritual sauna and Yeshara's house), and ruins of many more. Withered tree as well, once where tanshi sacrifices were placed. 

Oppressive air of silence. Everything feels and sounds faded, dim, as if half in another word, and mists limit visibility. 

Three possible encounters:
- long house - main barracks area
- ritual sauna - two "priests"
- Yeshara's hut - ghost of her daughter (non-combat)

Information here:
- Many details about Yeshara from her hut, and speaking to the ghost. This is also a safe place to short rest if they convince the ghost they are friends. 
- Ritual hut - painted depictions of the midnight rite and many, many warnings against **Nazil-Dimu**  and against sleep

### Cleave-Stone

Big chamber, with the trilith and eight standing stones. 
Boss fight.

---

The double iron doors into this area can be easily opened or closed by a Huge or Gargantuan creature. Smaller creatures can open the doors if they work together and have a combined Strength score of 50 or higher. If four or more Large, Medium, or Small creatures work together but their combined Strength score is lower than 50, they open the door after 1 minute of work, but each creature gains one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

The angled ceiling of this room rises to a height of 60 feet, and the whole room is brightly lit. The Crater of the Core has the following features:

- “Intense heat radiates from an enormous magma crater at the east end of the room.”
- “Four massive support pillars rise to the ceiling. The hollow base of each pillar holds a brazier that billows with black smoke.”
- “Seven fire giants, one wearing an obsidian crown and standing taller than the rest, meditate in the room.”
- **(Secret)** The entry corridor’s ceiling contains a 20-foot-cube stone block suspended by chains.

_**The Core.**_ The great pool of lava at the east of the chamber—the Core—is where Zenith Aastrika first found enlightenment, and, as such, is a sacred site to the Sunlight Legion. A fire giant touching the Core at the start of their turn regains 20 hit points; other creatures who touch the Core for the first time on a turn or end their turn in it take 44 (**8d10**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png)) fire damage.

_**Braziers.**_ A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-detect-magic) spell reveals the braziers’ auras of conjuration magic. When combat begins, smoke magically fills the area within 10 feet of each pillar. Each round on initiative count 20, the smoke’s radius increases by 5 feet. The affected area is [lightly obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#VisionandLight), and creatures are [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) while in that area unless they have resistance or immunity to fire damage. As an action, a creature can douse a brazier within reach with 1 gallon of water, ending the effect on that brazier. If a brazier is affected by a [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic) spell or any effect that deals cold damage, this also ends that brazier’s effect.

_**Inhabitants.**_ [Zenith Aastrika](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4486056-zenith-aastrika) is accompanied by a [fire giant lightbearer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485836-fire-giant-lightbearer) and five [fire giant troopers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485838-fire-giant-trooper). When the giants notice intruders in this sacred place, they attack. Zenith Aastrika fights to the death, and when she falls, the other giants flee.

_**Stone Block Trap.**_ A winch near the Core lowers or raises the stone block when turned. When the trap triggers, the stone block in the ceiling falls. Each creature in the block’s path when it falls must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (**10d10**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png)) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The block can be climbed with a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.
