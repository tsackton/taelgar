**Ill Night.**  
_Greatsword, uncommon._
 
Ill Night is a large greatsword with a black skull hilt, and pale green inlay running up the center of the black. It is a +1 weapon. Once per day, on a hit, a character attuned to this sword can cause the green inlay to glow, injecting poison into their target. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer an additional 2d8 poison damage, and are poisoned until the start of their next turn. On success, they suffer half damage and are not poisoned.

## Secrets and Clues, revised:

- Orcs have always lived on the Erbalta Plains (to the north), which is why even though it would be good farmland few people settle there. About fifteen years ago, they united under one ruler and marched south, but were defeated by the Voltaran Guard.
- During the War Against the Broken Fang, against the united tribes of the north, the poor and indigent on the outskirts of town sometimes turned to banditry to pay the tribute the orcs demanded.
- The ruined watchtower known as the Lonely Torch was a base for the orcs during the War Against the Broken Fang. The site is overgrown with an invasive poisonous tangleweed, which covers most of the hills around the tower.
- A witness claims to have seen a group of bandits carrying sacks of treasure heading towards the Lonely Torch. They were pissing on their boots before they went.
- Dousing one's boots with urine protects against the worst effects of the tangleweed and allows creatures to move through it.
- A cloud of bats has been seen flying over the Lonely Torch. Witnesses have reported seeing the bats descend on a large elk that wandered too close to the tangleweed, swarming it and leaving only a bloodless, wrinkled husk behind.
- There have been more attacks on the road from bandits in the past few weeks, especially going to and from the mines, demanding treasure.
- One survivor of a bandit attack reports they are not very well trained or equipped, and seemed to be desperate for money.
- A beggar in the streets claims he was a shepherd, and that a band of orcs surrounded him, demanding loot, and left when he gave them all his possessions. He is destitute now, but at least alive.
- A mercenary reports that she was stationed at the Deepfathom Crystal mine, and the talk of the guards were that an unusually large orc was sneaking around, but no one believed it because orcs are not intelligent or subtle enough to scout a target before attacking.
