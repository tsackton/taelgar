_As you ascend the stairs to the next floor, you emerge to the sight of a large fountain, bubbling and pulsing with energy. Water is cascading down through a hole in floor of the fountain, creating a torrential whirlpool. Water is splashing across the floor of the entire room, making it a slippery mess. The source of the water seems to one floor above, as you can see a water cascading down from a smaller hole in the ceiling._
 
_The room is infused with a sickly green light, and the water of the fountain looks particularly noxious._
   

The Water Weird
 
As soon as the step into the room, the water weird will spiral out of the fountain and attack. Roll stealth for water weird and anyone whose passive perception is lower than roll is surprised.
 
Steam mephits arrive at end of 2nd round (so miss surprise round and 1st round of combat).
 
Developments
 
Destroying the water weird does not cure the corruption immediately. A search will reveal that the sickly green energy is coming from the water above.
 
There is no treasure in this room.
