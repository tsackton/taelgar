_Ascending the stairs to the top floor of the tower reveals a sickening scene. Rotting vines are growing everyone, mostly obscuring what seems to have originally been a magical laboratory and circle of runes. Decaying plant matter collects in piles, and the whole room pulses with a faint greenish light._
 
_In the center of the room is what seems to be a hole in the world. Water is pouring through it, from some murky depths that you can't quite see._
   

Curing the corruption
 
The vines and decaying plant matter are the source of the corruption, feeding on the energy from the Elemental Plane of Water. They are not sentient and cannot attack. Dealing a total of 30 points of damage will destroy the vines. They are immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as necrotic, acid, poison, psychic. They are resistance to thunder and force damage. They are vulnerable to fire and radiant damage. They have AC 12 and automatically fail Dex and Str saves.

1. Every time they take a total of 10 points of damage, one of the rotting piles of plant matter bursts. All creatures in a 10 ft radius from the plant matter take 1d6 acid damage, and must make a DC 11 Con save or suffer **Sewer Rot.**
2. Any time they are hit with a melee bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, the attacker must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or begin to hallucinate. Roll a d6. On a 1-3, this makes them think the piles of rotting corruption are treasure, desirable. [DC 11 Con save or suffer Sewer Rot]. On a 4-6, they imagine that rotting piles of plant matter are rising and animating, and see their allies as vine blights. After 1 attack roll or 1 saving throw, they are cured. If this happens a bunch let them come up with reasons not to keep attacking their allies.
 
Finding the Treasure
 
Investigating the portal to the Plane of Water reveals that there is a sealskin pouch, sealed with wax, hanging from an iron rod that seems to be stuck in place. This is about 100 feet from the portal entrance.
 
Diving through the portal is easy, but the transition to the Plane of Water is a strong, forceful current. Anyone not anticipating it must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw or have the air forced out of them, giving them CON + 1 rounds to move before drowning.
 
Can move up to speed swimming per round (assuming dash), and 1/2 speed the round they get the treasure (can either click the button to unlatch immoveable rod, or just take the pouch).
 
Improvise this depending on how things are going, if it is getting late this doesn't need to be a challenge.
 
Pouch contains: 1 small emerald, worth 300 gp. One elemental gem (water). Staff of the Python. 62 gp and 380 sp. Plus of course they can take the immoveable rod.
