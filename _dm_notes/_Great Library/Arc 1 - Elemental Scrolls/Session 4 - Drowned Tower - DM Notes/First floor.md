_As you come up to the surface, you see the flooded remains of what was once the ground floor entrance to a wizard's tower before you. The dominate feature in the large circular room is a gaping hole in the ceiling, through which a massive waterfall pours, crashing down in waves into the flooded room. A set of stairs along one wall leads up to the next floor, which seems to be above the water level._
 
If they want to explore, require Strength (Athletics) checks, except for Samso. Narrate rotting wood, putrid water, etc. No treasure.
 
If in total, it seems like they spend more than 10 minutes in the water, have everyone who has been in water for \>10 minutes roll a Con save against a DC 11. On a failure, they acquire **Sewer Rot.**
