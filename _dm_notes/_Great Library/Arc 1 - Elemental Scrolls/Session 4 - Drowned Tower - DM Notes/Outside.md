_You have been able to see the tower on the horizon for the better part of a day, as you slowly approach in [good or bad weather depending on skill challenge]._
 
_As you get closer, the air starts to feel humid and damp, almost as if it is about to rain. Mists shroud the base of the tower, lying low over the land and making it hard to see much. From about a mile away, you can clearly see that the tower is in a depression in the ground, filled with mists and clouds, leaving only the top few floors of the tower visible. Looming in the fog ahead of you are trees and vines and damp, soggy ground. You seem to have stumbled upon a swamp in the middle of the grassland._
 
When they enter the foggy area:
 
_The land is muddy and dank. Everywhere you see mists, and occasionally forms that seem to move in the mists. Although it is hard to see clearly, it seems that the tower is sitting in the center of this swamp, in a large pool of water. All around you dead shrubs and tangles of vines._
 
Depending on what they do, there are three possible encounters in the swamp:
 
1. Blights: **three twig blights, three vine blights**. If they head straight for the tower, these will ambush them near the edge of the pool. If defeated, they have no treasure.
2. Will O' Wisp: if the weather is bad (cloudy, dark; arrive at night -- i.e. if they fail the skill challenge), a **will o' wisp** will try to lure them away into a mire of sinking mud (DC 12 Dex save to avoid, on failure target is restrained; as an action can make a Str (Athletics) check against DC 12 to escape, as long as it moves to dry land on the same turn). This encounter won't happen if they succeed the skill challenge.
3. The dead remains of a previous treasure-hunting party, now a **putrid haunt** and two **zombies**. If they spend time exploring, or take a very long time at the pool, roll d6, this encounter happens on 1-3. If destroyed, they can search the bodies. Make a DC 10 Con save or turn away in horror at the smell. If succeed, can roll DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception). On success, find 2d4 gold coins and 3d6 silver coins on each body. In addition, the putrid haunt has a pair of silver bracelets that function as _Gloves of Swimming and Climbing_ when worn together, and each zombie has a rotting pouch with a _Potion of Water Breathing._
 
When they reach the pool:
 
_A pool of faintly greenish, slimy looking water stands before you. A dark stone tower rises out of the pool. You can see no obvious entrance._
 
Getting inside:
 
The easiest option is to swim. The water of the pool is dark and murky, so searching is not easy, but just narrate search. Assuming they do the smart thing and have Samso go swim ahead this is not a challenge, can just narrate going through the door, swimming up, and seeing the flooded first floor. If they do anything stupid make them make CON checks or suffer exhaustion.
   

**XP:**  
Any combat here is worth 150 xp. Finding a way into the tower without anyone suffering exhaustion is worth 50 xp.
