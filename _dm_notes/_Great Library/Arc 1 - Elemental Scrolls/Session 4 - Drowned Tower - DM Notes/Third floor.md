_This floor appears to be the remains of a library. There are a few standing bookshelves, and several that have toppled over. Pieces of books and scrolls are scattered across the floor, some rotting and in pieces. As in the lower floors, there is a large hole in the floor and water is pouring in a waterfall from the ceiling. The stairs continue up ahead of you to another floor._
 
_Standing across the floor from you, incongruously, is a small tree. Standing maybe 10' tall is a small oak tree, with streaks of black lichen in patches on its body and running up and down its trunk._
 
If they search:
 
Stepping into the room will trigger the tree. It will slowly move (DC 10 Wisdom [Perception] to notice movement), and if they get close will animate and swing towards them, speaking in a raspy voice "Who goes there?"
 
*During conversation sounds like it is in pain. Occasionally mutters under its breath. Depending on roleplaying / decisions may attack. If combat starts, two vine blights show up at beginning of 2nd round of combat.
 
Treasure:  
\< 15: nothing  
15-20: two relatively intact books that could be sold, one "The Song of Darius" and the other "A History of the Last Days of Drankor", both written in Drankorian. Total worth 120 gp to the Library.  
21+: books plus _potion of dragon's breath (acid)_ and a _scroll of absorb elements_
 
Dealing with the tree
 
The tree is suffering from a disease caused by the corrupted waters. The rot has slowly built up from drawing nourishment from the water. Removing the corruption will cure the disease, so the easiest solution is to deal with the corruption. Could also use Lesser Restoration or another effect which cures disease. Alternatively a creative approach to purifying the water could work as well, especially if they use spells/resources.
 
This is optional encounter - not forced to confront tree. Don't get XP for just needlessly attacking tree. Get 75 XP for curing tree.
