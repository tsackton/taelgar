_As you ascend the stairs from the flooded first floor, the roaring noise of the waterfall through the middle of the tower continues. The second floor looks like a tidal wave crashed through. The remains of a bedroom are apparent across the floor, with broken walls, wooden wreckage, and the ever-present waterfall. Pools of greenish, smelly water dot the floor. The stairs leading up to the next floor seem to be dripping with sickly greenish-gray algae._
 
Exploring the room:
 
Searching the room is possible, although again spending more than 10 minutes water requires a Con check (DC 11) to avoid Sewer Rot.
 
If they search, roll Wisdom (Perception).
 
\< 15: find tarnished gold beneath the water (4d6 total, will take 10 min to gather).  
15-20: gold, plus a small chest under the bed containing an additional 62 gp, 288 sp, and a scroll case with a _scroll of lesser restoration_.  
21+: gold, chest, plus wedged in the desk drawer, _Ring of Awareness_ (advantage on initiative rolls while wearing, 1d3 charges, functions as wand of secrets).
 
Climbing the stairs:
 
The befouled water acts as a trap preventing characters from proceeding.
 
If they search the stairs, DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Nature) reveals: a) unnatural plant life, b) very slippery, and c) bad smell seems diseased.
 
Fire can burn off trap; rope gives advantage on saving throw.
 
Any character attempting to ascend the stairs must make a DC 12 Dex saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d6 poison damage as tendrils emerge from the walls to begin to wrap them up.
 
As an action, can use Strength check (DC 12) to break free, or the help someone break free.
 
At start of each turn trapped, take 1d6 poison damage.
 
Attacking tendrils is also possible. AC 10, 15 HP, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing, vulnerable to slashing and fire.
 
**XP:** If they get to top cleverly with no one getting trapped due to good plan, 75XP. If they get to top with no one falling prone, 50 XP. If they survive, 25 XP.
