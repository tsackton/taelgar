Resolve downtime quickly. Ideally would get rumors of orc raids into downtime, and also perhaps rumors of wolf attacks (e.g. from Friend's friend).
 
_Yesterday evening, you received a message from Archivist Lyra that she had sent word to Chardon regarding the scrolls you had discovered so far, and a messenger was expected by midsummer, hopefully bringing clues about the final scroll. But that is still weeks away, and so you've been \<downtime activities\>, and waiting impatiently._
 
_After a slow morning, you have gathered in the common room of the Purple Pig inn to eat lunch. The inn is rather empty for the early afternoon, although Dravia, the barkeep is around, as usual. You've become rather well known in the Purple Pig at least, and a few other patrons shout greetings as they go about their business. The talk of the inn for the past week has been rumors of increased bandit activity, and rumors of orcs, and one of the older men, limping past, jokingly asks you "Big and tough guys you are, have you dealt with those bandits yet?"_
 
_As Dravia brings your lunch, she says with a smile, "Ignore old Ghiaro, he's just teasing you. But that reminds me, I met a caravan master this morning you who may want to talk to. He came from the south and says he has news that will be of interest to hardy folk who might be interested in adventure. I know you've been working for that woman Lyra, but perhaps you have time to talk? I'll introduce you for just 1 silver each. He says he is staying in town for a few weeks to trade before heading south again." (she says with a wink)._
 
If they want to meet, let them have the afternoon free to do whatever, then the next morning have them meet with Quintus Percomia, a caravan master and trader who regularly makes the months-long trip south to Chardon with chalyte and minerals from the mines, returning with grain, wine, and salt. Dravia will arrange for him to meet them in the Purple Pig.
 
_Quintus is a well-dressed, wealthy man with short black hair, and a trimmed bead. He turns his nose up a bit at the accommodations as Dravia brings him to your table, although he seems friendly with the barkeep._
 
Quintus can reveal the following information:

They can decide which way to head - west for wolves, east for centaurs. On the road, will encounter bandits.

Wolf attack from Dwarven Vault happens this afternoon.
 
Ask them directly if they want to investigate the wolves, or talk to Quintus.

## Secrets and Clues, orcs:

- Orcs have always lived on the Erbalta Plains (to the north), which is why even though it would be good farmland few people settle there. About fifteen years ago, they united under one ruler and marched south, but were defeated by the Voltaran Guard.
- During the War Against the Broken Fang, against the united tribes of the north, the poor and indigent on the outskirts of town sometimes turned to banditry to pay the tribute the orcs demanded.
- The ruined watchtower known as the Lonely Torch was a base for the orcs during the War Against the Broken Fang. The site is overgrown with an invasive poisonous tangleweed, which covers most of the hills around the tower.
- A witness claims to have seen a group of bandits carrying sacks of treasure heading towards the Lonely Torch. They were pissing on their boots before they went.
- Dousing one's boots with urine protects against the worst effects of the tangleweed and allows creatures to move through it.
- A cloud of bats has been seen flying over the Lonely Torch. Witnesses have reported seeing the bats descend on a large elk that wandered too close to the tangleweed, swarming it and leaving only a bloodless, wrinkled husk behind.
- There have been more attacks on the road from bandits in the past few weeks, especially going to and from the mines, demanding treasure.
- One survivor of a bandit attack reports they are not very well trained or equipped, and seemed to be desperate for money.
- A beggar in the streets claims he was a shepherd, and that a band of orcs surrounded him, demanding loot, and left when he gave them all his possessions. He is destitute now, but at least alive.
- A mercenary reports that she was stationed at the Deepfathom Crystal mine, and the talk of the guards were that an unusually large orc was sneaking around, but no one believed it because orcs are not intelligent or subtle enough to scout a target before attacking.
