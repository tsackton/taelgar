If feeling like need more combat: add one giant subterranean lizard in the pool, clearly crazed. This would be what destroyed the bridge.

Down this passage are three gray oozes that have crept through the rubble. Make sure there are visible clues to corrosion effects.

In Vault Entryway:  
1 carrion crawler plus 2 giant centipedes scrounging on dead creatures  
(+2 centipedes if Marco here)
    
Evensong Farm developments:

- Feria Evensong fled with her young son when the dire wolves first came through, two days ago. She hid with a neighbor and is just now coming back to bury her husband, who was killed defending the farm. She has a cousin, Luca Evensong, who is burly guy and fairly tough, to help.
    - They were attacked in the four days ago, in the afternoon, by a brutal pack of huge wolves. They killed almost her entire flock of sheep, and she and her young son only barely escaped because of the sacrifice of her husband.
    - She is destitute now, her sheep were her livelihood and they are gone.
    - If they are nice and/or give her some treasure, she can tell them about the expedition led by the Windcastle crew that went searching for lost treasure in the mine maybe a week ago.

Add one chamber here
 
Other developments:

- Bridge has collapsed, upon closer examination was a new construction put up by recent explorers. There is a green ichor dripping off the iron bars below. You can still cross on the iron bars.
- New monster(s) has been drawn in to the singing statue; if they go back right away (~1 day) fairly weak, if the wait later it is more difficult.
- In the vault entryway, they can clear some of the rubble, which will reveal a passage leading to a cavern. Some encounter here, plus some dwarven history.
- In same entryway, a careful search will also reveal the magic items

Add: one chamber beyond

Developments:
 
Brelith and Aelor went within the range of the statue. Although the effect was broken, they will occasionally have dreams with flashes of music and a feeling of bloodlust.
 
Since the statue was not destroyed, it will continue to summon monsters to it, enraging them and sending them back out into the world.
 
Redraw map and sketch out some monster fights for different levels. Also add some depths to it, and a clearer way to collapse statue.

Removed trap in interest of time and danger.

Keep these two names

Lapi Castelloventi = Grenwald Windcastle  
Bancio Castelloventi = Thomas Windcastle
 
**Powder of Resistance**.
 
A set of four small containers, each containing a powder of a different color. Sprinkling a powder on yourself, as an action, causes the following effect:
 
_Ruby red._ Resistance to Fire for 1 hour.  
_Pale green._ Resistance to Poison for 1 hour.  
_Golden amber._ Double your speed for 1 minute.  
_Sapphire blue._ Water Breathing for 1 hour.

**Thunderbrand**_._  
_Warhammer, uncommon._
 
Thunderbrand is a massive warhammer of dwarven origin, engraved with the dwarven runes spelling its name and etched in silver.
 
Thunderbrand is massive and cannot be used one-handed. When attuned, it deals an additional 2 (1d4) thunder damage on a hit. In addition, once per day you can use an action to slam the hammer on the ground, making a loud thunderous echo that can be heard 300 feet away. This causes a wave of thunderous force to sweep out from you. Each creature in a 15 foot cube centered on you must make a DC 13 Constitution save. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you.
 
**Coldguard**  
_Shield, uncommon._
 
Coldguard is a solid steel shield etched with the clan markings of the Deepriver clan surrounded by a stylized snowflake design.
 
Coldguard is a magical shield that can absorb cold energy. While attuned, the bearer is resistance to cold damage.

Goldpeak Mountain is the local name for one of the sourthernmost peaks in the Fiamatara_._
 
From the Flamekeeper Scroll quest, they know the area was settled and mined by dwarves hundreds of years ago.
