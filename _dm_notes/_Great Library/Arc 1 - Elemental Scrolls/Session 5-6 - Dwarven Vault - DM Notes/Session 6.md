_After several quiet weeks in Voltara, waiting for news from Archivist Lyra, the calm was broken by an unnatural wolf attack on town. After defeating the wolves, Brelith spent some time in the library and learned of a Dwarven mine at Goldpeak Mountain, founded by the Deepriver clan. Scrolls in the library talked about how the dwarves carved secret chambers into the mines, where powerful magic was hidden. While only a few stray notes hinted at a possible connection to beast attacks, you decided to explore._
 
_The next morning, you had a brief and rather unsuccessful meeting with Quintus Percomia, a caravan master and trader. He did reveal that a tribe of centaurs to the south is seeking help with a befouled lake, but you decided to explore the Dwarven vault, heading on the day and a half journey into the hills._
 
_Once there, you quickly discovered a trail apparently used by wolves and other beasts coming to and fro from the vault. Dispatching three death dogs, three ankhegs, and chuul, albeit coming within an inch of death, you found a eerie obsidian statue of a weeping woman, clearly not dwarven, set in a pool of dark liquid and singing._
 
_After the tough fight in the entry way to the chamber with the statue, you fled, barely alive and still haunted by the eerie song echoing in your head. Hurrying down the trail, you come to a seemingly empty farmhouse a few hours past noon. Weak and injured, you hide out in the barn, resting for the afternoon and evening, and healing._
 
_It is now the next morning. What do you want to do?_
   

- _Give them a few minutes, but introduce Feria and her cousin Luca before they leave the farm, whether they are going back to Voltara or not._

Time since last session start:  
Day 1 - wolf attack, research, inn  
Day 2 - meet Quintus, travel to end of road  
Day 3 - up road, fight, retreat to farmhouse  
Day 4 - session 6  
Day 5 - travel back to Voltara  
Day 6 - session 7 begins in morning

Aglath and Adrik are still poisoned. Need to make a Con save; on fail max hit points reduced by 1d10, on success cured. Alternatively lesser restoration would fix it.
 
Brelith and Aelor will have nightmares where they hear the music, and smell blood, and feel the urge to bite and rend flesh, waking up thinking they were wolves and realizing they are not. This will keep happening as long as the statue is not destroyed, and will happen to anyone who fails a saving throw against the confusion effect.

Oops skipped this.
 
**Developments:**
 
Destroyed statue, and are now back in town. Have them hear rumors of Feria and cousin Luca, plus maybe one or two other farmers who suffered from monster attacks. Work on this. Basically statue is now destroyed.
 
Eventually will need to develop the Dwarven mine complex in more detail
