Crumbling roof area. Tricky to walk along but can find remnants of workshop, with treasure.
 
_As you ascend the staircase, you can feel the stone shifting under your feet. Nothing up here feels very stable._
 
_At the top, there is a hallway leading west and one leading north, each with open arches looking down on the courtyard below. To the west, the hallway ends in a large hole, above the common room. To the north, the floor seems more stable and there is a small room off the hallway. Just past the entryway to the room, the floor disappears into a giant hole leading to the hallway below._
 
Traveling up here is dangerous. Moving anywhere requires a DC 10 Dexterity check; on failure fall 10 feet to corridor below, taking 1d6 falling damage and landing prone; damage can be reduced by 1/2 on a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
 
Getting beyond the large hole into the ruined portion of the work space above the kitchen is even more challenging, requiring a DC 15 Dexterity check. On failure fall 10 feet to corridor below, taking 1d6 falling damage and landing prone; damage can be reduced by 1/2 on a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
 
However, if anyone makes it into the workshop, a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will reveal some gems: **a topaz (15 gp), three quartz (10 gp each), and a small pile of chalyte dust (40 gp, or can be used to power magic at a cost).**
