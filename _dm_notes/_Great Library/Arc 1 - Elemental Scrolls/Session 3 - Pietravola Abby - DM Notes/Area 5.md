This is the cloister. Easy encounter with some zombie animals here, no treasure to find.
 
_You enter a large, square open space in the middle of the Abbey. On each of the four sides a walkway lined with columns opens into a courtyard. The cloisters are more intact than you would expect from the state of ruin of the dining area. While the western walls are cracked and the roof destroyed, the three other sides are largely intact. It looks almost like some kind of blast destroyed the western side of courtyard -- there are stones scattered into the middle of the courtyard. You can here a gnawing sound from behind the rocks._

In the courtyard are three **beggar ghouls** gnawing on the bones of rats. They will attack but quickly flee if they take damage.

In the courtyard, a search reveals the broken remains of mosaics that used to cover the cloister walls. The party can collect the pieces of valuable metal and gems, worth **30 gp**.
 
Like all other undead in the Abbey, they can only be fully destroyed if burned, purified with holy water, or "cured" with dispel magic. Otherwise, they will reanimate eventually (if "All killed undead reanimate" is rolled).
 
**Developments**. If the beggar ghasts are not killed, they will flee to **Room 3** and the outside where they will hunt for food. They are starving and will not return to crypt until they eat some flesh. If the party has horses or animals, chance they will be attacked.
