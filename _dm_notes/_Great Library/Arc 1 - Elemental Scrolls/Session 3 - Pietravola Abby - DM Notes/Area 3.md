This is the ruins of the main dining hall, kitchen, and common room; upstairs was the sleeping quarters and work rooms. This area
 
_This was once the main hall and common area of a thriving community, but now is little more than ruins. The roof is mostly collapsed, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. To the south, you can see what was once maybe a kitchen, with a small, mostly intact room to the side. The walls to the east glow faintly, and you can see the bodies of several dead humans and a few dogs scattered across the room in various states of decay._
 
If a magic user spends more than 5 minutes in this room, the dead bodies will begin to rise up seek out their magical energy.
 
There are **5 zombies** and **2 zombie dogs** (use stats for Worgs, but reduce AC to 10 and speed to 30ft and give undead fortitude and +2 to wis saves) here. Roll for each zombie to determine which magic user catches its attention - they will unerringly head for that PC, attacking others only if they do not have sufficient movement to reach their target and the other PC is in the way.
 
They can only be fully destroyed if burned, purified with holy water, or "cured" with dispel magic. Otherwise, they will reanimate eventually (if "All killed undead reanimate" is rolled).
 
There is no treasure in this room, although some iron cooking gear can be found in the kitchen area.
