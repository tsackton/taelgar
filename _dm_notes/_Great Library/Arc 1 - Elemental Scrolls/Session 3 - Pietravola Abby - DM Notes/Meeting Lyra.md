_Adrik, Samso, Brelith, and Aglath are eating lunch together in the Purple Pig Inn, where you have been put up by the Great Library in Voltara, waiting for news from Archivist Lyra. As you finish your meal, the Archvist sweeps into the inn, walking carefully and haughtly. With her are two people you don't recognize. "These two are new recruits for the Great Library, just arrived in town. They will be joining you from time to time."_
 
**Let Abbey and Owen and anyone else describe their characters.**
 
_After introductions, the Archivist frowns. "We have not had luck finding records of the final two elemental scrolls. However, Mistspeaker Arion was known to spend time at the Pietravola Abby, not far from here. While it has been ruined for two hundred years, records, books, or notes may remain. Please go there and return with any books or notes you can find. You have been marginally competent so far, and I have no one else here to assign this task._
 
_But be careful! The Abby is rumored to be haunted, and at night flashes of purple light are occasionally seen from the Abby. Do not linger longer than you must, and be sure to be back by nightfall! I suggest that you prepare this evening, and leave at first light."_
 
_With that, she turns and strides out the door._
 
**Players can talk (in character), buy gear, and otherwise make whatever arrangements they would like for the next 3-4 hours.**
