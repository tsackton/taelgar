Choir of church. Ghoul/zombie encounter here. Ghoul will run, zombies won't of course. Zombie rats.
 
_You come into a large octagonal space, with high walls and an intact, arched ceiling decorated with images of the Eightfold Aspects of Arha and Malik. While faded and cracked in places, this part of the church is more intact than almost anywhere else, and retains a slight bit of a sense of the divine._
 
_In the center of the room are a series of destroyed and rotting wooden pews, leading to a large central stone altar. Around the six side walls of the choir are smaller alters, each dedicated to one aspect of the Divine: the Father, the Mother, the_ **ADD OTHERS.** _The far wall, behind the central altar, has two small shrines in alcoves, one dedicated to the Wildling and one to the Wyrdling. There are stairs leading down against the north wall._
 
_As you enter, you hear a gnawing sound coming from behind the central altar, and the scurrying of small creatures. What do you do?_
 
Creatures are 1 **zombie**, 2 **zombie rats**, and 1 **swarm of zombie rats.** Zombie rats use Giant Rat stats but -2 AC, +7 HP, -10 speed and gain undead fortitude and Wis saving throw + 2.
 
Swarm of zombie rats uses swarm of rats stats, but with -10 speed, 35 HP, and gain the trait "Unkillable swarm: when swarm takes damage (unless fire or radiant), it must make a CON saving throw with DC = 5 + damage taken. On success, it instead takes no damage."
 
The ghoul will flee if it takes damage and join the pack of ghouls in area 9. The zombies will fight to the death.
 
They can only be fully destroyed if burned, purified with holy water, or "cured" with dispel magic. Otherwise, they will reanimate eventually (if "All killed undead reanimate" is rolled).
 
Searching the area will uncover miscellaneous religious accoutrements, some destroyed and some worthless but some with value. A Intelligence (Religion) check can determine what would be worth selling (value of items recovered equal to twice [Die roll - 10]). On a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check, will also find a silver amulet (holy symbol of the Mother) worth **10 gp**, and two vials of **Holy Water**.
