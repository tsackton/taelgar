Nave of church. Badly damaged. No treasure, nothing really to find.
 
_This is the nave of the church of the Eightfold Gods that once was the centerpiece of life in the Abbey. Bare walls stand below the gray sky, the empty shell of windows that once held stained glass open to the outside._
 
_There are two doorways on the south side of the building, and ahead is the choir and central altar of the church, under a still mostly intact roof._
 
There is not really anything to find here, but if party searches can throw out a few large candle holders, broken glass, etc.
 
[as they continue to the choir, mention: ]
 
_As you continue towards the choir, you see two large gaping holes in the floor, revealing a glimpse of the crypt below._
