_The morning dawns clear and warm with a hint of summer in the air, but looming clouds suggest rain is in store._
 
Anything you want to do this morning before leaving? Everybody have spells selected?
 
_The journey to the Abby is quick, not more than a 2 hour walk from town towards one of the mining outposts in the hills, along a well-maintained road. The journey is uneventful, passing mostly bare fields waiting for planting, and the occasional flock of sheep, some with newborn lambs in tow._
 
_The Abby is set high on a bare hillside. From the road, you can see that most of the structure has collapsed, and only a section of the church and parts of the cloisters seem to be intact. There is a winding switchback path that leaves the road and ascends the steep side of the cliff._
 
What do you want to do?
 
[let them set marching order up the path -- it is only wide enough for a single file line]

[To divine spellcasters]:  
_As you reach about the halfway point on the trail up to the Abby, you feel a cold sensation sweep over you, almost like a shadow falling between you and your God [or the magical energy of Nature]. It passes quickly, but leaves you feeling uneasy._
 
[To arcane spellcasters]:  
_At the half way point on the trail, you feel a hot pulse of energy course through you. You get a feeling of power, like magical energy crackling at your fingertips, tinged with queasiness. The feeling quickly passes, but it leaves your magical senses tingling._
 
[both]  
_You can feel a magical tension in the air, like a coiled spring that could launch at any moment._

When they reach the top:
 
_As you reach the top of the path, you can see the ruined Abby before you. Straight ahead, you can see the main building of the Abby, centered around the church and the cloisters. The church is a long building, the front entrance crumbled and ruined, but the octagonal choir still partially intact. The ruins of the Abby building abut the church; a large portion of the front is also crumbling, with the roof collapsed and a gaping hole in the wall into the common room, but the rear and the cloisters seem relatively intact. To your left is a small outbuilding mostly in ruins, and to your right is a second small building, largely intact, abutting the ruins of the Abby._
