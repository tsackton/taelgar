**Chalyte Effects**
 
The monks here were experimenting with chalyte, and a mystical explosion has left the entire area pulsing with weird energy. It will occasionally go off in strange ways.
 
While the party is exploring the Abby, every time they do something that takes more than a few minutes, add a 1d6 to the magic pool. When the pool has 6 dice in it, roll them the next time "time passes". For each die showing a 1, roll on the Chalyte Effects table. If no die show a 1, roll again when "time passes" until something happens, at which point clear the magic pool.
 
A "bad thing" chalyte effect should always be preceded by a purplish flash.

**Casting Spells**
 
The whole idea behind chalyte is that it is a source of power, but one that is dangerous. When someone casts a leveled spell, there is a chance that it will be stronger than normal, but at a cost. It does not affect Divine magic, only arcane magic.
 
[for Arcane magic - bards, wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, etc]  
When you cast a leveled spell, roll a 1d10. If the number is \<= (spell level +1), the caster has the option to cast it as if using a spell slot of 1 higher level (if that would have no effect in the description, make something up). However, the caster must also make a DC 12 + spell level + 1 CON saving throw; if the fail, their hit point maximum is reduced by 2*spell level. Each long rest restores 1 hp to their hp maximum until recovered.
