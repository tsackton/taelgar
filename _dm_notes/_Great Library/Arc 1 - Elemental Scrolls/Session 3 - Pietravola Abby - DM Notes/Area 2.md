This used to be the storeroom / pantry.
 
_This room seems to have been a pantry or storeroom at one point. Along the south and west walls are the crumbled remains of wooden shelves, mostly splintered to pieces. On the north side, see you several piles of rubble on the ground. Although you can see the shattered remains of chests and barrels, nothing useable is immediately apparent._
 
While this room is mostly full of junk and ruins, a careful search will reveal a small locked chest. Inside the chest is **38 gp, 410 sp, and 860 cp** of old, tarnished coins, two **potions of greater healing**, one **potion of resistance to necrotic,** one **potion of climbing**, and one **potion of poison**, which is a spoiled potion of healing. A DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana | Medicine | Perception) check reveals it is poison, otherwise it seems to be a potion of healing.
 
The chest can be found with a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or if a character spends 10 minutes clearing rubble to look underneath.
 
The chest is a small locked wooden chest. The lock is rusted and hard to open, but can be picked with a DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. Alternatively, the chest can be bashed open (AC 15, HP 10). On a critical failure on an attack roll, a potion bottle (randomly determined; d10 1-4 healing, 5-6 resistance, 7-8 climbing, 9-10 poison) breaks.
