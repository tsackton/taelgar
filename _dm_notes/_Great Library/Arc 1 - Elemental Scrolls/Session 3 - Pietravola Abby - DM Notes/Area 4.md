4A: Private library of Abbess
 
_This is a small, largely intact room that was perhaps a study or private library. On the west wall is a broken, rotting wooden bookshelf. Slumped against a miraculously intact large oaken desk on the east wall is the dead body of a older human woman in gray robes. As you enter, a wave of longing passes over you, and a ghostly figure rises from the body. She looks as you imagine the body may be been in life, wearing gray robes and the ethereal echo of a large holy symbol of the Sibyl around her neck. She turns, and in a ghostly whisper says: "Visitors! I wasn't told! Andapa, bring some food and refreshment for our guests!"_
 
_Then, a wave of anger and loneliness washes over the room, and the voice turns cold and gasping. "No, no, that was before, a long time ago. All is changed now and we have only ourselves to blame. Careful, this place is no longer safe for travelers! All is changedâ€¦."_
 
_What do you do?_
 
The Abbess can rely the following information:  
-Windspeaker Arion did spend a lot of time her. She has a collection of letters she will give to party (with decent roleplaying or an easy DC 10 persuasion check). There are also some books in the crypt that may have survived.  
-The order was exploring the properties of a magical gemstone called chalyte, and triggered an explosion. Those who were killed by the blast cannot die, except by fire or holy magic (radiant energy).  
-She cannot rest while her order is a danger to the world. There were twelve nuns here who died in the blast; if they are all burned she can leave in peace to be with Arha.  
-If the party does this, they are free to take the treasure in the crypt  
-maybe also make up some random history, etc  
-she can also give the party some protection from chalyte energy flashes, on a DC 15 persuasion check or really good roleplaying; can give information only on DC 10 check
 
-also a safe area for a short rest with Abbess blessing; does not require rolling the time pool
 
4B:
 
This is the ruins of a library; the window is missing and all the books are ruined. A DC 15 perception check revels three **spell scrolls** (Protection from Evil and Good; Prayer of Healing, Lesser Restoration)
