**Scene 1: Ambush on the Road!**  
_It’s been a long journey. You met in the bustling, cosmopolitan city of Chardon, drawn to the call for explorers and treasure-seekers put out by the Great Library. Then, the trip north. First by ship across the stormy spring seas, then by horseback, then ship again, fortunately sailing on calm seas, and then the long hike inland by foot. This morning your escorts turned for Voltara, warning you about the dangers on the road. But you still have another few hours walk in the growing twilight gloom and the dust of what passes for a road out here through the scrubby foothills of the Fiamatara before you meet you contact, Archivist Lyra. What’s worse, as you ascend a steep hill through a small stand of oaks, you hear the thwack of an arrow striking a tree across the path and whirl around to see a small, greenish humanoid in ratty leather armor jump behind a tree. Goblins! Roll initiative!_   
Combat: 4 goblins. Tactics: [http://themonstersknow.com/goblin-tactics/](http://themonstersknow.com/goblin-tactics/)

Goblins will hang back trying to hide and shoot arrows. While wielding shortbow they cannot use a shield, so have AC 13.   
If goblins defeat the party, they will take there stuff and leave them unconscious. Early the next morning they will come to, Lyra around.   
**Notes -- in game** the goblins are part of the Red Knife tribe which raids this territory; there are hobgoblin tribes that are lord over them too.**  
**Scene 2: The Archivist’s camp**  
After defeating the goblins, party can continue to Archivist Lyra’s camp, where she has food, water, shelter, and can provide magical healing if needed (be a bit squishy about Lyra’s class and abilities for now).   
_You stumble into a makeshift camp an hour after dark, the fire, food, ale, and friendly faces a welcome sight. Sitting at the fire is a tall, lanky woman, with long blonde hair, dressed in fine robes. She stares at you with a commanding gaze, saying, “Ah. We have been expecting you. Sit, eat, and rest. We’ll talk business shortly.”_ _With that, she stands and strides to her tent, leaving you to roast meat, ale, and hard biscuits._  
If PCs want to do anything, they can.  
_The Archivist returns, and examines you for a minute before shaking her head a bit and muttering, “I guess they’ll have to do.”_   
_“So. You know that many generations ago, there was a great war against a evil dragon of world-destroying power. As part of this battle, he unleashed a magical plague of destructive power, and a massive hobgoblin army that poured out of the North, unleashing decades of war, known as the Blood Years. Much was lost that was once know. We in the Great Library seek to restore that knowledge to the world.”_  
_“Many years ago, before the Blood Years, a wizard named Arion the Mistspeaker studied deep in the the elemental mysteries, learning much about the magical essence of the pure elements. He recorded some of his insights on four scrolls: the Flamekeeper Scroll, the Stonemaster Scroll, the Skyborn Scroll, and the Deepwater Scroll. We would like you to recover these items for us.”_  
_“Arion lived in the former kingdom of Amani, on whose land you now stand. My research has revealed critical information about the location of two of the scrolls, but you will need to search for the others.”_  
She hands you a piece of paper with her notes scrawled on it, and a map.   
_“If you succeed in this task, you will be well compensated and earn my favor and trust. I will be leaving for Voltara at dawn. When you find the first scroll, bring it to me. I will be waiting.”_  
Before they go to bed, party can ask Lyra some questions. She departs at first light with her two guards.   
**Scene 3: Decisions**  
The party will need to decide what to do and which clue to follow.  
Let them discuss amongst themselves, but don’t let it go on too long.   
****************  
**The Forge of Fire (location of the Flamekeeper Scroll):**  
The Forge of Fire is located near the foot of an active volcano in the [[Fiamatara Mountains]], in the location of a former Dwarven forge and hall. This is goblin territory, although they tend not to attack during the day. There are occasional bands of hobgoblins in this area, though. Improv some travel through the increasingly mountainous terrain. Give them an opportunity to explore a bit and poke some of the environment. Maybe spot a patrol in the distance. If they are being particularly noisy and uncautious, might get attacked by a hobgoblin + two goblins or something like that.  
The terrain should get increasing steep, becoming rough terran when they head for the mountains.   
It is about a day’s travel at a slow pace (watching for danger). If they go faster, can there sooner but may risk trouble.   
Terrain starts as low hills but gets increasingly difficult as they see the taller mountains rising in the distance. One of the volcanoes is active, with a thin trickle of smoke.   
As they approach their target:  
_As you approach the presumed location of the ruined Dwarven forge, you find the remnants of an old road leading into the hills. The road slopes up to a ledge on the side of the mountain, with no obvious doors._  
_(if passive perception \>= 15, or active searching perception DC 12): Small reptilian footprints lead off the road to some small tunnels, maybe 2-3’ wide._   
Finding the Secret Doors   
There are two secret doors in the face of the mountains: a false one and the real one. The dragon cultists built the false one to deter (or kill) anyone hoping to loot their treasure. Adventurers are likely to search the wall for evidence of an entrance. A character succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check detects the false door. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals both doors, and the adventurers easily notice that one of them (the second door) is much more carefully hidden.   
The false door is trapped with a glyph. When the door is opened, the glyph is exposed and detonates. Anyone within 30 feet of the door takes 7 (2d6) thunder damage, or half of that damage on a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw. The glyph trap can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check and removed with a DC 12 Dexterity (Arcana) check. The blast also starts a rockslide that imperils the adventurers – see Rockslide below. If the adventurers find the false door but not the real door on their first attempt, the real door becomes easier to find based on new circumstances: the opening of the false door loosens some stone, making the real door apparent. So does the explosion of the thunder glyph.   
Rockslide   
If the adventurers set off the thunder glyph, or if the adventurers find neither secret door on their first attempt, their clumsy fumbling triggers a minor rockslide above them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they avoid being hit by stones. On a failure, they take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage as they are pelted with large stones. This rockslide also reveals the presence of the false door. The real secret door, once found, can be easily opened as an action and is neither trapped nor locked. However, the rockslide continues, forcing saving throws from anyone on the ledge, until all the characters are inside.   
[if party enters from secret door]:  
_Opening the secret door leads into an abandoned dwarven outpost. The dust and cobwebs have been disturbed by many footprints—too many to discern the number or type of creatures. The stonework you see in the hallway is centuries old and definitely dwarven crafted. As the hallway turns the corner, you see the room contains four small creatures. They are resting, crouching behind barricades blocking a passage leading south. The barricades are made of broken wooden furniture, and the creatures are on your side of the barricade. A small stone building occupies the center of the room. There are no obvious entrances into the central building, but obvious holes dot the structure._   
Inside, run ==Mission 4 from Adventure League module, with some minor tweaks (kobolds are worshipping “fire god”; like this==

***when updating character sheets make sure everyone has right amount of XP and gold***  
**Reminders for players for next time:**  
**1) I cannot help you remember treasure you get. If you don’t write it down, you don’t have it.**  
**2) To keep things moving, going to try to limit out of character discussion; if you need to discuss strategy, you can do it in character all you want**  
**3) Everyone gets one “do you really want to do that” warning when you do something that might be foolhardy. If you say yes, it happens. I will work to make sure that the consequences of something stupid fall mostly on the character doing it, so one person can’t kill the whole party by being reckless. But I am not going to work really hard to keep you alive if you insist on doing things that would get you killed.**

_A fragment of the battle records of the First Hobgoblin Horde, fighting in Amani in the first decade of the Blood Years:_  
**Today was a strong day, a bloody day. The dwarven forge in the Fire Mountains has been broken by the might of our swords. Our power grows and all fear us.**   
**We broke the forge and slaughtered the cowardly dwarves, but there was another power there, a glyph seemingly protecting some kind of scroll. Creatures of fire stepped out of a river of lava and we left them.**
