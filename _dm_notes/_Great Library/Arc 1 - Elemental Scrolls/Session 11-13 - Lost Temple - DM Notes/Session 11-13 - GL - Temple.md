## Overview

When Xameia burned and stole from her temple, it opened a weakness in the world that allowed the Demon Prince of Greed and Gluttony to leak into the Temple. This energy attracted Kor'ath, a cambion, who has since taken up residence in the ruined temple. Holy wards set by the Order trapped this creature and his demon spawn followers. He has attracted the attention of a small tribe of Xvarts who are bringing food and treasure while he tries to find a way out, and tries to build up a cult following.
 
Parts to adventure:
 
1. In town, finding information and deciding what to do
2. Travel to temple location, need to find it
    1. Travel skill checks and such determine encounter strength
3. First battle - xvart ambush at night
4. Second battle - demon guards
5. Temple puzzle - entry
6. Third battle - Cambion

Start:
 
Return to tavern -- message from Lyra: *At start of session 10, Lyra will have left a message for the party to alert her at once when they return, rather angry they disappeared without notifying her. "Do you work for me, or not?" But she will be sympathetic when she learns that the party was helping lizardfolk, especially when she learns of their plight, and will wax rhapsodic about the plight of the Dunmari.*
 
*When they meet, she will tell them that a messenger is expected from Chardon in the next two weeks, with more information that may lead to the location of the Scroll of Endless Wind. She will warn them not to stray.

## Finding Info

1. [[Galius Filuso]]:
 
Innkeeper or Archivist Lyra can introduce. If they offer him funds/information he can reveal location of temple, but will be a bit skeptical unless good persuasion roll / convincing argument / bribery. Mention of Xameia by name will help/hurt - convince interest is real, worry about context
 
2. Books:
 
With a history roll \>10, will find 1 piece of info, \>15 tplus map
 
3. Rumors of evil:
 
A good persuasinon roll can give info about location


## Aftermath

**NOTES**  
The portal can be destroyed with a _Hallow_ spell. Can tell Marco this, he would know about it. Material cost is I think 1000 gp which they would need provide, and guard the temple for the 24 hour casting time. With demon banished, but Xvart warlock alive, there would likely be a wave of assaults.
 
Will need to defend casters of Hallow for time while they concentrate on spell.
 
On success, portal will vanish, area will begin to heal, and Xameia will rest. She will give them all a blessing of the night queen (functions as death ward, lasts until they drop to 0, then ends).
 
Will make an ally of the order of Twilight, and perhaps also get an (additional) magic item reward -- some disposal items (potions etc).

_After an uneventful, if hurried journey back to town, you find yourself on the outskirts of Voltara, approaching [[the Purple Pig]]._
 
_Behind you lies the ruined temple of the Order of Twilight, with a portal to the Abyss in the crypt below, awaiting your attention._
 
_From the Temple, you have some silver chalices and other religious artifacts, a mysterious shadow cloak, a mysterious prayer necklace with three large gems, and some red gemstones, gold and silver that seemed to have been collected by the demon you fought._
 
_Knowing you need to find someone willing and able to cast a Hallow spell to remove the portal, you approach town._
 
**Errands in town**

1. Get items identified - will cost 50 gp per item for identify spell; **make up a name** for a wizard, who will note the history and tell them about [[Galius Filuso]].
2. Find someone to cast Hallow. This could be [[Galius Filuso]], who will be interested and only request the return of the temple silver (will tell them to keep magic items), plus 1500 gp (for material components and other costs for restorting temple)
 
**Other events in town**

1. Rumors of kidnapping and tolls will be common -- the goblins are stirring up trouble. Definitely people are upset, especially as trade shortages from the mountains are leading to trouble getting things from the coast.
2. Archivist Lyra will tell them the messenger was expected a few days ago. Still early enough to not be too worried, but given rumors of kidnapping starting to wonder.
 
**Back at the Temple**

1. First they will have opportunity to search the temple again, with some guidance from [[Galius Filuso]].
2. Also will have an opportunity to set some defenses
3. Three battles:
    1. Will need to reclear crypt of some minor demons
    2. Xvart attack in middle of night
    3. Second demon assault when they sense portal closing
 
If anyone gets through, and attacks Galius, each hit means concentration check, on a failure spell ends. He will make short work of battle, but will need to start spell again, with new material components (which means journey back to town).
 
Design these battles all to be challenging. If they are creative about setting up defenses and using all their resources should be beatable, but should be good chance of getting through to Galius (although not of dying, because if Galius loses concentration on Hallow he will join the fight).
   

_Demon battle 1 - those that have come back, mostly minor demons_
 
4 Abyssal Wretch  
3 Rutterkin

**Final aftermath**
 
On success, portal will vanish, area will begin to heal, and Xameia will rest.
 
The Night Queen will appear to each of them, and give each an appropriate blessing:
 
_For Brelith, dedicated servant of my Dwarven brethren and friend of the Wildling. To you I give the blessing of my ear. You may ask me in prayer a question that I can answer with a single word, and I will answer truthfully to the best of my knowledge. I grant you my attention thrice before it warns._ [You can ask three questions -- at same or different time -- and then the blessing ends, as the commune spell]
 
_For Aelar, who hides between darkness and light, where I also dwell, and who has forged a long road through suffering and war to find strength in the twilight. I grant you the blessing of the shadows. When you seek not to be seen, I will aid you if you falter. I can extend my protection over you 5 times before the blessing fades._ [A stealth roll less than 10 can be treated as a 10, until you have used this ability 5 times]
 
_For Adrik, stalwart warrior on the front lines of danger, I grant you my blessing of safety. Let the Night Queen watch over you in danger, and should you falter I will catch you._ [After receiving this blessing, when you drop to 0 hit points, the damage is negated. After using this blessing, it ends]
 
_For Samso, friend of wild things, kin to beasts, from a race that is no stranger to the power of dreams, I grant you some measure of control over my domain of sleep. I grant you my blessing of dreams._ [lets you cast the Dream spell once with no components, then the blessing ends]
 
Will make an ally of the order of Twilight. They will give potions and other consumables when back in town, and also will assist with getting access to Voltara / favor with pro-consul.
