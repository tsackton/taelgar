Stopped approaching the dead zone around the temple
 
One xvart warlock got away so demons will be on alert. Rolled good perception checks so won't necessarily be surprised though.


## Session Start

_In the morning light after battling a horde of Xvarts, you start heading up the faint, rutted path to the ruined temple of the Order of the Twilight._
