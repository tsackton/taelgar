_It is late morning. A few minutes ago, the last of the demon spawn fell, sizzling and smoking into nothing as they died. You find yourself standing at the entrance to a ruined temple, exhausted and licking your wounds._
 
_[I think at least two players were poisoned - Owen and Sasha? Confirm and then update description with rotting flesh and flies buzzing; make save at end of long rest, lose 1d4 HP off max if fail]_
 
_From where you stand, you can see the roof of the temple has completely collapsed, but the tall stone columns running in two rows down the nave still stand. At the far end, the transept is more intact, and parts of a roof still stand over the alter and choir._
 
_The entire cathedral, however, is wreathed in dark energy. Everywhere you look, rotting grass and vegetation grasp at stones. The light here is dim, despite the time of day. And a cold gray mist seems to hang in the air, keeping you from seeing any detail of the scene in front of you._
 
_What do you do?_

**Parts of the Temple:**
 
1. **Ruined Nave**
2. **Transept**
3. **Choir**
4. **Alter**

1. The Nave:
 
Exploring the nave does not reveal anything of particular interest. Some religious iconography is scattered about, destroying. A DC 13 Religion check reveals this is indeed the symbols of the order of the twilight. A DC 15 investigation check reveals a golden chalice among the ruins, which if properly cleaned and restored would be worth 60 gp.
 
1. Transept
 
Two small chapels used to form the ends of the transept. One (to the left facing the alter) is buried under a pile of rubble and stone. If the rubble could be removed, underneath are four silver candlesticks (15 gp each). On the right (facing the alter), you see:
 
_This seems like it was once a small chapel with a basin of water for blessings and prayers. Somehow the holiness of the basin has remained, for here you see green plants growing and can feel the warm sun on your faces through the crumbling ceiling._
 
Basin is dry, but water poured into it becomes holy.  
Searching here will reveal a scroll case, containing a _Scroll of Sanctuary_ and a _Scroll of Protection from Good and Evil_. To find the case requires an Investigation or Perception check of DC 15. Allow only one person to roll, with advantage if multiple people look.
 
1. Choir
 
This is where the hole down to the crypt stand, at the back of the choir. In contrast to the transept, this is the darkest place, and the one with the most evil feeling.
 
_As you approach the choir, you feel as if the demonic presence here is trying to force its way into your brain, to confuse and frighten you. Behind the altar, a cracked flagstone on the floor reveals a dark drop into the crypt below, which seems to be the source of the demonic presence. A series of symbols in a language you do not recognize are etched around the hole in the ground._
 
Have everyone make a Wisdom saving throw, against a DC of 13. Anyone who fails has disadvantage on ability checks while in the choir.
 
To get down to the choir requires three things:

1. Rope / some means of descent (stairs are gone)
2. Disabling the wards to prevent alarm
3. Disabling unholy shield to prevent damage  
Relevant skill checks:
 
DC 12 Arcana check to recognize writing as Abyssal, and as wards  
DC 15 Religion check to realize that holy water will disable the wards, and also that their meaning is gives them power and disrupting their form will disrupt their ability (partial info on DC 10 success)  
DC 17 Perception check, or DC 14 investigation check, to detect barrier before touching  
DC 13 Religion check to realize that holy symbol will stop barrier temporarily but not permanently, as will holy water or other contact with holy items  
DC 12 sleight of hand check to destroy runes safely
 
Failure to destroy runes safely triggers alarm when passing through -- Cambion will set ambush  
Failure to disable unholy shield triggers damage when passing through - anyone who touches barrier will take 1d6 necrotic damage.
 
If alarm is not triggered they will have a chance of surprising Cambion.
 
1. Altar
 
_The altar at the center of the temple was once beautiful, but is now a sad sight. The large marble central block has a crack down the middle, and has been defaced with evil-looking writing. A silver censer (incense burner) lays smashed on the floor, and a large silver icon of a three interlocking crescent moons lies fallen but untouched on the ground._
 
The altar can be repaired, and anyone who prays at the altar and offers a sincere donation (of money, blood, treasure, or even just kind words) will have lesser restoration cast on them (works once per cycle of the moon per person). In addition, once per cycle of the moon a prayer and offering of something meaningful to the Night Queen will allow one casting of prayer of healing.
 
To repair alter - crack needs to be fixed, mending spell will work, or mold earth  
Writing needs to be cleaned - holy water  
The crescent moon symbol needs to be cleaned and placed on the altar
