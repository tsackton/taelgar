Room 1: Main chamber
 
_You drop from the ruined temple above into a crypt. As you enter, you can feel the heat around you, and the bubbling and hissing sound suggests that lava is near. The oppressive darkness is light only by the warm glow of the lava, and a few torches burning._
 
_The room you are in is a large hexagonal space, with four exits: one north, one south, one east, and one west. A central dais stands in the middle of the room, a cracked and splintered mausoleum atop it. In the corner, lava bubbles under cracked stones of the floor._
 
_All around you, a foul brimstone stench permeates the air, causing you to choke and cough at the foul odor. This is not a pleasant place._
 
_What do you want to do?_
 
There is little to find in the main room. It has been largely destroyed by the demonic influence of the portal. Examining the destroyed mausoleum will reveal that it has archaic Chardonian writing on it, but all broken up and hard to piece together. Seems to be part of name, and their of pieces of what might say "Dedicated by Xameia, Protector of Evensong and Dusk Guide of the Night Queen." Can let them decipher with a DC 11 history (if proficient) or straight INT check. Otherwise give partial info but include name.
 
[unless they are very stealthy, Cambion in room 3 will hear them and attempt to surprise them. If they trigger alarm, will also attempt surprise]
 
Room 2: North chamber
 
Turned into cambion's lair, of sorts. Cared about beauty and decorated with plunder of various kinds, including everything that could be recovered from temple. Treasure includes:
 
Several silver chalices and other religious artifacts, marked with "Order of Twilight" symbol [from temple, taking them is a bit evil -- trying to sell them will result in questions in town]  
Some gemstones, including 2 small rubies, a large garnet, a large red topaz, and a number of small cut polished jasper. In total these gems are probably worth about 360 gp. Also a small purse of 80 gp and 240 sp.  
A necklace of varied gemstones; this is magical. It is a necklace of prayer, containing three magical gems. One can be used to cast lesser restoration, one can store any 1st level spell cast by the attuned wearer, and one can store one spell up to 3rd level cast by the attuned wearer.  
A shadowy cloak of a fine black material, thin and light-absorbing. When you pull the hood up, you become wreathed in shadow, giving you advantage on stealth checks. In addition, once per day you may activate the cloak, causing swirling shadows to billow around you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and while it is active, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.  
[these two are both Order of Twilight artifacts -- also obviously marked, and this is why not being used by Cambion; if temple is restored party will be given them with blessing of the Order, if they take them and don't ask the order will be a bit suspicious]
 
Room 3: Portal room
 
The cambion is here; make sure to play up the fire and chaos of the portal, and the horrible sulfur smell.
 
Cambion will first cast fear, trying to target as many front line fighters as possible. Then it will use its fire ray to pick off spellcasters, using its spear if forced into battle.
 
If they get a long rest, give allies, maybe 2 CR 1 or less demons
 
When reduced below 30 hp, will flee using plane shift.
 
No treasure in here.
 
Room 4: South chamber
 
Thick black ooze throughout chamber, dripping from ceiling, etc. make a trap and a waste of time, everything is corroded / turned to dust.
 
If they enter the room, will slowly start to sink into the ooze, which is corrosive. Will take 1 point of acid damage first few moments, and increasing to 1d4 and then 1d6 as they sink. Once they start to sink, require an athletics check to move at all -- but of course many creative things they could try.
 
Room 5: exit hall
 
Getting over the lava requires a clever idea, an acrobatics check (DC 12); on failure get a Dex save (DC 12), fail both take 4d6 fire damage. Good use of immovable rod can give advantage. If get clear, the doorway is clear and takes them outside to a hidden entrance -- this is a newly carved tunnel that the Xvarts used.
