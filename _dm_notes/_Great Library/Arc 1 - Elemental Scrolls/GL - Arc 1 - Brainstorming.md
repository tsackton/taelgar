## Next adventures (prior to air scroll):
 
The goal of these adventures is to get the party a little deeper into Voltara and provide some connections to new NPCs, new places; mix of some event based and some place based options, with a little bit more of a sandbox feel. Ultimately this should build towards getting info about air scroll. Should also involve the non-humans in the area more, especially orc tribes on the plains. Goal is to get them to level 4 prior to air scroll adventure.
 
- Orc raiding (event-based, escalating):
    - Orcs are getting a little desperate on the plains and increasingly looking to raid near Voltara. Mines are the obvious target, and so quick raids on mines and on caravans leaving mines are increasing.
    - This could start with rumors that they may or may not decide to explore. If they don't explore, then could escalate until a battered caravan comes into town sputtering about attacks
    - Eventually rumor could get around that one of the mining operators is paying a lot for adventurers to recover chalyte from orc tribe.
- Voltara sewers (event-based, escalating):
    - Chalyte is dangerous and some of the chalyte refining in Voltara is causing a slow drip of trouble in the sewers.
    - This could start with rumors of people disappearing and an opportunity to gain access to the city to go see what's happening in a certain hidden part of the sewers
    - If rumors are ignored, could start causing more trouble for people living in Voltara and eventually lead to an explosion or disaster of some kind in which case emergency request for help could go out
- Kidnapped messenger (event-based, required):
    - When ready to run the air scroll adventure, have Archivist Lyra find the party, and inform them that more information about the final scroll was expected to arrive in a party from Chardon more than a week ago, but they haven't been seen. Will need to search for missing messenger and clues.
    - The messenger was captured by [[kobolds]], who are trying to get money and power to protect themselves from goblins/hobgoblins in mountains
    - Adventure based on infiltrating kobold camp, but should be options for rescue that don't involve just combat.
- Place-based adventures (rumors of these options will circulate):
    - Mostly search for drop-in online one-shots, focus design effort on orc raiding, Voltara sewers, and kidnapped messangers

## Air scroll adventure:
 
This will be a two or three parter to give time for a more engaged experience. Will be a dungeon in the mountains, starting with a cave that leads to an endless stair, ascending to an ice cavern in a glacier, where an ice bridge leads to a floating castle/manor/fort/tower in which the air scroll is found. Should start at level 4, and get to level 5 after finale.
 
Parts:

- The clues and finding the cave
- Exploring the cave to the endless stair
- Climbing the stair
- Ice cave and glacier area, including ice bridge
- Floating castle/manor/etc
