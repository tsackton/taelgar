"Do you work for me, or not?" But she will be sympathetic when she learns that the party was helping lizardfolk, especially when she learns of their plight, and will wax rhapsodic about the plight of the Dunmari.*
 
*When they meet, she will tell them that a messenger is expected from Chardon in the next two weeks, with more information that may lead to the location of the Scroll of Endless Wind. She will warn them not to stray.*
