## Air scroll adventure:
 
This will be a two or three parter to give time for a more engaged experience. Will be a dungeon in the mountains, starting with a cave that leads to an endless stair, ascending to an ice cavern in a glacier, where an ice bridge leads to a floating castle/manor/fort/tower in which the air scroll is found. Should start at level 4, and get to level 5 after finale.
 
Parts:

- The clues and finding the cave
- Exploring the cave to the endless stair
- Climbing the stair
- Ice cave and glacier area, including ice bridge
- Floating castle/manor/etc
 
Town: done  
Kobold lair: done  
Journey: done  
Cave: done
 
Endless Stair: crystal / magic, with landings and haunted Dwarves. Mostly narrative, but have some spooky magic stuff and some undead dwarf encounters, perhaps stolen from Taelgar Revisited
 
Emerge into a glacier:  
--need a cold / survival mechanic  
--path to castle should be clear, there is a ice bridge in the distance, but environmental hazards are in the way  
--play up snow / ice combat, maybe also elemental stuff? Yetis? Frost giants?
 
Ice bridge should be challenging encounter with opportunity to recover after.
 
The tower itself:  
--puzzle, mad mage style  
--final boss is a mini-lich type spellcasting undead, with air elementals (should be 6th level here)
 
Find air scroll, potentially have to fight Grumella's troop on way out
