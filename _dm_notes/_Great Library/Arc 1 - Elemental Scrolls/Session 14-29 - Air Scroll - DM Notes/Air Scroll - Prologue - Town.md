**Set up**
 
_You have been back in Voltara for less than 12 hours, barely getting a chance to sleep and recover, when Dravia, the proprietor of the Purple Pig knocks at your door:_
 
_"Sorry to disturb you, sirs, but you have an urgent visitor. She says it can't wait."_
 
_You head downstairs to the main room of the inn, where you see Archivist Lyra sitting at a table waiting for you. She looks up, almost with a half-smile on her face._
 
_"My friends! News of your deeds has spread, and the Proconsul would like to meet you. You have an audience in two hours, and must be ready to go. I could not delay this, but after you meet with him we must talk, as news has come to me as well."_
 
-have a bit of time to chat, can ask questions but she will basically shut them down saying we'll have time to talk later
 
**Proconsul**
 
_An hour later, four guards come to fetch you. They lead you through the main gates of the city. While for Brelith this is not a new experience, for the rest of you it is striking how different the city feels inside the walls. Wide, paved streets lined with white marble buildings; well-dressed citizens walk the streets, many turning to stare as you pass. You travel through a large plaza with an elaborate marble and silver fountain in the design of four large dolphins; water ripples in the fountain below in the warm early summer breeze._
 
_You arrive at the busy administrative complex in Voltara. A series of white marble buildings, open spaces between them, surround a small, bustling square. The guards lead you into one of the larger buildings and into a small audience chamber with an elaborate inlaid floor. Seated at a wooden chair at one end is a tall, tanned man, bald and clearly aging, but with sharp eyes and a wiry frame. The guards quickly take up places along the sides of the room, and the man speaks:_
 
_"Welcome to Voltara. I have heard rumor of your deeds and decided I must see this band of adventures for myself. It is true that you defeated a demon lord and closed a portal to the Abyss? Speak!"_
 
-some conversation proceeds; if they are well-mannered and honest he will ask them if there is a boon they would ask of him, and perhaps will grant it if it is reasonable (access to town, for example)  
-if they seem reasonable and skilled he will tell them, as the audience ends:
 
_"My time grows short I must turn to my next appointment. But you have impressed me. I may have need of skilled adventures soon; as you know the orc threat has been growing and disrupting trade to the south."_
 
**Lyra**
 
Lyra will meet them back at the inn.
 
_As you return from town, Archivist Lyra is waiting at the Purple Pig. As you enter, she says:_
 
_"I hope you were respectful and honest; you are my known associates and your behavior reflects on me, you know."_
 
[some conversation, she will steer towards mission]
 
_"I have important news. We have received a ransom demand from the a group of kobolds calling themselves the Death Inferno Clan, requiring 500 gold, or our messenger will be killed. This must be the messenger we were expecting from Chardon, bringing critical information regarding the location of the Skyborn Scroll, the last one we need to find._
 
_The library is willing to pay this money in order to facilitate a quick retrieval of this critical information. I need you to bring the gold west to the meeting location along the road to the coast [she hands you a map with the location sketched crudely in charcoal, but clear enough]. Make sure that the messenger and the information he is carrying is retrieved! The messenger alone is not enough, we must have the location of the scroll as well. And be careful - kobolds are notorious tricksters and cunning foes when they want to be. Do not underestimate them!"_
 
-time for questions, etc  
-the handover location is on the western road, close to where the road passes the [[Fiamatara Mountains]]  
-she will give them 500 gold plus 200 extra for "complications"
 
**Journey**
 
-time to do whatever in town, but assume they set out this day  
-journey is uneventful, narrate a bit and then have them get to the site marked on map  
-pick up at "ransom site" on kobold lair map
