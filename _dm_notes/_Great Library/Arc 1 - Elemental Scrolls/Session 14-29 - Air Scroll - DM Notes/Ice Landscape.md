Overview:
 
Glacier, ice field, natural hazards, yeti, magical traps/chalyte/Airion's defenses
 
Basic plan:
 
The party stands at the edge of the dwarven stronghold, looking out to the mountains. The peak ahead is wreathed in storms, and the area in front of you is swirling snow and ice. They have come out a few thousand feet below the summit, and can see above them the storms that wreath the peak, etc.
 
Arion's tower is near the peak of the mountain, into the storm and across a glacier, to a bridge to the flying tower. The challenges are:
 
1. Finding the path to the bridge
 
They have a few options here. One, they can just head for the storms. This is totally viable. Give them a random encounter (maybe yetis, remohranz, etc), and have them have to make 2-3 survival checks. If they fail, they get lost, and maybe enter the storms at a disadvantage (exhaustion?).
 
Alternatively, there is some kind of hermit here who will lead them by hidden paths, but first they need to deal with a problem for him (yetis or something else). They can long rest safely in his cave/hut, if desired.
 
1. Dealing with winter wolves tracking them
 
Once they enter the storms, give them a chance to notice that winter wolves are tracking them. This should feel scary and dangerous even though the combat is not that hard, since everything is obscured and visibility is low. Maybe stat up hermit as an NPC and have him with them, adding a wolf or two?
 
Can also deal with this by setting a trap of some kind. Winter wolves can sense their passage but can be fooled.
 
1. Crossing the glacier
 
At the glacier, the hermit will leave them and they will need to cross it. Figure out how this is a challenge.
 
1. Defeating the guardian
 
This will be tough since they won't have been able to get a long rest.
 
1. Crossing the bridge through the storms
 
This should be more narratively scary than actually scary. Make sure there is a safe place to rest in the tower.

## Start
 
_As you step out of the massive stone doors into the blinding light of day, an icy landscape stretches before you. Snow, ice, and rocks form a broken landscape on the side of the mountain, and above you, storms linger, shrouding the peak -- and the presumed location of the tower of Arion the Mistspeaker and the air scroll -- in clouds._
 
_Passing by the doors about a hundred feet away is, surprisingly, a small rock cairn that seems to be marking a trail leading to an outcropping of black rocks, maybe 1/2 mile distant along the side of the mountain._
 
_Looking up towards the summit, you think you can see a glimpse of the arch of a bridge leading into the sky._
 
If they follow the trail, run encounter with Dinia.
 
If they head up the mountain, run the path to the bridge encounter.
 
## Dinia
 
Old woman, bent over, cackling. Completely not surprised to see them, but acts like she kind of forgot how to speak. Wearing huge piles of furs, with a polar bear trailing behind her. Walks slowly.
 
She will let them rest in her cave if they want; it is warm and cozy and seems bigger on the inside.
 
She will tell them "So, you are looking for the tower, hmmm? Others are as well, yes, yes. Can show you the way, I can. Yes. The path. But I need something from you first."
 
She will ask them to kill the abominable yeti that have been killing beasts on the mountains. She can point towards its icy cave lair. It likes to knock out and freeze prey for later, so be aware of what may be lurking there.
 
She is a Northlander, and a worshipper of the Old Gods.
 
Dinia's story:  
_Azzan - northlander hero_  
_Ikos - Chardonian friend_  
_Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies._
 
## Yeti
 
She will tell them how to get to the yeti cave, which is slightly down the mountain. Can hear the grinding and howling in the distance. Roll 1d6, on 1-2 a storm blows up reducing visibility.
 
In the yeti cave there is a dead caribu, and a polar bear knocked unconscious. If the polar bear is healed, will fight against the yeti.
 
No other treasure here.
 
If they kill the yeti and free the polar bear, Dinia will reward them with a few gems and potions. Each person can choose potion of greater healing or a potion of cold resistance. No matter what, she will give them lots of warnings about the glacier -- stay close, stay tied together, watch out for falling seracs and crevasses, stay off it in the sun as the warming sun makes it more dangerous.
 
## Wolves
 
When they leave Dinia's a storm will spring up. A group of wolves will track the party. Give them rolls to hear the howls behind them. "It sounds like wolves, and they are getting closer."
 
Depending on what they do, this may or may not lead to combat. If they just keep moving the wolves will try to sneak up and ambush them in the snow.
 
Low visibility, obscured conditions make this tough.
   

## Glacier
 
Traversing the glacier requires skill and luck. Roll 1d6, on 1-3 conditions are clear, which makes seracs more dangerous but crevasses less; on 4-6 conditions are whiteout, which makes seracs less likely to fall but crevasses harder to spot.
 
Basic actions of the glacier:
 
**Crevasse:**
 
A crevasse in the ice appears in front of you. DC to spot is 10 + 1d8. Depth is 1d4 x 10 feet. If on a rope, can avoid fall damage if at least 2 people succeed on a DC 10 + depth Strength check.
 
If whiteout conditions, characters have -6 to passive perception and disadvantage on all active perception rolls.
 
Any character who falls more than 20 feet also must make a DC 12 CON save or suffer 1 level of exhaustion and take 1d6 extra cold damage.
 
A crevasse can be navigated around, or crossed. To cross requires constructing some kind of bridge, or attempting a jump (use standard jumping rules). Navigating around requires a DC 12 Survival check.
 
A crevasse can also be hidden (covered with a thin layer of ice). In this case, add 5 to the DC to detect, but depth is max 30 feet. A hidden crevasse with crack when someone steps on it, give them a second to response to the cracking sound. On a DC 14 Dex save, can attempt to jump to safety.
 
**Serac:**
 
A large chunk of ice that can fall, possibly hitting you or causing an avalanche.
 
Hits require attack roll, with a +7 modifier, and do 1d6 bludgeoning + 1d6 cold on a hit. Roll 1d4 for number of chunks that fall. Give party a hint, so they can attempt to take cover.
 
If 3 or 4 chunks fall, roll 1d6. On a 6, an avalanche is triggered. Requires DC 16 Strength save; if they are roped together, only 1 player needs to succeed, but on a DC 18. On failure, swept away and lose 1 check of progress.
 
**Sudden Squall:**
 
Even if it is a clear day, a sudden squall can blow up, causing brief whiteout conditions. Party can stay in place, in which case DC 13 CON save or 1d6 cold damage plus exhaustion. Or they can condition, in which case disadvantage on all checks until squall ends.
 
**Basic procedure:**
 
Navigating the glacier requires 3 successful skill checks before 2 failures. Default can be survival, but if they try something fancier that works too. With each check, get closer but glacier responses.
 
At end, if 3 successes, get through in reasonable time and speed, no penalty. With only 2 successes, takes a long time and require CON save vs exhaustion, but otherwise fine. With 1 success, same as 2 but also add 1 to tracker, and come out at night. With no successes, auto take 1 level of exhaustion and add 2 to the tracker as they get lost for more than a day.

## Guardians
 
_As you crest the final ridge of the ice shelf of the glacier, you see ahead of you, tall and silver and windowless, the tower of Airon Mistspeaker, floating in the air above the mountain, seemingly held aloft by clouds and wind and nothing more. The air is calm here, still and almost warm, as the howling winds seem not to touch the tower._
 
_A bridge of ice and stone arcs off the side of the mountain, reaching about 100' to a large dark door into the tower. A icy statue of a large human with a axe glinting in the dim light, flanked by two small fox statues, stands at the entrance to the tower._
   

**Ice guardian holds up its hand, motioning you to stop. There seem to be five small blue gems set into each finger. It seems to be trying to speak, but no sound comes out.**
 
**If they step off the bridge, it will attack.**
 
**When the ice guardian falls, describe small bluish gems crackling with lightning falling to the ground from his fist.**
