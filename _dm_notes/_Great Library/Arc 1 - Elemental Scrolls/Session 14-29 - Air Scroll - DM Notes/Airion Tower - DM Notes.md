## Overview

Basic overview of tower:

Many years ago, Airion traveled in his floating tower, studying the ways of elementals. The elemental scrolls he constructed contained secrets of binding and power, and he used those to power flying towers and other wonders.

After his death, rumors of the power of these scrolls tempted knowledge hunters to search for his tower (the location of the other scrolls was lost). One warlock in particular, a servant of a great elder elemental from the plane of air, sought the tower in order to reclaim the scroll for his master. This warlock was defeated and contained by Airion's final trap, a magic circle triggered by picking up the scroll, from which exit is impossible. The warlock died, but the power of his commitment to his patron was such that he as remained a deathlock mastermind, trapped but also guarding the scroll.

The rest of the tower is a mix of the following:

1. Traps and constructs from Airion's days
2. Elementals from the elemental plane of air or adjacent planes

## Door
 
The entryway to Arion's Tower is a magical lock.
 
_The door itself stands 10 feet tall, and is made of a single smooth piece of marble, glinting with etched runes and designs. There seems to be no obvious way in which it opens._
 
_Down the center of the door, three elaborate runes are carved. In sockets rest a few small blue gems, crackling with electricity, similar to the ones that fell from the ice golem._
   

## First Floor

_As you push open the doors, you find yourself looking out over a beautiful sky. A narrow stone path leads to stone hexagon in the middle of the room; all around you, you can see the ground thousands of feet below, clouds racing across the sky below your feet, and the valleys and mountains looking like a model below. Looking up, the walls of the tower seem to blend in with clouds whirling around you, in a funnel. High above you, a storm cloud rests, seemingly blocking the ceiling._
 
This is all an illusion, hiding an invisible stairway up.
 
The solution is just to walk around until they find the staircase. If they are really stuck, let someone with a high passive perception notice that the cloud patterns keep repeating when they are looking below.
 
## Second Floor
 
_The stairway emerges into a small entryway. Two walls slope out from the walls, meeting in a broad archway, through which you can see a library or study. On either side of the archway stand two suits of plate armor, one holding a longsword and a shield, the other holding a large battleaxe. To the left, you see a opening in the ceiling, but no obvious way to ascend._
 
If the party tries to approach the archway, the suits of armor will lower their weapons, blocking entry to the archway. If anyone gets in and they notice, they will attack, but they will not initiate combat with anyone who remains outside the library.
 
If the animated armor is destroyed, one suit of wearable armor can be salvaged from the pair, which is a suit of Adamantine Armor (plate mail).
 
The library itself contains a number of interesting books and scrolls, and is a safe place for a short rest.
 
_The library itself seems to be largely untouched. A desk faces the wall, above which a window looks out into a swirling, endless sky. Next to it, a small chest with silver clasps sits on the floor. Stretching out from the walls are four large bookshelves, although few books remain. A number of chains and bindings hang from the shelves, perhaps formerly securing the missing tomes._
 
Things that can be found in the library:  
The chest is locked, and requires a DC 15 thieves' tools check to pick. The metal is charged, and a failed roll does 2d6 lightning damage. After the first try, can try again without taking damage. Smashing chest is possible but will likely destroy the vials. The chest contains:
 
1 scroll of lightning bolt  
4 vials of silver ink  
1 pearl worth 50 gp  
1 diamond worth 300 gp  
A small multicolored feather (Bird Feather Token)
 
The books are…
 
1. A Sky of Dusk: a collection of Stoneborn stories, with translated (Chardonian) and original text [Aglath]
2. Codex of Lightning: a treatise on drawing energy from the plane of air; too complex to understand for anyone without 5th level spell slots. Written in Chardonian. [Adrik]
3. Arcane Elementals: an ancient book, written in Drankorian, devoted to the study and control of elemental beings [Samso]
4. Librum Ithras: the private notebook of a mage and scholar of the late Drankorian empire, written in Drankorian and also in cypher text; valuable [Samso, given to Great Library]
5. On the Nature of Djinni: a book describing djinni, their society, and their powers, mostly wrong, and corrected by Airion with silver ink markings. Written in Chardonian. [Samso]
6. The Lay of Estar: a long Elven poem about Estar, friend of wanderers, and one of the first elves to discover, explore, and name the elemental planes (name = person who names things), in the distant past. [Aelar took]  
To get to the next floor, there is a wind step. Underneath the opening in the ceiling, there is a levitation field that sweeps anyone under the hole up to the next level.
 
## Third Floor
 
_As you ascend to the next floor, you emerge into what looks like the ruins of an alchemical laboratory, with only a single table in the middle still standing. A shattered bench with glassware scattered about looks as if it has been struck by lightning. Pieces of glass and metal are spread over the floor, everywhere except the far wall, where a muscular, blue-skinned man, about 9 feet tall, wearing the tattered remains of a white vest, hangs by two iron chains, along which occasional pulses of energy run._
 
_As you enter the room, he looks up, cold blue eyes staring at you. "You fools. What pointless errand brings you to this godforsaken place?"_
 
This djinni, Mehrangeesa of Sumana, was originally captured and enslaved many years ago by Airion the Mistspeaker. Airion drew upon his magic to learn of the Plane of Air and power his tower, among other things, but upon his death Mehrangeesa remained bound by the enchantments in the tower. Some years after, when the warlock Zadkai ventured into the tower to attempt to retrieve the scroll, his master, an elder elemental of the plane of Air who mistrusted the djinni of Sumana, feeling they were too free in cooperating with humans, forbid him from freeing Mehrangeesa, and indeed reveled in his suffering.
 
Now, there is a standoff. The scroll can only be removed from its circle of protection by a humanoid, and thus neither the deathlock Zadkai or the air elemental servants of his patron can act. Mehrangeesa simply wants to be free and home, and ultimately wants to break the power of wizards to enslave elementals; he does not care about the scroll or Zadkai anymore, but can warn the party a bit. Zadkai, on the other hand, wants the scroll destroyed, or at least returned to its rightful owners on the plane of elemental air.
 
If Mehrangeesa is freed, he will be grateful but impatient. He will close the portal to the air plane in Zadkai's lair, making the final battle easier (cutting off Zadkai's chance of escape). He will also warn the party against those who would misuse the power of elementals, telling them that he will know if the party aids in these endeavors.
 
As a reward, he will offer to sketch an _Eldritch Claw t_attoo on one character (perhaps slightly modified, tuning down damage or changing type).
 
Freeing the genie requires two things:
 
First, in the wall next to the chains are runes like on the door: four starbust runes generating energy that reaches the manacles. There are four gem sockets, all empty. If they go retrieve the gems and fill the sockets, the manacle energy will shut down.
 
Then, they need to break the iron chains, or pick the locks. Smashing them is loud. Each chain has 20 hit points, AC 12, damage threshold of 10, and is immune to most damage except bludgeoning, thunder, force. If it takes more than 3 turns to break, a living lightning bolt will start appearing, one every turn until the noise stops. Djinni can use whirlwind attack.
 
Alternatively, can pick lock, DC 16. Need to do twice, same rules as breaking.
 
## Fourth Floor
 
The fourth floor is largely given over to living quarters: a bedroom, and small hall/kitchen. The bedroom is very spare, with little in it. Under the bed (DC 12 to find) is a small chest, which contains 220 gp, 1780 sp, and 2500 cp in old coins, what is left of Airion's personal funds. There is also a small purse with 10 cut gems of various types, each worth 25 gp.
 
The bedroom has two small notebooks that contain cryptic scribblings from Airion's life. These are written in cypher, requiring a DC 18 Intelligence check to decipher, and 1 hour of time.
 
The hall/kitchen contains an _Alchemy Jug._
 
[Stairs: in a separate little tunnel up, when you get to the 3rd to last step both doors shut, a lever appears, and a 30 second countdown occurs. After countdown, doors open. If you pull the lever, the timer resets. Can keep going forever until decide to wait]
 
## Fifth Floor

[if djinni is freed, no rumble of thunder, delete portal]
 
_As you climb the stairs to the final floor of the tower, you can hear above you a low hum._
 
_The room at the top of the stairs is a bare, empty space, except for an old man sitting in a rickety wooden chair in the middle of the room, a small chest open next to him. He holds a staff, glowing with light, and wears dark blue robes. Faint runes glow on the walls, casting a dim glow around the room._
 
_The man stands as you enter, leaning heavily on his staff. "Ah…! Welcome, strangers, to my tower. I have been waiting a long time for visitors." His voice is raspy, as if he has not spoken in a long time._
 
Zadkai, using disguise self to seem to be an old man, is pretending to be Airion. He was killed by the trap that was set off when the chest was opened, and now cannot lift the scroll out of the chest. His goal is to get one of the party to lift the scroll out of the chest, and ideally hand it to him. If that happens, immediately cast darkness, then run towards the portal. If he gets through, there is probably no stopping him. If the djinni was freed, he will instead immediately cast darkness and then dimension door down, trying to escape across the ice.
 
If he is pressured, he will change his disguise self to Zadkai in non-deathlock form, and try to spin lies about Mehrangeesa, playing up the "Airion was a bad dude who stole stuff from the air elementals, let me return it."
 
If that fails, will drop disguise self, turning into deathlock form, while saying something like "Fine, now you must die!".
 
Zadkai carries a Necklace of Fireballs, currently with 4 beads, which he will use in battle. He also has a Rod of the Pact Keeper +1 (this is his staff), two potions of greater healing (useless to him), a Ring of Obscuring, a Pearl of Power, and a potion of fire breath.
 
In the chest is:

- the air scroll
- a small blue sapphire. The sapphire is magical, and when affixed to a weapon that does not currently give any bonuses to attack, gives the weapon a +1 to attack and damage rolls.

## Resting in the Tower
 
The tower itself has defenses. After about an hour and a half or two hours at one location, the nearest wall or ceiling will begin to glow with a faint energy, and then get brighter and brighter. After about 30-60 minutes of getting brighter and brighter, if the party has not moved on, a living lightning bolt will emerge and attack.
