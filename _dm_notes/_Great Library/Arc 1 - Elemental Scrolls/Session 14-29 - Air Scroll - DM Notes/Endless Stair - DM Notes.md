*Map*

![[endless-stair-map.png]]

**Overview**
 
The stair climbs about 4000', which is about 12000 steps. Assuming about 2000 steps / hour, we are talking about 6+ hours to climb assuming rest breaks and normal pace. Have them make Con check to avoid exhaustion.
 
After 4000', come to an area where stairs have collapsed / exploded. Oozes and mold have infested this area and the actual endless stair has crumbled, but tunnels allow bypassing it.
 
Stair column continues straight up, but the stairs themselves have been destroyed / shattered for at least the range of darkvision (actually out to 70'), so it looks like a smooth tunnel going up. A hole has been blasted in the side of the stairwell, and there is a large circular cavern outside it.
 
**Explosion Area**
 
In the cavern, a layer of noxious gas covers the floor, about 10' above ground. When land in the cavern, make a DC 15 Con save. On success, no effect. On failure, cough and choke on the gas. Take 2d6 poison damage, and are considered poisoned while in the room. After leaving the room, poison lasts for 1 hour. The gas is also flammable - as soon as someone with a torch jumps down, it will explode. Everyone in the gas must make a DC 20 Dex save or take 3d6 fire damage. But the poison effect is now gone.
 
The gas is faintly colored - careful investigation from the top can reveal that the air below seems discolored and you catch a faint smell of sulfur. If using darkvision, roll with disadvantage on perception check.
 
In the ceiling directly above, there is a jagged hole. On the ceiling is a patch of brown mold (DMG p. 105). The temperature in the cave is noticeably cold, and anyone trying to climb into the crack will take cold damage as described.
 
**Crawl**
 
The jagged hole leads to a tunnel that seems to be angling upwards, parallel to the stairs. A long, muddy crawl, taking about an hour of struggling to get to another opening, generally heading up. But the tunnel is so tight and narrow that climbing is not so bad.
 
After this climb, come out into a larger chamber (natural cavern), maybe 40' in diameter. A large damp, oily slick on the floor.
 
One beefed up (extra HP) black pudding hangs here, with two gray oozes. Will drop on first character up, potentially surprising them. Rest of party will need to climb out one at a time to join battle.
 
On the far side of this cavern, the endless stair can be seen again, and the rubble cleared to get to it.
 
**Upper City**
 
After another 2500' ascent, the stairs emerge into the upper city, which, while partially destroyed, still has some impressive grandeur to it.
 
The stairs themselves emerge in a clear crystal building, walls faintly shimmering with light, in a small "courtyard". The ceiling is at least 60' high, probably higher, and you have a sense of space stretching into the distance.
 
Four towering archways lead to the north, south, east, and west.
 
**North Archway:**
 
This seems to be a major road or other well-traveled passageway. Remains of crystal wall sconces, the occasionally opening to the left or right, and the straight path, curving slightly upward. After 1/2 mile or so, opens into a large cavern. But a rockfall or collapse has destroyed most of the area, and all the exits are blocked. Far above, maybe 400', a small skylight allows sunlight in.
 
Climbing to the top requires 4 DC 15 Athletics checks. With climbing speed, requires no check, but area around skylight is icy, and requires a DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics check to avoid falling. On a failed check, can attempt a DC 12 Dex save to hang on.
 
The skylight is about 2' x 2' square, and looks out onto a snowy glacier.
 
**South Archway:**
 
Turns down rather quickly, continuing for a short distance before coming to another open area, with a large stone door. A passage to the west is blocked by rubble, but a passage to the east twists upward.
 
The stone door is the entrance to a library. A safe place to rest if doors can be secured.
 
The foyer / entryway has been stripped of valuables, but used to house a collection of precious relics. The pedestals where they used to rest are mostly still intact. An archway leads into the main room of the library / scriptorium / etc.
 
In the main room, part of the roof has collapsed and the corner is now a pile of rubble. Some shelves remain on the far side of the room, beyond a central sunken area. In the sunken area, the ruins of a forge remain. Investigation (Arcana DC 15 or History DC 18) will reveal this was used for rune crafting. The stone shelves have crumbled slightly, and have largely been looted, but a careful search can find some remaining treasure / clues:
 
1. DC 13 Investigation check: while no books have survived, fragments of rune stones have survived. Several pieces with Dwarven runes carved on them can be found. If anyone reads Dwarven, they can tell these are describing research into the properties of gemstones and the magical uses of gems. There are also several legends of Dwarven history, in fragments.
2. DC 16 Investigation check: hidden in a crack of stone is a fragment of red quartz. This is a secret Dwarven rune stone - when a light is shown on the crystal, runes will be projected. Make something up here if they find it.
3. DC 17 Investigation check: a silver ring. with a small embedded green emerald in the center of a star etched in silver. This is magical, requires attunement, and lets you cast Stoneskin once per day, without requiring material components (but still requiring concentration).
 
**East Archway:**
 
The passageway here leads straight for a short time, and then begins to ascend again, sloping upward. It passes through a guard room of sorts, some kind of entry chamber, and then into the exit room (**sword wraiths)**.
 
**West Archway:**
 
Leads to temple. Replace chalyte, instead locus of deathlocks power; dwarves here are cursed by archfiend deathlock's betrayal, cannot rest while deathlock is alive.
 
Temple 1st floor:
 
C: Main hall.  
Coming up the stairs to the large cast bronze doors. They are not locked, but are stuck. DC 15 Strength check to open. If success, opens, if failure, opens but loudly (chance to draw quaggoth patrol, who will not enter temple but will keep watch and attack either on roof or steps when they leave). The doors open into a huge hall, ceiling is at least 30' up, large intricate square pillars line the way to a central altar. Altar has a shield bearing a large rune etched in a purple gemstone on the front. Feel queasy and weak when entering, make CON save (see above).
 
Chalyte could be destroyed if they come up with something clever, but resists normal attacks completely. If destroyed, anyone in 20' takes 8d6 psychic damage (WIS save DC 16 for half) but chalyte effects gone and dwarf zombies collapse.
 
B: Tombs of the fallen soldiers.
 
This area is a tomb / area for reverence and giving praise to ancestors. The stone tiles are all carved with runes, and three small crypts and one large one line the walls. Lingering against the tombs are four gray looking dwarves, flesh starting to turn to dust and fall off their bones. As you enter they turn to stare and lurch towards you.
 
D: Private chapel, plus secret office of head priest (now deathlock).
 
Chapel is empty, but a careful search reveals some signs of door. Deathlock is cursed to carry out the same routine every day, so has worn a rut in the stone which is noticeable with a DC 14 Investigation or Perception.
 
There are also two vials of holy oil in here that are intact and good, despite being 500 years old. In addition, there is some silver religious artifacts and symbols.
 
The private study is behind a secret door, requires a DC 20 Investigation to notice, but if find the worn floor DC drops to 13 and can roll with advantage.
 
In the private study is a stone desk, a small shrine to the Runemaster, and a bookshelf. This is a safe place to rest if the deathlock is killed, no one else knows about the secret door (although chalyte effects not gone).
 
Searching the desk will reveal some private notes in Dwarvish. If they can read them, will reveal that the priest of this temple was actually a warlock, who had traded his loyalty to an archfiend patron and betrayed his kind, for power.
 
A: Temple forge
 
On the second floor of the temple is the temple forge, a sacred space for rune casting and crafting. This has been destroyed by an ancient explosion. Shards of metal are embedded in the walls, and the deathlock and two specters will come out. Some raw metal and uncut gems can be found scattered around, and possibly a forged runic item (pendant if they didn't find it in the library, otherwise something based on rune of clear mind perhaps?).
 
E: Collapsed. The ceiling of this room has fallen in, and the room is filled with rubble. If they have some way of digging through or clearing it, this was a storeroom, mostly for raw material and finished products related to the temple forge. Can improvise something.
 
**Roof of temple has opening to outside.**

**Brown Mold**  
==Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid.==  
==When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.==  
==Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals cold damage is instantlyÂ destroyed.==

**Basic history:**
 
This dwarven outpost was much bigger once, but a warlock betrayed them and fell. Sword wraiths are guards of temple who were slaughtered by magic and surprise; duergar / zombies are cursed followers of the deathlock.
