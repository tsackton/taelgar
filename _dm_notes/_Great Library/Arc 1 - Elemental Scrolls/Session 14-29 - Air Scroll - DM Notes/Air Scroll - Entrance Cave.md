**Overview:**
 
Entrance to the "Blacksilver Caves" is at the end of an old dwarven road. Large, carved stone figures stand outside what was once an enormous door, but that has now been smashed. Sheer cliffs loom above. Play up Dwarven architecture - Moria-esque.

**Rooms:**
 
**1: Entryway**
 
The entry hall has clearly carved steps going down. If they are being particularly quiet / no torches / etc, can potentially here sounds of arguing below. Also could notice if they search giant footsteps going in and out.
 
Near the crumbled doors is a refuse heap with mostly hobgoblin armor, a careful search reveals a few items of human clothing and some bones of animals, along with 421 gp, 1123 sp, and a javelin of lightning.
 
**2: Lair**
 
Two trolls have made this cave their lair. They are currently arguing over who gets to eat a scrawny mountain goat they butchered. When they notice party will be very happy for more meat.
 
Scattered about the lair is their sleeping quarters, fire pit, and other 'homey' stuff. They don't care much for treasure, more concerned with meat, so treasure is only found in refuse heap.
 
**3: Chimney**
 
A chimney goes up about 100' here, and provides a lair for 30 **stirges**. They regenerate, so can only be wiped out with fire or acid. If more than 15 die, the rest will flee.
 
Perception check (DC 13) to hear sounds.
 
**4: The Endless Stair**
 
The tunnel opens into a chamber made entirely of black obsidan. It shines and reflects any light, causing it to seem like there are endless mirrors. Ascending from the room is a spiral staircase, going up as far as you can see. Continue on 'The Endless Stair'
