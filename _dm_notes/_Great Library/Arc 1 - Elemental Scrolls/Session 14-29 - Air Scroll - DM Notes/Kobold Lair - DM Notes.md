**Map**

**General Information on Kobold Lair:**
 
Unless otherwise noted, all tunnels are 3-4' in height, roughly circular. A small creature can walk normally; a medium creature must crawl (and hence is considered prone). All tunnels are dark with no light; carrying a torch while crawling is difficult, but not impossible (although requires a free hand).
 
The kobold lair contains, in total:
 
52 regular kobolds  
14 kobold dragonshields  
7 kobold inventors  
7 kobold scale sorcerers
 
2 kobold war leaders (higher level homebrew) -\> dragonshield with bonus HP + AC  
2 kobold scale sorcerers (higher level homebrew) -\> scale sorcerer with bonus HP  
2 kobold acolytes (homebrew) -\> kobolds with bonus HP
 
1 kobold priest (homebrew): [https://imgur.com/mwDRqsM](https://imgur.com/mwDRqsM)  
1 kobold chief (higher level homebrew): [https://imgur.com/dXl87Vp](https://imgur.com/dXl87Vp)
 
The kobolds also have several other pets / creatures:
 
Giant Centipedes  
Darkmantle  
Choker  
Gelantaneous Cube and other oozes  
Swarms
 
**Random Encounters in Tunnels**
 
While traveling through the tunnels, choose or roll 1d6 to select an encounter:  
1: two swarms of rot grubs drop from ceiling on two random PCs  
2: three kobolds attack from behind  
3: a gelatinous cube approaches from front (1-3) or behind (4-6)  
4: two kobold scale sorcerers attack with scorching ray (subtle spell) then flee  
5: a group of chokers (one per PC) attacks from above  
6: two kobold inventors throw random inventions then flee
   

**Prisoner Exchange:**
 
-kobolds set up at entrance to cave; with the prisoner are 6 regular kobolds, 2 scale sorcerers, and a war leader; they will flee immediately if party attempts to attack  
-hidden in cliffs are another 12 kobolds, all with readied ranged attacks and ability to flee directly into tunnels
 
Kobolds will honor ransom exchange, but will not return the message/map, which they are hoping to give to Grumella to gain favor
 
Let the exchange play out. Kobold war leader is nervous and wants to be back in cave as soon as possible.
 
The messenger, Amus, is a young, brash man, shaken by the experience of being a hostage. However he is dedicated to the library and once exchange is made and he is ungagged will tell them that they need to get the map.
 
He can remember some details if they want to just go for it without facing kobolds, but this will make things more difficult (also increase chance of meeting orc party at air scroll location).
 
**Make it obvious when talking to Amus that the kobolds kept the maps, etc, to give to someone called Grumella**

**Rooms**
 
**1: Entry room**
 
The entryway is a natural cavern with 15' ceilings, and some dim light from the cave opening.
 
This room is well guarded to prevent anyone from entering the kobold lair complex: **6 kobold dragonshields, 2 kobold scale sorcerers**, and **1 kobold inventor** wait here.
 
On the ceiling in the middle of the room are 2 tame **darkmantles**, who will attack when given a signal by kobolds.
 
There is also a wooden contraption filled with oil on one side. Two kobolds will release this when they can get at least two PCs in the area -- has the effect of a grease spell, and is flammable (effect of the create bonfire cantrip).
 
The dragonshields will fight to the death, but the 8 kobolds and the scale sorcerers will try to flee, and especially try to lure the adventurers into the pit trap.
 
**2: Guard room**
 
This is also a major guard station. Another 4 **dragonscales**, 3 **sorcerers,** 6 **kobolds,** and 1 **kobold war leader** guard the entryway. Two kobolds are stationed to release 2 **swarms of poisonous insects**. Again, dragonscales will fight to death while regular kobolds try to flee.
 
Across the middle of the room is a false floor that will collapse if anyone heavier than a kobold steps on it. Below is rubble and mud; requires an action to climb out, otherwise are considered restrained.
 
**3: Mines**
 
This is a series of mine shafts and tunnels. Unless a tripwire alarm has been sounded, 10 **kobolds** and 2 **inventors** will be working here. If the alarm has been sounded, they will be hiding in tunnels and hard/impossible to flush out (improvise).
 
There are basic mining gear here; in addition, there are 1d4 silver ignots (worth 50 gp each) and 2d6 iron ignots (worth 5 gp each), that can be found with careful searching (no roll needed, just say they search).
 
**4: Kilns**
 
This is the crafting area: forges and basins for ironworks are set up here. Unless alarm has been sounded, 8 **kobolds** and 2 **inventors** will be working. If alarm has been sounded, workers will be hiding (improvise).
 
**5: Shrine**
 
This is a shrine to the **Kulkanok,** a ancient red dragon worshipped as a god by these kobolds. One **kobold priest**, two **kobold acolytes**, and 4 **kobolds** are here. The priests will fight to death. They can also release two **oozes**.
 
In center of room is a statue of a red dragon, which has been rigged by kobold priest to spray flaming oil from its mouth. As an action, the kobold priest can trigger this, which has the effect of a burning hands spell cast at 3rd level. This can only be done once, and then takes 5 minutes to refill oil.
 
There is a pile of offering below the statue, mostly red gems (8 gems, worth 10-50 gp each); [https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/treasure.html#gems](https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/treasure.html#gems). There are also a few trinkets, mostly small weapons and minor items not worth much, but mixed in is a small silver dagger engraved with dwarven runes (this is a +1 dagger).
 
The priest is wearing a circlet of blasting.
 
**6: Throne Room**
 
This is the main chamber of the clan king and his advisors. A crude silver-studded stone throne is set in one end of the chamber, and several stone tables and crude stone benches are scattered around the room. Part of the room is also clearly a sleeping chamber.
 
The **kobold chief**, 1 **war leader**, 2 **advanced sorcerers**, and 4 **dragonscales** are here. If the alarm has sounded, the dragonscales and sorcerers will be hiding, and the chief will attempt to intimidation / convince the party to surrender.
 
There are several barrels scattered about, which contain a magical blasting powder. A button on the throne triggers them. Anyone in 10' takes 2d6 fire and 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or half on a DC 12 Dex save.
 
If combat starts, the chief, his war leader, and the 6 kobolds will flee out the escape tunnel, leaving the dragonscales and sorcerers to hold down the route.
 
There is no treasure in this room (although with some work 100 gp of gems and silver can be recovered from the throne). However, a secret door (DC 13 active search to find, or DC 18 passive) leads to a treasure room. In this is the 500 gp ransom from the party, another 375 gp, 700 sp, and 1400 cp, the maps and notes from Amus, and five potions slated to be sent to Grumella: two _potions of greater healing,_ one _potion of fire resistance_, one _potion of climbing_, and one _potion of diminution_.
 
**7: Mushroom farm**
 
Pretty much all the surfaces in this room are covered in fungus or slime; this is where the kobolds grow the food they don't get from killing things. Tending the mushrooms are 5 **kobolds** and 1 **sorcerer.**
 
**8: Nursery**
 
This is the egg hatchery. Reptile eggs in sand pits are incubating. If enough warning has been given, room is empty. Otherwise, about a dozen eggs in various states of incubation, with 6 **kobold** attendants.
 
**9: Sleeping quarters**
 
Sleeping quarters. If alarm is given, will be empty. Otherwise, will contain 11 sleeping **kobolds**, 2 **scale sorcerers**, and 1 **inventor** (also sleeping). A few scattered copper pieces and other trinkets / personal possessions.
 
**10: Storage**
 
Food and water storage; empty.

Start two long rest tracking now (not counting long rest they just took).
