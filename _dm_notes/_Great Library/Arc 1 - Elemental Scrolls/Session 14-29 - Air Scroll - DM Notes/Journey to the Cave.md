**Overview:**
 
The air scroll is hidden in a floating castle above a glacier in the north of the [[Fiamatara mountains]]. The floating tower was the home of Arion the Mistspeaker, the location of which has been a mystery for many years to the library.
 
Recently, researchers in the archives have uncovered information suggesting the last location of Arion's tower was above a ruined dwarven mining complex known as the 'Blacksilver Caves.' Rumor has it that, while the tower itself is hidden in mists and storms, it can be reached by ascending the Endless Stair that goes through the heart of [[Blacksilver Peak]].
 
The exact location of Blacksilver Caves is detailed in the maps and journals the messenger was carrying. Without the maps, the messenger can remember a few clues:

1. It was in the far north of the [[Fiamatara Mountains]]
2. [[Blacksilver Peak]] was described as a 'sharp, snow and ice covered knife edge, source of perpetual storms, even in summer'
3. An ancient Dwarven road leads into the mountains from the plains and to the entrance to Blacksilver Caves
 
**Mechanics:**
 
The journey to the cave is a series of random encounters, divided by section. Some encounters provide clues to the cave or other aid; others are environmental perils, or hostile creatures. If they have a map, they can skip straight to the 'Dwarven Road' section, as the map details exactly how to find the Dwarven road.
 
Grumella's team is searching for air scroll as well. They start with a quest counter of 0, and there status depends on counter:  
\<2: still organizing, not at road yet, will not be encountered  
3: at Dwarven road, will be encountered after leaving castle on way back to Voltara  
4: found scroll, but will be encountered in castle  
5: found scroll, and escaped back to base; scroll is missing
 
Every **two long rests** also adds 1 to Grumella's quest counter.
 
**With the map:**
 
Uneventful and quick journey to dwarven road, then roll encounters there until find cave entrance. Assuming they go straight (instead of back to town), Grumella quest counter is unchanged.
 
**Without the map:**
 
1. If they go back to town: they can learn the rough location of [[Blacksilver Peak]] from people in Voltara. Skip "plains" encounters, go to mountains. Add 2 to Grumella quest counter
2. If they decide to just head north and see what they can find, start with "plains" encounters. Add 1 to Grumella quest counter
 
**Grumella's party:**
 
6 orcs, 1 orc blade of Ilneval, 1 orc claw of Luthic, 1 orc red fang of shargass
 
(if 4 or 5, 3 orcs and claw of Luthic are dead)
 
**CURRENT TRACKER LEVEL: 1**
 
**CURRENT LONG RESTS: 2**

**Plains (d10):**
 
**1-4: hostile encounters**  
**5-7: environmental encounters**  
**8-10: helpful encounters**
 
If succeed on a DC 15 Navigation check, add 1 to d10 roll
 
**1:** a pair of wyverns  
**2:** a pack of 4 manticores spying for hobgoblins  
**3:** a pair of hill giants (hunting for scraps)  
**4:** hobgoblin patrol (6 hobgoblins, 1 hobgoblin captain, 1 hobgoblin devastator)
 
**5:** long, boring day; reroll, add 1 to Grumella counter  
**6:** thunderstorm and flash flood: they've been following a dry stream bed, hear gurgling then rushing - what do you want to do; skill challenge, need 3 successes out of 5 tries to climb out, DC 14 on all checks. If fail, add 1 to Grumella counter as delay caused by recovering from flood  
**7:** chalyte area -- come to a place where grass is bare; dusty/dirty patch; this is a place where vein of chalyte runs close to surface. Never mined, but causes a reality distortion field. Feel like moving through molasses, make a DC 12 Con save (everyone). If fail, feels like moving through thick syrup, every step seems to throw sparks off the ground, roll on wild magic surge table for each person who fails. Add 1 to Grumella counter if this ends up delaying them somehow.
 
**8:** Recognize [[Blacksilver Peak]]; go to mountain table  
**9:** Recognize [[Blacksilver Peak]]; go to mountain table  
**10:** _Aneril_, a Elven woman and druid of the Circle of the Red Hawk; will question on purpose but assuming they are friendly, etc can point to mountain; go to mountain table

**Mountains (d10):**
 
**1-4: hostile encounters**  
**5-7: environmental encounters**  
**8-10: helpful encounters**
 
If succeed on a DC 15 Navigation check, add 1 to d10 roll
 
**(tweak these since Oskar is here)**
 
**1:** basilisk hunting party (3-4 basilisks)  
**2:** a wyvern lair (2) or a Remorhaz lair  
**3:** a lone frost giant + 1-2 winter wolves or a Young Remorhaz  
**4:** hobgoblin patrol (5 -7 iron shadows)
 
**5:** long, boring day: reroll, add 1 to Grumella counter  
**6:** rock slide (based on thunderstorm), on failure add 1 to Grumella counter  
**7:** choose either 5 or 6 depending on feeling
 
**8:** find signs of Dwarven road go to Dwarven road challenge  
**9:** find signs of Dwarven road go to Dwarven road challenge  
**10:** giant eagle eyrie- they can point to location of Dwarven road if convinced to help (will tend to be friendly); go to Dwarven Road table

**Dwarven Road (d4):**
 
If succeed on a DC 15 Navigation check, add 1 to roll
 
**1:** pick 1-3 from mountain encounters, or wyverns from plains encounters  
**2:** choose 1 or 3 depending on feeling  
**3:** improvise a cool bit of Dwarven history; if they explore can find some treasure but at cost of +1 to Grumella counter  
**4:** find cave

FOR NEXT SESSION
 
Current journey status:  
Currently just past noon, everyone at 1 hp, have not taken a short rest yet  
Will find [[Blacksilver Peak]] after another 3/4ths day of traveling.  
A pair of hunting wyverns drawn by the sounds of battle to scavenge for food and treasure
 
If they camp for afternoon/evening, leave early AM:  
---unless they take exceptional precautions, wyverns will see their camp and attack at night; a high enough perception roll (DC 18) will cause them to spot specks soaring above, too big to be birds  
----they will see [[Blacksilver Peak]] the next day in the mid-afternoon
 
If they move on this afternoon, after at most a short rest:  
----no wyvern attack  
----will find [[Blacksilver Peak]] mid-morning on the following day (assuming they camp at night), or will need to succeed on a DC 12 Perception or Survival check to notice it in the moonlight. Otherwise will miss it and not realize until a successful DC 14 Survival check
 
Once they find the peak: move on to mountain chart.
   

**CURRENT SESSION (6/6) NOTES:**
 
Dealt with thunderstorm / flash flood  
Fought frost giant and remorhaz  
Met giant eagle, failed to convince it to fly them across, but if they bring it two giant goats it will help them
 
When start next session, it is mid-afternoon and they are looking for giant goats
 
(aim should be for this to take the afternoon, fly across to road sleeping either before or after)  
(eagle will tell them a bit about the Dwarven road, and that the eagles don't go to the top, the storms are too violent and there are ice monsters there)
 
XP: 800 (add to sheets before next time); check spell slots and other stuff (Oskar should have all spells; Brelith cast a 3rd, a 2nd, and a 1st, plus used all charges; Samso cast a 2nd)
