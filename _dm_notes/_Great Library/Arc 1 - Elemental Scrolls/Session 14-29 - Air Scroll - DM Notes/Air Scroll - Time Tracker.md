**Mechanics:**
 
The journey to the cave is a series of random encounters, divided by section. Some encounters provide clues to the cave or other aid; others are environmental perils, or hostile creatures. If they have a map, they can skip straight to the 'Dwarven Road' section, as the map details exactly how to find the Dwarven road.
 
Grumella's team is searching for air scroll as well. They start with a quest counter of 0, and there status depends on counter:  
\<2: still organizing, not at road yet, will not be encountered  
3: at Dwarven road, will be encountered after leaving castle on way back to Voltara  
4: found scroll, but will be encountered in castle  
5: found scroll, and escaped back to base; scroll is missing
 
Every **two long rests** also adds 1 to Grumella's quest counter.
 
**With the map:**
 
Uneventful and quick journey to dwarven road, then roll encounters there until find cave entrance. Assuming they go straight (instead of back to town), Grumella quest counter is unchanged.
 
**Without the map:**
 
1. If they go back to town: they can learn the rough location of [[Blacksilver Peak]] from people in Voltara. Skip "plains" encounters, go to mountains. Add 2 to Grumella quest counter
2. If they decide to just head north and see what they can find, start with "plains" encounters. Add 1 to Grumella quest counter
 
**Grumella's party:**
 
6 orcs, 1 orc blade of Ilneval, 1 orc claw of Luthic, 1 orc red fang of shargass
 
(if 4 or 5, 3 orcs and claw of Luthic are dead)
