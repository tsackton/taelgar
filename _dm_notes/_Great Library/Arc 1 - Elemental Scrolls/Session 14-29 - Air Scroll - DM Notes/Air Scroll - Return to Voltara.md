Rerun [glacier](Ice%20Landscape.md). It is currently late afternoon, so seracs are main danger. Improvise a bit of if they roll poorly this should be tough.
 
After crossing the glacier, it is dusk. Run wolves encounter (4 dire wolves, 2 winter wolves). These are not normal wolves, much more malicious than usual. They will stealth/ambush if possible. If this goes very badly for them, Dinia can come to their rescue.
 
They can return to Dinia's hideout if they want; this is a safe place to rest, and an opportunity to roleplay. She will know a little of the history of the tower. If they ask, she can tell them a secret way off the mountain. They can also use the Roc feather if they'd like.
 
If they take endless stair, rerun any encounters they missed in there. The entryway can have been repopulated with specters and similar (don't use deathlock as a bit similar to Zadkai). Improvise something using same map as before.

**Session 29:**
 
- Orc resolution - interrogation, tracking one that got away, other decisions
- Getting back to Voltara - use the roc feather? To keep tension up, and since one got away, improvise a few random encounters as needed if they just proceed to walk, although none as difficult as the main war band
 
Used roc feather, summoned **Silver Feathers of the Storm Cloud, Thunder and Lightning**  
Rocs live far to the north, have long complicated names in their own tongue
 
In Voltara:

- Talk to Lyra at the Purple Pig, can hand over scroll, discuss
- Lyra then says she will return to Chardon with the scrolls but will be back in a few months
