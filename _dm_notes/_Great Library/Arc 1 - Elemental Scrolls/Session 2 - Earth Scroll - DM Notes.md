**The Crystal Chasm (location of the Stonemaster Scroll):**  
The Crystal Chasm is located in a small cave complex in a canyon across the grasslands. Orc bands roam the grasslands and hiding is difficult, so party’s best option is to move as fast as possible. Traveling at a slow pace will probably lead to an encounter with an orc scout or two.  
Once they get to the canyon, easier to hide although difficult terrain to move around. Discover trail of giant scouting party. Hopefully will be thinking stealth at this point.  
The entrance to the cave is easy to find and pretty obvious. As they enter the canyon:  
_The river here is flowing slowly, dry from lack of rain recently. Jumbled rocks and ragged cliffs make for difficult travel, but you slowly make your way towards the cave opening ahead._   
_(if passive perception \> 12): As you approach, you notice lots of tracks in this area. Many humanoids, and one or two very, very big ones. And the tracks of some animal like a bear?_  
Assuming they enter the cave opening:  
Entrance:  
_At the cave opening you see obvious signs of disturbance. Someone or something has been scouting in this area, it seems, and the tracks lead inside. (can determine they are orc tracks on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check, or Intelligence (Survival) check)._  
_As you enter the first large cavern, you see rubble piled up three feet high in several places throughout the cavern, and two tunnels lead out. The tunnel on the south wall is clear, but the tunnel to the east is chocked with debris. Dust still rides the zephyrs circulating through the cavern, leading you to believe the cave-in to the east was recent. In the dim light provided by the sunlight reaching from the entrance and several lanterns hung on the walls, you see two large orcs standing towards the center of the cavern, about 40 feet away. The largest, carrying a great axe, marked by a scar across one eye and a nasty snarl, booms out: “You have no business here. This is orc land. Leave now, or die!”_  
Combat: 2 orcs -- should not be too hard

![ORC Medium humanoid orc chaotic evil Armor Class 1...](Exported%20image%2020251029101733-0.png)

They will charge if players don’t immediately retreat. Will attack front line first, but if can get past front line will charge casters.   
After combat, the party can search the room and the orcs:  
After the adventurers have finished with the first battle, and after they have questioned any prisoners and searched the area, they can search the room. The only thing of note are the pair of giant-sized feet sticking out of the rubble in the hallway to the east. Obviously a hill giant fell victim to a trap. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that while the structural integrity of the tunnel was weak to begin with, it was sabotaged to act as a trap—one that that the giant obviously triggered.   
The orcs also carry a vial of alchemist’s fire each, although they will not use it in combat for fear of triggering more cave ins. Each orc also carries 1d12 cp and 1d6 sp.   
If they somehow get the orcs to talk ([http://themonstersknow.com/orc-tactics/](http://themonstersknow.com/orc-tactics/)), they will reveal that they are guarding the cave waiting for reinforcements to arrive to help sort out of the disaster of the cave exploration.   
South Tunnel  
_A scurrying sound and some high-pitched squeaking echo from the south tunnel. You look, expecting to see rats or some other vermin swarming toward you. Instead, you see an angry-looking swarm of orcs. These orcs, however, are no larger than mice. Their tiny axes seem almost comical at first, until you realize just how many of them there are. And then the lanterns all go out simultaneously._   
This swarm of cursed orcs was created by the shrinking magic trap that the remaining hill giant and their minions triggered in the next chamber. The lights are extinguished when tiny goblins snuck in and extinguished them, hoping that the distractions might confuse the adventurers. The swarm locks onto the nearest target and assaults it, trying its best to take it down before moving on to the next target. The swarm’s darkvision might give it an advantage for a round against adventurers with no special sight. 

![Swarms of Cursed Goblins Medium swarm of Tiny huma...](Exported%20image%2020251029101735-1.png)

These orcs are angry and motivated. They do not surrender, instead shrieking insults and profanities that are barely audible but heartfelt nonetheless. As the dozens of orcs in the swarm die and the swarm thins, the corpses of the orcs grow back to normal size, creating difficult terrain all over the place. The swarms can traverse this without penalty. After the orc swarm is defeated, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check made by a character examining the bodies reveals that the magic that caused the shrinking was a strong, but temporary, curse. Death causes the reduction in size to end.

Southern Cavern  
_This cavern, like the last, is lit with lanterns throughout. To the east, the cavern opens up to a large room, with a giant chasm like a massive crack in the ground running north to south, glinting and sparkling with reflected light from the lanterns. To the north, at the far end of the corridor, you can see a small creature dressed in ratty furs, wielding a club. He stands in front of a stone chest, with his back is to you, and you catch the sound of angry rumbling coming from his direction, but it is too faint to hear clearly. Then a yappy growl to your left alerts the creature, and it turns. It has the countenance of a terrible hill giant, but the stature of a goblin. It shrieks with fury: “Slayermighty the Giant will tear you apart and feed you to the Blooddrinker!” He charges towards you._  
The hill giant’s pet black bear, now about half the size of a bear cub, waits in the niche to the west of the entryway, and it smells the adventurers once they enter. She growls a warning to its master, but she is too small to pose a threat to the adventurers in her current condition, so she hides. She wears a small collar that says “Blooddrinker” in Giant.

![Cursed Hill Giant Small giant lawful evil Armor Cl...](Exported%20image%2020251029101737-3.png)

The cursed hill giant, a brute calling himself Slayermighty, charges the adventurers as soon as he knows they are present. His war cries about tearing the heads of the adventurers and drinking their blood might seem slightly ironic in his current condition, but his club still packs a wallop. Slayermighty, livid at his current predicament, fights to the death. His bear, Blooddrinker, is cursed as well and is currently too small to pose a significant threat to the adventurers. Slayermighty screams as he attacks about ruling all of giant-kind as soon as he slays the adventurers and regains his stature.   
Slayermighter carries a necklace of copper charms worth 200 gp, and two potions of healing, which he is too angry and confused to use.   
As they approach the chest:  
_The stone chest is carved directly into the floor of the chamber. A heavy stone lid, rests against the wall next to the chest. Runes are carved into the chest, the lid, and the floor in front of the chest. Inside, the chest is empty._  
A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that these runes are part of a magical curse that causes the victim to shrink in size and stature. These creatures have obviously fallen victim to the curse.   
Blooddrinker the Bear  
Slayermighty’s pet black bear also fell victim to the curse, and for her the effect is permanent. After Slayermighty is defeated, the bear calms and remains still. When the curse wears off, the bear starts to convulse and die. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) or DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check is needed to save her, and she dies in 2 rounds unless rescued. Magical healing alone is insufficient. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Handle Animal) check, an adventurer earns the loyalty of the bear. Now about the size of a housecat, Blooddrinker follows the character around learning tricks, and generally being adorably ferocious. She cannot attack or defend herself, being too small and traumatized from the curse, but she is something that others might see as interesting and novel. Only one check per adventurer is allowed. If more than one character would like to tame the bear and succeeds on the Wisdom (Handle Animal) check, Blooddrinker follows the character with the highest result. Whomever she takes a liking to earns the Blooddrinker the Bear story award.   
Crystal Rift  
As they approach the rift:  
_As you approach the chasm in the floor, you can see that the edge is lined with glimmering crystals of quartz in different colors, reflecting the light. The chasm descends into darkness below, stretching beyond the reach of your light or darkvision._   
The chasm is 70’ deep. Tying two ropes together can work, of course. They can attempt to   
When they enter the cavern, assuming they have light:  
_As you descend into the crystal chasm, you enter a wide hallway leading about forty feet to a large stone pillar covered in runes. The hallway is rough-hewn, but clearly intentionally caved. Several piles of rubble dot the path._   
****skipped mephits for time*****  
Assuming they walk towards the stone pillar, three stone mephits (reskinned mud mephits) animate and attack when they are within 20’ of the first one (about half way down corridor). They are drawn by the earth elemental and looking for victims, but won’t fight to death if they are seriously outmatched. Ceilings are not high enough for easy use of flight in melee, but if they need to escape will fly up the chasm.

The Rune Pillar  
_As you approach the pillar, the hallway opens up into a circular room, with a ceiling extending into darkness above. A loud rumbling sound echos through the cavern, a noise of gears grinding and stone being crushed. The pillar begins to move, and grow, and a huge stone humanoid emerges, towering above you, made of granite. It is all hard edges and hard stone, with fists the bigger than your head. You see runes dancing along its body as it moves, occasionally flashing black. Behind the creature, on a remanent of the pillar, sits a black obsidian tube with the edge of a scroll peaking out._   
_The creature booms in a loud, echoing voice. “What is your business here, travelers?”_  
Guardian set to protect the scroll from falling into the wrong hands.   
Players can attempt a variety of choices:  
-try to deceive guardian into thinking they are representatives of Arion  
-try persuasion (could be argued via intelligence or charisma)  
-intimidation would be very hard  
-try offering something in trade (also not likely to succeed although the argument that if they turn over the scroll to the party’s safekeeping the elemental can go free would be very persuasive).   
If they try to fight the elemental, they’ll be killed rather quickly. Warn them this is a bad idea (use size, etc as clues as well).  
They could also just leave and tell Lyra they found where it is but couldn’t recover it. She’ll be disappointed but not surprised.
