Four story beats for the next arc:
 
1. Travel to the mountains. This is the first long journey they'll have gone on, should aim for 2-3 sessions. Don't want to make it too boring with just random combat encounters each day, so instead organize it as stretches of safety and stretches of danger which they can fight through or avoid. Total distance is about 560 miles as the crow flies.
    1. Zone 1 (90 miles): Voltara hinterlands. Narrative, happy crowds and farmers cheering them on, etc, until they cross the river
    2. Zone 2 (150 miles): crossing the plains along the Chardon border. Pass occasional forts, perhaps some orc attacks angry and seeking vengeance. Might have a one-session short adventure tied to a fort in trouble? Not super-dangerous though.
    3. Zone 3 (150 miles): the open woods and fields of the foothills of the \<CentralMountains\>. Pass through at least one if not two zones of danger here, beyond the borders of Chardon things are more unsettled and the woods are weird and magical?
    4. Zone 4 (110 miles): foothills to the Dwarven halls; some danger until they meet dwarf patrols
2. The Dwarven kingdom. Probably at most 1/2 a session, either combined with the end of the travel to the mountains, or with the travel south
    1. Meeting Brelith's parents, Brelith's home, some time to explore etc, but learn of trouble to the south, the refugee crisis, etc
3. Travel south, maybe 1/2 session? Should start to get some clues about what danger is ahead.
    1. About 120 miles through the dwarven tunnels and mountains.
    2. Encounter abandoned frozen dwarven city
    3. Stoneborn village with stoneborn NPC who will accompany them
4. The Hag's Lair. Probably 3-4 sessions depending on how they approach it. Use a piece of Rime of the Frost maiden, heavily modified of course.
 
So, overall plan / design needs:
 
1. Travel details for five zones: four to mountains, and then journey south, including names for features, "danger zones" with possible encounters or ways to avoid, and role playing encounters
2. An optional border fort adventure
3. Brelith's hometown and the Dwarven kingdom
4. The hag's lair
