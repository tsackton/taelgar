A spider queen has been driven south by the black dragon in the northern fens and has made a lair in the northern part of the Northerner's territory, reaching south still for prey, food, territory.
 
Two ways they can encounter this: if talk to northerners, they will ask them for help dealing with this. If they avoid northerners, then chance they'll stumble on ambush with webs and either fight and move on or investigate.
 
Encounters / terrain:
 
Denser woods, darker, spooky.
 
Can encounter:
 
1. spider ambush (spiders + ettercaps) with a pit trap
2. a web trap (DC 15 Dex save to avoid being restrained by web and pulled upside down. Those in web are swarmed by little spiders, 1d4 damage plus DC 11 Con save every round or 1d6 poison damage plus poisoned, if fail check while poisoned fall unconscious until poisoned condition is cured, can escape web either by dealing 15 points fire/slashing damage, or succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check to break; take 2d6 falling damage after either), 1d4 hours after a spider ambush shows up. Samso will spot if in the lead.
 
Deeper into woods, webs everywhere, difficult terrain, hard to move, and frequent spider swarms (same rules as above but destroy in one round, basically just trigger random traps). Samso should notice insects everywhere but hard to guess which will swarm.
 
Can run random spider ambush also, if needed.
 
In "lair" area, two main encounters:
 
1. Nursery, which is just a boatload of giant spiders and spider swarms. **REMEMBER TO ADD POISON DAMAGE TO SWARMS**
2. Lair, which is a cave with the boss spider queen in it. Possibly some giant spiders will enter if needed, but feel like the boss is pretty nasty with lair actions and web.
 
Treasure:
 
Can find the dead bodies of many northerners, desiccated corpses eaten away. Some piles of loot discarded, but not much.
 
A dozen colorful round shields [_4 gp each_] are scattered around the lair. The light wooden shields are painted in a rainbow of brilliant colors, including leaf green, fiery red and vibrant blue and gold. Floral designs, triangles, and forest designs all can be seen on the shields.
 
An overstuffed leather sack [_1 gp_] containing several hundred copper coins [_932 cp_]
 
An iron and leather helm topped with a magenta horsetail, reinforced at the back by a short apron of chainmail which protects the shoulders and neck [_9 gp_]. Inside the helm, you find a secret pocket just under the crest that holds a multifaceted, well-cut jet the size of a ladybug [_30 gp_].
 
Four short swords [_8 gp each_] of standard ‘infantry’ make, completely free from ornamen- tation, have been tossed into the cauldron, as have a half dozen iron-tipped shortspears [_1 gp each_] of similarly plain design. A pile of more than 20 simple cloth tunics, all of which are peasant shirts in varying shades of brown and crimson, are scattered around the ground [_5 cp each_]. Lying loose are a few slivers of blue and purple lapis lazuli [_6 pieces, 4 gp each_] and the contents of a leather bag [_1 gp_] which has come open and spilled its silver and copper coins [_70 sp, 600 cp_].
 
A heavy woolen cloak [_14 gp_], dyed dark blue, lies crumpled in a corner. Lighter blue ink has been used to trace wandering spiral patterns on the cloak, and the fine garment's edges have been trimmed in bone-white thread and feathers. A silver clasp in the shape of an elk is used to secure the cloak [_36 gp_].
 
A small silver ring mounted with four gleaming black stones [_obsidian; 40 gp_].
