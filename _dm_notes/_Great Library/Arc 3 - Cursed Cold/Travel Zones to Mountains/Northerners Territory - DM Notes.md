Play like Germanic tribes -- hidden villages in the woods, secret paths.
 
Worried about military buildup on their borders. Have already suffered much in the past generations and just starting to rebuild. Speak Common, also a northern tongue.
 
If need religion: focus of religious life is the tanshi, the small gods, basically spirits of the tribe, hidden in sacred places on the landscape, who bring messages to the incorporeal gods. Basically a version of the Kestavo but with a more nebulous sense of the divine beings the small gods bring messages to.
 
Possible Tanshi names:

Want: some assurance that Chardon won't attack them and expand beyond the river. Help with the spiders. Worried about something dangerous in the north, rumors of trouble, of creatures fleeing. Want information about the troop buildup in Chardon border, is this a prelude to attack in the spring?
 
Can provide: safe passage through the woods, avoiding haunted ruins and dangerous traps. Food and shelter. Maybe some trade goods / gems / fur?
