## Intro
 
On the Alimas there is a bridge and small fort nestled into the light forest.
 
Laid out in a square with a wooden outer wall, row of tents inside, plus a few buildings: a temple, a mess, a commander's hall.
 
Will be invited to stay the night if they like.
 
Warned that there has been orc activity to the east, the remnants of Grumella's army, disorganized and raiding.
 
About a week ago, a high ranking officer traveling east went missing. Reward for news, here or at the garrison camp 80 miles east. Maybe orcs?
 
Commander Vidua
 
Captain Arros
