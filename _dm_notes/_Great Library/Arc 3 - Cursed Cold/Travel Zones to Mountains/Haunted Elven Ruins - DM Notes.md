Feels haunted, play up description, improvise.
 
A banshee or two lurks here, and there is no treasure to find beyond some small gems and old coins, and a child's set of silverware, ancient, decorated with a design that looks like flowing leaves. Takes a high Perception roll (at least DC 20) to find anything, and also lots of time, during which banshee(s) will investigate. Increase range of wail to 300 feet.
 
Random stuff from shadowfell may lurk here? If they enter and spend a long time in ruins, perhaps a shadow hunter will find them.
