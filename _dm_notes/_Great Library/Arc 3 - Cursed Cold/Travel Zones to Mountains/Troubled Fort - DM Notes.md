Fort on the river; architecturally very similar to first fort.
 
Older, though, been here 30-40 years, and has an established garrison town around the fort. Historically has been concerned with Northerner raiders, but rumors of orcs to the west now consume concerns.
 
Rumor of cattle going missing, garrison commander asks if they have time to investigate.
 
Commander is General Soria Caronius, a middle aged woman, heavily armored, tough, chip on her shoulder, but also overwhelmed to an extent, all aid has been flowing towards Voltara and those of us struggling out in the wilderness forgotten.
 
This leads to quest -- bullywugs + froghemoth
 
If they don't investigate, threat will grow stronger and become more of a menace and the plot will come back. But don't press it now.

Warn them when leaving -- the woods and forests between here and the mountains are not safe. Maybe for an army of dwarves, yes. But be careful. The people who live there are not friendly to Chardonians, and survive by raiding and stealing. And there are rumors of darker, haunted things in the deep parts of the forest. Stay away from ruins!
 
**NOTE: the party did not investigate, indeed skipped the fort entirely, so this plot line should come back at some point**
