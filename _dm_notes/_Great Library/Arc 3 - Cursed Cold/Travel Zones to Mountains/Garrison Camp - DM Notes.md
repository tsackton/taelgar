In the middle of the plains, a temporary fort, more like a camp. Recently established by one of the legions from the south.
 
Tents and a fortification but no permanent buildings, brick ovens and the like for making bread, etc.
 
Again, can spend the night.
 
Can get orc reward here as well (50 gp plus perhaps supplies if they ask - a few healing potions for example).
 
Bustle of activity, this is a new fort and the soldiers are eager to get it finished and fortified before winter. Recent shift -- most of troops along river, raids from the Northerners across the river, but now orc menace forced us to look to protect the northern border.
 
Camp is led by Commander Selva, an old veteran woman.
 
Will give 50 gp plus 2 healing potions for news of orcs; will ask if they followed to their camp, are they based around here? If no, they didn't, no further reward. If yes, and camp was destroyed, will give 1 greater healing potion as well.
 
If the party brings back stuff, as well, will pay the value of the stuff, plus an extra 25 gp reward for the news of Captain Arros' fate.
