One day traveling between fort and garrison camp, will be attacked by orcs. Two encounters, one afternoon, one evening at camp.
 
**Orc Band:**  
26 orcs  
3 fangs  
1 hand of thark  
1 priest  
1 commander
 
Fled the battlefield when Grumella fell, hid out to rest/recuperate for a few days, and are now raiding as best they can in the plains. Too small a group to threaten fort and have not been willing to cross the river, so pickings are slim and they are desperate. Will fight to the death and see party as their best hope for treasure and food.
 
Afternoon encounter:  
18 orcs  
1 blade (commander)  
1 priest
 
Night encounter:  
7 orcs  
3 fangs  
1 hand
 
**Treasure:**
 
The orcs don't carry treasure, and were starving and struggling. But, they can track the band back to their base if they want, which is little more than crude tents constructed with animals skins and wood.
 
Here, a careful search will uncover:
 
You find a military saddle made of black and burgundy  
leather [25 gp], along with a set of saddlebags  
[4 gp]. One is empty save for a scattering of  
coins [35 sp, 150 cp], while the other holds several  
bars of silver, each the size of a halflingâ€™s finger  
[17 bars, worth 1 gp each].
 
A heavy woolen cloak [14 gp], dyed dark blue,  
lies crumpled in a corner. Lighter blue ink has  
been used to trace wandering spiral patterns on  
the cloak, and the fine garment's edges have  
been trimmed in bone-white thread and feathers.  
A silver clasp in the shape of a walrus is used  
to secure the cloak [36 gp]. [Total 50 gp]
 
In a faded velvet pouch [5 sp], you find half a  
dozen tiny, irregular pearls, each about half the  
size of a pea [freshwater pearls, 6 gp each], mixed  
in with a handful of coins [7 gp, 20 sp].
 
You find three small sacks [5 cp each], each of  
which is full of coins. Two of them contain ordinary  
gold and silver pieces [15 gp, 70 sp total],  
while the third holds copper coins minted in  
ages past. These coins are quite tarnished, and  
feature a wide range of unusual designs [worth 28  
gp to a collector]. [Total 50.15 gp]
 
If they bring the cloak and saddle back to the border fort, it will be recognized as belonging to \<NAME\>, a high ranking officer who went missing a week ago. A reward of 50 gp will be given, in addition to the value of the gear. Additional 50 gp for dealing with orc menace.
