## Zone 1
 
Distance: 100 miles  
Travel conditions: safe, cart tracks, outskirts of civilization  
Time: 4 days at fast pace, 5 at normal, 6 at slow
 
Description:
 
_You begin your journey heading southeast on the main trade road, before turning east across the plains on a rough cart track._
 
Cheering farmers at first, then cut across plains on a rough cart track. Uneventful, if cold, first few days.
 
This area is the Voltaran hinterlands, farming and sheep herding, some small villages and the like, especially along road south.
 
Once they turn east, more 'frontier.' There is settlement, of course, but more small clusters of shepherds. Little trade to the east, and little settlement beyond the river. The river is not reliably navigable north of branch to centaur's lake, so trade passes south on the road.
 
Crossing the Alimas river is the transition to Zone 2.
 
## Zone 2
 
Distance: 150 miles  
Travel conditions: mostly safe, but some periods of danger  
Time: 5 days at fast pace, 6 at normal, 8 at slow
 
Description:  
Crossing the plains along the Chardon border. Open landscape, cold winds, some trees along river but once pass out of forests winter is here.
 
Small hunting/trapping settlement near the river fort, but otherwise this is unsettled land, garrisoned just by a temporary solider camp until the next river, where a permanent fort is established, which has a small settlement around it. The west branch of the river is navigable in stretches, and there is a bit more settlement along the border here.
 
This is a frontier, a place where Chardon is moving in, encroaching on low density Northros populations that survived the hobgoblin wars hiding in the forest to the east, these are Dania's people. Few settlements here, just garrisons and forts, particularly along the river.
 
The "troubled fort" is a major defensive fortification, with a bit of a garrison town associated. Along the Nahadi river.

## Zone 3
 
## (150 miles)
 
The open woods and fields of the foothills of the \<CentralMountains\>. Crossing beyond borders of the Chardonian Empire. Scattered woods, pines, fall taking over, most leaves dropped but some late trees holding on to golden and red leaves. More trees than seen for a while, the land wetter and wilder than the plains of Voltara.
 
If they are paying attention, should soon notice signs of people following them. Will be an ambush but won't attack immediately, will demand to know what they are doing. If peaceful offer to lead them back to village, talk.

Should be a way, if they do well with northerners, for them to get a map and have a route to avoid the spider woods.
 
The something else should be a weird ruin (maybe a destroyed elven city?) and something dangerous but not necessarily hostile that is also a fight they can avoid.
 
Goal of Zone 3 should be to feel different from the terrain they've been traveling through, see different monsters and creatures, but not necessarily fight a lot.
 
## Zone 4
 
(110 miles)
 
Foothills to the Dwarven halls; some danger until they meet dwarf patrols. Should go by quickly, just narrate as they leave the forests behind and reach the foothills of the mountains. If I do run a random encounter it should be easy stuff, maybe an owlbear or two just trying to get on with its life, or something like that.
