Basic overview:  
-have to investigate, can find clues:  
--slaughtered animals dragged to the river and disappeared  
--frog footprints leading to river  
--wooden arrows  
--a cowhand ran to investigate noise of cattle in panic and there was a foul stench, like rotting stagnant water  
--loud, resonating croak late one night, in the morning cowhand dead of poison and cows missing
 
Should point to traveling upriver
 
Can ask commander, who will say there is a peat bog about a day's travel up the river but otherwise not much (double check this with map)
 
If travel upriver in boats/canoes, ambush at edge of swamp
 
Bullywug settlement small, such as it is -- a few run down huts and the like. Fattening up froghemoth for night raid on fort to get treasure and food for winter. Hence stealing cows.
 
Four encounters:  
-guards  / great snapping turtles
-"town"  
-turtle pit  
-froghemoth worship
 
Most of the swamp has pools of water, etc, making terrain difficult. But guard encounter should be fairly easy?
 
Mechanic for alertness if they fail to kill guards quickly?

**Notes**
Dragon drove them south
Food scarce - orcs
Raiding humans to survive
