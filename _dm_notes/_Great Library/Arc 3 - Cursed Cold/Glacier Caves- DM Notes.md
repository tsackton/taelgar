\> [!caution] This page contained a drawing which was not converted.   

First excavated by frost giants to build a temple to the ice shard, to protect and control it. Areas 1-8 are originally frost giant in origin.
 
Later, added to by Morgana for her own purposes. Areas 9-15 are Morgana-created.
 
The entire area counts as extreme cold.  
**Extreme Cold**  
==Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of== **exhaustion**==. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.==  
In addition, resting is difficult. The chill in the air makes sleep hard to come by and even with warm weather gear it can be hard to get a rest.
 
To take a short rest, the party needs to get a fire going and set up a sheltered camp; DC 15 Survival check, on pass short rest takes normal time, otherwise 2 hours.
 
To get a long rest is tougher. Everyone attempting to sleep must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If they have a nice camp (DC 15 or better survival) these saving throws are made with advantage. On a failure, recover spell slots and class resources but no HP from resting and only 1/4 level hit dice. On a failure \> 5, also gain one level of exhaustion.
 
## Frost Giant Tunnels

The frost giants shaped tunnels and gardens under the ice. Everything in this area has corridors 10-15 feet wide and 20 feet tall, with doors sized for giants. There are brackets for torches, although these are not now lit unless otherwise indicated.
 
The tunnel winds maybe 100' into the glacier before opening into the entrance cave.
 
**1: Entrance Cave**
 
Two enormous, life-sized ice statues of frost giants loom out of the walls on either side of this entrance chamber. Both hold the shattered hilts of greatswords carved of ice.
 
Once this was a defense and a trap, to prevent non-frost-giants from entering, but Morgana has destroyed and deactivated the magic here.
 
One frost giant sits here, chained with a long chain to the wall, armed and dangerous. This is not appealing guard duty so he is kept prisoner, threated with conversion to a zombie if he doesn't do his duty. His concern is that if anyone gets through and doesn't kill Morgana, she will kill him. But once he realizes he can't win, he will surrender and beg for mercy.
 
**2: Ice Gardens**
 
This enormous cavern is filled with ice sculptures. Around the walls are statues of 8 frost giants, men and women, arranged in a circle looking in at the center of the cavern. In the center of the cavern is an enormous sculpture, maybe 30 feet high. Shards of ice erupt from the group in a loose circle, maybe 15-20 feet across. There are probably 30 or 40 of them, in total. About 5 or 10 feet from the ground, each shard turns into a carven ice statue of a weapon: swords, staffs, hammer, axes, spears are all represented. These are larger than life, each weapon perhaps 15-20 feet tall. Winding around the hafts and blades are giant runes.
 
The cold is particularly intense here, and these statues are enchanted to make them as hard as ice. Morgana has not yet figured out how to break the enchantment, and she and her minions avoid this room.
 
**3: Sun Garden**
 
There are three great cracks in the ceiling of this enormous cavern that let the sunlight shining from the glacier above reflect through the ice walls of this cavern. Curving panels of ice extend from the walls to create a series of semi-private spaces, each with a giant-sized hard bench of ice.
 
Depending on time of day play up the beauty of the ice reflections in the sunlight, all sorts of colors of blue and white and even gold.
 
At night, Morgana's mephit servants sleep here: 12 ice mephits. During the day they can be found elsewhere on errands or otherwise engaged.
 
**4: Store Room**
 
This was once a fairly basic store room where the frost giants kept extra meat frozen for the kitchens. Now, it is fairly barren, just one half-eaten carcass of a giant elk.
 
**5: Great Hall**
 
This was once the meeting room and council chamber of the frost giants charged with the management and control of the elemental shard. The ground floor has a huge oval table made of ice that can fit six giants around it. The balcony has ice benches built into the wall.
 
Morgana has turned this into the guard room and entrance to her domain. An animated breath (cold form), a giant-sized helmed horror, and 2 ice mephits guard here. The mephits take shifts, but the animated breath does not need to sleep, eat, or drink.
 
All the exits have been extended and carved out by Morgana, so here is where the terrain shifts.
 
The western exit leads down to the dungeons, and has a permanent alarm spell that triggers if any creature who is not elemental or fey passes the threshold.
 
The northern exist leads to Morgana's chambers, and is untrapped until later.
 
The sourthern exit leads to the shard room, and is untrapped until later.
 
**6: Temple Entry**
 
This is the frost giant entrance to the elemental ice chamber. The cavern is bisected by a wall of ice, in which an enormous door of ice stands. It is protected from the simple expedient of being so cold that to even approach it causes damage to those who are not immune to cold.
 
The door is solid and heavy, requiring a DC 15 Strength check to move. Touching the door causes 2d6 cold damage every round (no save).
 
Once the door is opened, anyone passing through the entry must make a DC 16 CON save or take 6d6 cold damage (half on success).
 
Carved in giant on the wall above the door is the message: "Let only those who thrive in the cold pass and be cleansed by the frigid air."
 
**7: Temple Antechamber**
 
Big empty room, seems untouched by time or damage. Cold, very cold -- nothing but cold immunity can protect creatures from the effects of extreme cold in this room, and resting is impossible.
 
The far door is intricately paneled with geometric designs of snowflakes, and carved into the ice walls are a series of reliefs depicting the history of these giants: the elemental shard and the glacier growing around it; war with the dwarves; expansion and tribute from stoneborn villages; the Great War with death and destruction following; mourning; a peace treaty with the dwarves, the stoneborn, and the giants; trade and craft.
 
**8A: Temple of Ice**
 
A large room with a series of pillars of snow that surround a deep icy pit, shimmering blue flames casting a pale light everywhere.
 
The room is deeply, deeply cold. Every minute of time spent in the room, everyone must make a DC 14 CON save, taking 3d6 cold damage on a failure, half on a success. Any open flames are extinguished, and any fire spell of 3rd level or lower automatically fails. Water is immediately frozen.
 
If anyone enters within the ring of pillars without permission from whomever is attuned to the elemental shard, two snow golems will detach and attack. Every two rounds two more will detach until all 12 pillars have activated. If everyone leaves the circle of the pillars, they will cease attacking and return to their pillars. Once reduced to 0 hit points, a snow golem cannot be created from that pillar until 24 hours have passed.
 
The bottom of the pit is 50' below and leads to area 8b.
 
**8B: Elemental Shard**
 
A shard of ice stands in the center of this room, radiating faint blue flames and intense cold.
 
This is the elemental shard, a fragment of pure essence of ice.
 
It can be destroyed by attacking it. It has 180 hit points, an AC of 15, is immune to cold, psychic, necrotic, and poison damage, and resistant to non-magical bps, acid, and lightning. It is vulnerable to thunder and fire damage.
 
It has CON+4, WIS+4, INT+0, CHA+2, STR+0, DEX-1 saves
 
The object acts on initiative count 20 and on initiative count 10, and has 2 reactions to use.
 
On initiative count 15 the cold aura activates (as room 8A).
 
When it dies, it explodes in a burst of frigid energy. Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 16 Dex saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a success.
 
**Actions:**  
**Commanding Thought.** The shard targets a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be ==charmed== until the end of its next turn. While ==charmed== in this way, the target becomes the shard’s puppet, acting and moving in accordance with its telepathic commands. While under the shard’s control, the target can take only the ==Attack== (shard chooses the target) or ==Dash== action on its turn.
 
**Trill.** The shard emits a haunting cry. Each creature within 60 feet of the shard that can hear it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be ==stunned== for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, or if this effect ends for it, that creature is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to cold are also immune to this effect.
 
**Cold Ray.** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ **+6** to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 25 (**4d10 + 3**) cold damage.
 
**Reactions:**
 
**Cold Blast.** When it is hit with a melee attack, it can use a reaction to deal 2d6 cold damage to the attacker.
 
**Refreeze.** As a reaction to taking damage, it can refreeze, reducing the triggering damage by 3d8. It cannot use this reaction if it has taken thunder or fire damage this round.
 
May need to improvise a bit more for this.
 
It can also be attuned to, or banished back to the plane of ice.
 
To attune to it, a creature must grab the shard, making a DC 17 Con saving throw and taking 10d8 cold damage on a failure, half on a save. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, they are stable but frozen (petrified).
   

## Morgana Tunnels
 
These tunnels are smaller, only 10 feet high (a giant cannot fit) and 10 feet wide. They have clearly been recently made, and are dark, no torch brackets or anything. The crossroads is larger, and open space about 30 x 30 with 30 foot ceilings; one larger, wider corridor leads to the right, narrower corridors ahead and left.
 
**9: Frost Giant Zombie**
 
This tunnel opens into a large cavern, where Morgana has placed a frost giant zombie. Its limbs have clearly been removed and then resown, and it is coated with ice. It watches the crossroads, and will silently alert Morgana if it spots anything, and then attack.
 
It cannot die while the Elemental Shard is present: its body lies frozen when dead and will reanimate in 24 hours.
 
**10: Crevasse**
 
The end of this corridor is obscured by mist, which hides a dead end and a crevasse. Anyone who enters the mist must make a DC 15 Dex saving throw, falling into the crevasse on a failure. The crevasse drops 60' to a hard, icy floor. Anyone falling takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage. The walls are extremely slick and very difficult to scale, requiring a DC 17 Athletics check, made with advantage if using a rope. On a failure, fall to the ground again, taking 2d6 blugeoning damage. After three failures, must rest before trying again.
 
**11: Trapped corridor**
 
At the branching point, the way to Morganna's chambers is blocked by an illusion of a dead end, DC 16 to detect if they use an action to examine it.
 
About halfway towards Morgana's chambers is a glyph of warding carved on the ceiling (DC 17 to notice, so Samso will notice if they have light but not otherwise). The glyph triggers: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/rimes-binding-ice](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/rimes-binding-ice)
 
Morgana's were-polar-bear will come investigate and attack intruders when the rune triggers.
 
**12: Morgana's chambers**
 
This is the entry chamber and workroom of Morgana's domain. There is a table made of ice, on which are several scrolls with arcane drawing and notes, written in Sylvan. If anyone speaks / reads Sylvan, they can decipher that these are notes dating back about 1 year, and are a series of experiments on the ice shard, trying to figure out how to control it and widen its power to turn the mountains into an icy domain for Morgana.
 
An ice shelf is littered with various treasures:

- A loose bundle of notes detailing Morgana's transformation from an annis hag to a bheur hag.
- Four leather bags of various descriptions:
    - One looks old and worn, and seems empty (Bag of Holding); if emptied, it contains a gelatinous cube
    - Two are distinctive horse designs, and are full of odd coins (200 gp)
    - One is black leather, and holds a substantial silver neck chain, short but sturdy enough to hold its heavy pendant. The pendant is a square of hammered silver, inlaid with rectangles of orange-red, green and blue stone [carnelian, malachite and lapis lazuli; 244 gp]. Inside is also a small black velvet pouch with three perfect pink pearls [100 gp each].
- Two potion bottles; one is light blue (water breathing), the other is swirling red (fire resistance)
- An immovable rod
- A scroll of "Speak with Dead"
- A scroll of "Magic Circle"
- A box made of thin, woven strips of leather and finished with brass corners, hinges and latch [16 gp]. It is a hand-span square and half that tall. In it is a bracelet of hammered silver squares and rectangles, linked so it is slightly flexible and sized to fit a woman’s wrist [6 gp].
- A collection of small pewter figures. There are 20 in all; 10 are fashioned as dwarven warriors carrying longswords and the other 10 are fierce orcs with battleaxes [2 gp each].
- An elaborate stone chess set, sized slightly too big for human hands, each piece sculpted out of a different mineral [50 gp]
 
**13: Morgana's bedchamber**
 
A plain room where Morgana sleeps and rests.
 
There is a slab of ice that serves as a bed, and a wardrobe containing various mundane cloaks and robes in icy/wintery colors.
 
A against the wall rests a silver mirror in a striking frame shaped like an eight-pointed star [196 gp]. The frame is wooden, with detailed edging, painted a glossy black and the center space is more than large enough to show a person’s face. The four long points stretch an arm’s length from tip to tip, while the intervening points are shorter.
 
On a small table sits a seemingly mundane gold piece. Anyone who touches it gains the unshakable belief that this is the very first gold coin minted by humanity.
 
There is also a music box. When wound and played, anyone who can hear the music is under the effects of Irresistible Dance. Music lasts for 1 minute, and then needs a day to recharge.
 
In a small chest under the table:

- The bloated corpse(s) of a frog or toad. When thrown onto the ground as a bonus action, it erupts in a cloud of noxious gas similar to the _Stinking Cloud_ spell (nerf or buff radius number as needed for the group level). One time use.
- A mystery key: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/mystery-key](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/mystery-key), but carved out of bone
- A preserved dwarves head with a long braided beard. While carrying this underground, the bearer of this item always knows the item’s depth below the surface and the direction to the nearest staircase, ramp, or other path leading upward
- A solid block of ice that does not melt. When placed in a volume of water no larger than 10' x 10' x 10', the water instantly freezes. One use.
- Goggles of night
 
**14: Morgana's storeroom**
 
This is a storeroom.
 
Two large barrels [2 gp each] rest in the corner. As you approach them you see they both have sealed lids. After breaking the seal and opening the lid on the first barrel you see it is filled with a reddish liquid. [If someone tastes the liquid or does something to determine what the liquid is:] You find the liquid is red wine and it appears to still be drinkable and quite tasty [equivalent of 40 bottles of fine wine in this barrel; 385 gp]. You break the seal on the other barrel, expecting to possibly find more wine. Instead you find the barrel is filled with gold, copper and silver coins [239 gp, 5673 sp, 6,207 cp], probably taken from the local dwarves.
 
One additional barrel holds water, and one holds preserved meat.
 
The secret door to the ice chamber requires a DC 18 Perception check to notice.
 
**15: Torture chamber**
 
Two stoneborn villagers are trapped here, awaiting Morgana's attention. They are watched by **3 ice mephits**; if intruders arrive, one ice mephit will immediately flee to alert Morgana, the other will activate a rune that summons **three snow golems**.
 
The stoneborn villagers can talk about the ice magic of Morgana to turn people into berserkers for her army. They wander the mountains rounding up anyone who dares to challenge her dominion.
 
An empty brazier sits in the floor, this is used by Morgana for her transformations, powered by the elemental shard.
 
**16: Ice Passage**
 
This passage leads to the elemental shard chamber.
 
The door is sealed with an arcane lock, the password is "Unfreeze" in Sylvan. It is made of solid stone and cannot be destroyed by force.
 
Attempting to pick the lock will trigger a magical trap (keyed to the same password), which will send 6 icicles shooting out of the door. Each has a +6 to hit, chooses a target within 10 feet of the door at random, and does 1d6+3 piercing damage plus 1d6 cold damage on a hit. Anyone hit by 2 or more icicles is slowed (movement reduced by half) for 10 minutes.
