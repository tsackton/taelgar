## Intro
 
_It has been a pleasant month since the battle with Grumella. Samso and Aelar have spent most of the time training, learning new skills and feats. Aglath has been impatiently waiting for his new armor: jet black plate mail of black iron, forged with ruby flame designs that seem to shimmer and shift, flickering like fire. Adrik has been anxiously waiting as the mages of the library here have taken Thunderbrand, adding to its magic. Brelith has also been waiting for armor, a shimmering set of plate mail with a gold dragon emblem etched on the front._
 
_During this month, you have also been furnishing your new home, a manor house just inside the walls of Voltara, near the temple square, a three-story building with a courtyard garden, which Friend has taken quite a liking to._
 
### Staffing your Manor
 
Need to make some decisions about staffing your manor. At a minimum, you'll need to hire a steward to manage the place and watch over it while you adventure. You'll also probably want to hire some servants: a cook, perhaps a few butlers.
 
Skilled servants will cost 2 gp per day: this will include cook and steward at a minimum, but could also include other help you want if there is something you are looking for in particular.
 
Unskilled servants (porters, butlers, messengers/errand runners) will cost 2 sp per day. You'll need at least 2 unskilled servants to assist each skilled servant.
 
You need to pay your staff whether you are in town or not, which means leaving money with the steward.
 
When you are in town, you also need to pay for food:  
Plain, filling: 5 sp per person per day  
Elaborate: 8 sp per person per day  
Extravagant: 2 gp per person per day
 
(this does not include servants, their salary includes food and lodging)  
----  
Leave 750 gp

4 gp, 6 sp per day  
4 gp per day for food

### Other events during the month
 
_During the past month, you've been the talk of the town. The pronconsul has invited you to several banquets in your honor, and the prayers of thanksgiving at the temple, lead by Galius, featured you as star guests. Wherever you travel through the town, the townsfolk great you, thank you, and give you gifts. You've managed to acquire another 200 gp this way over the course of the month._
 
_Three weeks' ago, Orin Strongaxe and his warriors left, reminding you of your promise to come when you could to help them figure out the troubles on their southern border. A week later, the centaurs left, heading south to winter in the valley. Before they left, Aris thanked you again, still walking with a limp, but at peace with her new role as an advisor and leader of her people, even if not at the front of a battle column._
 
_A week ago, the legions from the south finally arrived. Marcus Tuso, commander of the Voltara guard, praised your valor, and you were again guests of honor in banquet in the legion commander's honor. The Chardonian legions' arrival put the mind of the Proconsul at ease, and he gave you his blessing to venture forth on your adventures._
 
_Over the last week, you've finished your final business in Voltara, as the various magic items have arrived and your training has completed. Now, it is mid November, and a constant chill is in the air as you prepare to set out east towards Am'khazar, Brelith's home. The journey is long - more than 500 miles, first southeast across the plains and rivers, then through the forested foothills of the great mountains to the western entrances to Am'khazar. At a hard march, it will still take nearly 3 weeks, and more at a more reasonable pace._
 
_Before you set out, what supplies would you like to acquire?_
 
### Supplies
 
They have horses already; assume they will need a cart and three weeks of rations, barrels of water, etc. Can also buy potions of healing, etc. Diamonds for revivify.
 
## Setting Out
 
_You leave Voltara on a cool November morning, a chill in the air and low clouds hinting at the first snow flurries of winter. Crowds gather outside the east gate as you set out, amid furious construction and rebuilding as the outer town rises from the ashes of Grumella's attack._
 
### Choosing a pace
 
You need to decide how hard you want to push. [Travel pace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#TravelPace).
