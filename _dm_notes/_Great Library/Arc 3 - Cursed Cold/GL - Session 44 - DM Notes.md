**Extreme Cold**  
==Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of== **exhaustion**==. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.==  
In addition, resting is difficult. The chill in the air makes sleep hard to come by and even with warm weather gear it can be hard to get a rest.
 
To take a short rest, the party needs to get a fire going and set up a sheltered camp; DC 15 Survival check, on pass short rest takes normal time, otherwise 2 hours.
 
To get a long rest is tougher. Everyone attempting to sleep must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If they have a nice camp (DC 15 or better survival) these saving throws are made with advantage. On a failure, recover spell slots and class resources but no HP from resting and only 1/4 level hit dice. On a failure \> 5, also gain one level of exhaustion.
 
## Session Script
 
The party, having just emerged from the frozen city of Tumukhar, needs to find a place to rest. Afterward, they brave the dangers of the frozen mountains looking for a Stoneborn village, where they meet Moondweller. From Moondweller, they learn the source of the cold is the glacier that flows around the old frost giant stronghold in the mountains. Traveling with Moondweller, they travel across the mountains to the stronghold. The session ends as they get their first glimpse of the glacier and the frozen stronghold of Vangebekkr.
 
## Outline
 
It is five miles to the nearest Stoneborn village, which will take a 10 hours of travel assuming no complications.
 
Use the [Mountain Travel r](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/welcome-to-the-far-north#MountainTravel)ules from RotFM, including avalanches and blizzards. Travel pace is roughly 1/2 mile per hour.
 
Emphasize the cold, the biting wind, the snowy terrain. This is difficult, unnaturally so, much worse than the mountains Dinia lived in.
 
## Random Encounters
 
Roll 1d20+1, if bigger than encounter number, use blizzard rules.
 
Remember difficulty is for level 4-6 characters, not level 8s.

Also consider:
 
- Remoraz or frost salamanders, attracted by the elemental magic (use this if the rolled encounter does not seem appropriate)
- Frost giants can be either refugees from Morgana or servants. But also use frost giants of some kind of various non-appropriate results; can also add frost giant skeletons.
- Coldlight walkers should be frozen remains of dwarves.
- Goliath werebear is a Stoneborn, could lead them to Moondweller.
- Awakened beasts spy for Morgana; reflavor frost druids as ice spirits

**STOPPED IN CAVE OF THE BERSERKERS, AREA Q4**
 
**Avalanches**  
The following rules can be used for rockslides as well as avalanches.  
An avalanche is a mass of snow and debris falling rapidly down a mountainside. A typical avalanche is 300 feet wide, 150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures in the path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if they’re close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost impossible.  
When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures must roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative counts 10 and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until it can travel no more. When an avalanche moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls **prone**, and the creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
When an avalanche stops, the snow settles and buries creatures in it. A creature buried in this way is **blinded** and **restrained** and has total cover. The creature gains one level of **exhaustion** for every 5 minutes it spends buried in the snow. It can try to dig itself free as an action, breaking the surface and ending the blinded and restrained conditions on itself with a successful DC 15 Strength (**Athletics**) check. A creature that fails this check three times can’t attempt to dig itself out again.  
A creature that is not restrained or **incapacitated** can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried in the snow. Once free, that creature is no longer blinded or restrained by the avalanche.  
**Blizzards**  
The blizzards that ravage Icewind Dale and harry travelers on the mountain pass are reflections of Auril’s self-imposed isolation. A blizzard in Icewind Dale typically lasts 2d4 hours, and whenever the characters are caught in one, the following rules apply until it ends.  
A blizzard’s howling wind limits hearing to a range of 100 feet and imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. It also imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (**Perception**) checks that rely on hearing. The wind extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, erases tracks in the snow, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A creature falls at the end of its turn if it is flying by nonmagical means and can’t hover.  
Visibility in a blizzard is reduced to 30 feet. Creatures without goggles or other eye protection have disadvantage on Wisdom (**Perception**) checks that rely on sight due to blowing snow.  
Any creature that is concentrating on a spell in a blizzard must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn or lose its concentration on the spell unless the creature is sheltered against the elements (for example, in an igloo).  
**Veering Off Course.** It’s easy to veer off course while traveling through a blizzard, and it’s also easy for party members to become separated from one another, which is why the wisest course of action is to stay put and wait for the blizzard to pass.  
If the characters travel during a blizzard, have the players designate one party member as the navigator. At the end of each hour of travel through the blizzard, the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom (**Survival**) check on behalf of the navigator. On a successful check, the party stays on course. On a failed check, the party wanders off course, putting its members no closer to their destination than they were at the start of that hour. If the check fails by 5 or more and the party members aren’t tied together, one randomly determined party member becomes lost in the blizzard and separated from the others. If the group tries to reunite with its missing member, have the party members (including the missing one) make a DC 15 Wisdom (**Survival**) group check at the end of each hour. If this group check succeeds, the missing party member is found, but no progress is made toward reaching the group’s intended destination that hour. The group check can be repeated after each hour spent searching for the missing party member.
