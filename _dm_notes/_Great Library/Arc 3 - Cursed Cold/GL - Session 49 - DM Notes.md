Start on the outside of the castle in the morning, encourage some creative thinking about how to approach.
 
**Session Notes**
 
Approached castle by stealth; tried to climb with mixed success. Used silence on the door then killed mephits and the frost giant guard. Proceeded to sneak (with magical aid) to the stairs; killed two mephits, also in a cone of silence. Descended stairs; killed one frost giant skeleton, banished the other. While banished, freed one trapped giant; killed skeleton, then freed the rest of the giants and discussed briefly before splitting up, the giants to take the fortress and the party to take Morgana.
 
Fought one giant and killed it; killed both skeletons guarding prisoners, and freed the nice giants. Also killed 4 mephits (gate guards plus stair guards).
 
Now at entrance to the ice cave, with 8 giant owls.
