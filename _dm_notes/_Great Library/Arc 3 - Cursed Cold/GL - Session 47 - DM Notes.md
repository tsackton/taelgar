IN GAME NOTES:
 
Start at Stoneborn village, introduce Moondweller
 
Talk to Moondweller, learned:

- Some frost giants evil
- Corruption growing from ice
- Destroy hag to stop ice
 
Approach castle via side of glacier.
 
Not stealthy, noticed by artic fox and then also guards, so won't have advantage of surprise necessarily.
   

IN THE CASTLE:
 
Outside, near stairs up: pen with 4 mammoths and 1 frost giant tending them. This is a frost giant that has been swayed by Morgana, but not with magic, just promise of treasure and power.
 
Walls - stone and ice.
 
Killed skeleton guard without alarm sounded, so now on the roof and probably not going to be obviously alerted beyond general "intruders in the area, on guard."

**STOPPED:**
 
On roof of Vangebekkr, having killed skeleton guard, current time just after sunset, dim light of twilight.
