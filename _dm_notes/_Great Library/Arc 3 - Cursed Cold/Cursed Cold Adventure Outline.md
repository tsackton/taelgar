1. Party learns rumors of what is happening in Zarkandur, and in particular should get a clue about the Stoneborn villages nearest to whatever is happening. Also asked to go see what they can do, if this spreads farther even Zarkandur will fall. Messengers have been sent to other kingdoms, but none have returned yet. Should also learn some rumors about the frost giants, etc.
2. Party travels south underground with a dwarf escort until they reach the southernmost city, now abandoned. Here they can search for clues, but dwarf escort will leave. Possible easy battle here, introduce some ice themes.
3. Party emerges from the underground to travel overland, looking for the source of these problems. Encounters include mountain dangers, random monster encounters, weird regional effects, and the remains of the Stoneborn village where NPC sits in meditation. From NPC can learn about the frost giants and the glacier as the probable source of the trouble. Offers to come.
4. Party travels to glacier where they encounter the former fortress of the frost giants, tunnels of ice under the glacier, and finally the hag's lair above the elemental shard.
5. Party defeats the hag coven, stopping the ritual, and then takes or destroys the shard, returning to Zarkandur victorious.
