## Intro
 
_We start as you are finishing lunch and a brief rest on an unseasonably warm November day, camped a few hundred yards down the track from piles of dead orc bodies, the remains of what seems like a relatively poor band of orcs, perhaps survivors of the battle of Voltara, seeking revenge for the death of Grumella._
 
_The cart track continues east, towards the garrison camp and eventually the mountains of Brelith's home._
 
_Is there anything you want to do before you continue east?_
 
**REMEMBER TO ASK WHO HAS MANTLE OF SPELL PROTECTION, WHO HAS RING OF WATER WALKING**
 
## Scenes
 
**Orcs**
 
If they search, a DC 11 Survival check to follow tracks, which will lead back to the orc camp, where the remaining orcs are.
 
If they don't search, the remaining orcs will note their companions did not return, and will track them and ambush them in the night.
 
[Treasure](Orc%20Attack%20-%20DM%20Notes.md) at the camp, if they follow and search.

**NOTES**
 
Skipped orc camp -- two fangs got away, will plot revenge, but little they can do as the Chardonian legion will attack. Figure the legion deals with these, finds the treasure, learns this is where the messengers went.
 
Skipped river fort -- bullywug threat will grow, devastating the fort, but will hibernate for the winter.
 
Made deal to handle spiders with Hakar, leader of the mountain people. Maybe find a clue in the spider lair about a dragon?
