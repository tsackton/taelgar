**[[Loma]]:** youngish girl, maybe 13/14, skinny and quick, braided red hair, eager to explore and incredibly good at hiding, knows the woods and is blessed by Wenba, the spirit of the village whom she attracts and appeases with small sacrifices, mostly burning things but the occasional small animal especially when hunting for food. She will take party south if they deal with spiders.
 
Try to end session as they head south into the woods, hoping to arrive at Brelith's in 10 days time or so.
