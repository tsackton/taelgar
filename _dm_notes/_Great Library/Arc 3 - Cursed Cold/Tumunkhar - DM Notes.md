**General Notes**
 
The area of Tumunkhar is at the edge of the area of extreme cold being manipulated by Morgana. It feels freezing all the time and is impossible to get warm. The entire region counts as an area of extreme cold:
 
**Extreme Cold**  
==Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of== **exhaustion**==. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.==  
In addition, resting is difficult. The chill in the air makes sleep hard to come by and even with warm weather gear it can be hard to get a rest.
 
To take a short rest, the party needs to get a fire going and set up a sheltered camp; DC 15 Survival check, on pass short rest takes normal time, otherwise 2 hours.
 
To get a long rest is tougher. Everyone attempting to sleep must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If they have a nice camp (DC 15 or better survival) these saving throws are made with advantage. On a failure, recover spell slots and class resources but no HP from resting and only 1/4 level hit dice. On a failure \> 5, also gain one level of exhaustion.
 
**Areas**
 
1. This is the entrance from the long road. As the party approaches it will be locked and barred from the outside (the side they approach from). Normally would be a toll station / transfer point / welcome center, now feels weirdly empty and cold.
2. This is one of the main sections of town, a series of dwellings, workshops, and the like built on a series of upward-sloping streets. Ice clings to the walls of the buildings and travel is difficult - the whole area counts as difficult terrain. If they poke around, may encounter random loot (just make up some big stuff that would be in a dwarven house, or look at [rings](https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9741/), [necklaces](https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9799/) for more valuable stuff. May also encounter traps/dangers here:
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|Ice has cracked the stone roof of the building and searching causes it to collapse. DC 12 Dex save to duck out of the way. Success = 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Failure = 2d6 bludgeoning damage plus are grappled (DC 18 Str to escape) and take 1d4 cold damage each round.|
|2|Two ice mephits lurk in this building. Will attempt to flee and raise alarm.|
|3|Blast of ultra-cold air billows out of the building. DC 14 Dex save, 3d10 cold damage, half on success. Four frozen bodies of dwarves are inside, look like a family.|
|4|One coldlight walker rises from a body in the house, seeking warmth.|
 
1. Similar to 2, but nicer area, more likely to find treasure.
2. This is a major trade plaza / market, now abandoned of course. There are plenty of mudane goods to find, all frozen.
3. This is the "center of town", a small plaza marked by a statue of a dwarf holding two axes above her head.
4. This is the parade grounds, one of the few areas that has actually been partially destroyed. Now home to an ice troll, and a handful of snow golems. The ice troll is lazy, usually sending the snow golems to search through houses to find frozen bodies to eat. He is supposed to be guarding the exit and send mephits to warn Morgana if anyone comes through.
    1. If during the course of traveling ice mephits are alerted and get away, the troll will be warned and will call back the snow golems, so the party will face the ice troll plus 3 snow golems and 3 ice mephits. He will also send 2 ice mephits to warn Morgana, so she will be on alert.
    2. Otherwise, will face the ice troll and 3 ice mephits only.
    3. If they kill troll and no mephits get away for warning, then Morgana will eventually know that someone has been here, but not who or what; will actually put her on edge
5. Barracks and military quarters/planning/storeroom. Some weapons left but a lot taken. Nothing much here to find.
6. Main exit. The ice troll is supposed to be guarding this, but he is lazy and prefers to lounge around the parade ground area. However, the exit is not without its dangers, for the final gate has been rigged to trigger an avanlanche if opened. Detecting the trap is fairly easy, requiring only a DC 15 Perception check, but disarming it is challenging, DC 20. The mechanism is basically a taught wire that keeps the gate from swinging open and when pressure is released triggers a boom that sets off the avalanche. If the avanlanche triggers, everyone caught within must make a DC 15 Strength check, taking 2d8 cold and 2d8 bludgeoning on a failure (half on success). On a failure, also buried under 1d6+5 feet of snow. Can dig out of a few feet per minute, have CON mod minutes of air. From top can dig more easily but requires locating the buried person.
7. Temple of the Bahrazel. If they search carefully, can find a hidden chest with four potions of cold resistance and a note saying "Any true hearted hero who finds these, take them and use them to end this eternal winter."
8. Workshops, artisan's part of town. Unless summoned by ice troll due to alarm, three snow golems are rummaging for bodies here.
9. Storerooms, where food and water for the settlement is kept, now all completely frozen.
