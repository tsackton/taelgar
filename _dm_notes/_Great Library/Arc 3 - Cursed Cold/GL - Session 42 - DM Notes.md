Arrival in Zarkandur [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsnMw2cyfWjUfg6EAzpJSsGCPIbdgALfFjZqoqYhwqA/edit#heading=h.zca0vxt8vnrx](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsnMw2cyfWjUfg6EAzpJSsGCPIbdgALfFjZqoqYhwqA/edit#heading=h.zca0vxt8vnrx)
 
Give a brief rundown of the city, as they walk through to Brelith's home.  
Brelith's home is fancy  
Parents: Diesa (mom) and [[Osrik]] (dad)
 
Welcome with a big feast. Happy to see him, worried about rumors of trouble to the south, things have gotten much worse. The city of Tumunkhar, the southernmost output of the kingdom of Am'khazar, about 7 days travel south, had to be abandoned as penetrating cold made it unlivable, even deep underground. All the surface settlements near it are also abandoned. People are scared.
 
Many refugees now in living in Highside and some even in Brightcave. Not sure what we'll do if this cold spreads here.
 
Can talk to people in town before they go, if they want. Potential places of interest:

- Refugees in Highside, or lingering in the taverns of the undercity
- Academy in Crystalrun
- The government offices in Highside
- The markets of Brightcave, or perhaps the Temple in Brightcave
 
## Secrets and Clues
 
- In the desolation south of Am'khazar, there is supposedly a great glacier that grows bigger every year. Frost giants are rumored to make it their home, but none have every dared venture belowground into the dwarven strongholds.
- The magic of the elemental planes combines at the edges of the realms, so between fire and water is a land of endless steam, between water and air is a realm of ice and snow, between air and earth is a realm of dust, and between earth and water is a realm of mud.
- There are Stoneborn who live in small villages on the mountain peaks. Some have fled, but it is said they can protect themselves from cold and some may know what is happening, if you can find them. The dwarves of Tumunzhar traded with them occasionally, if you exit the undercaves there you may find a path.
- Messengers have been sent to other kingdoms, but none have returned. We are on our own, for now.
- A group of young dwarves who liked to test their mettle in the fighting ring in the undercity, calling themselves the Axebrothers, left three weeks ago saying they would deal with this if the elders would not. None have returned, and now are feared dead.
- It was a strange fall. The first frost was in August, far earlier than normal, and the first big snowfall in September. By November, the bitter cold made the surface towns uninhabitable and we fled underground, until a few weeks ago, when even the refuge and city of Tumunkhar, at the southern frontier, started to feel cold and night, and fires would not give off heat. We had to flee. Ice would form everywhere.
- The night before we fled Tumunkhar, I awoke to see a small group of creatures, they looked like imps or small devils with wings and laughing, evil faces, but they appeared as if made of ice. They were creeping through town, and everything they touch froze. I stayed silent and they did not notice me.
- The frost giants have a small fortress a few days journey south of Tumunkhar, on the surface near a great glacier, but for the past two hundred years they have been peaceful and quiet, even trading occasionally. But none have been seen since last June, until this cold started.
- (from a Tumunkhar survivor): rumors that the frost giants attacked several Stoneborn villages, strange behavior for them.
- It is rumored that the frost giants had some secret control over the glacier, that they could command it to shape itself as they wished, making beautiful, lifelike sculptures of ice. But some say this power could also be used to call for the cold of the glacier and even control the weather.
- It snowed for 10 days straight before we fled the surface, each day getting colder than the last. If you are going south, make sure to be prepared for the cold, ice, and snow!
 
## Travel South
 
The travel along the Long Road is uneventful, and the party has an escort of household guards from Brelith's family. But the guards won't enter Tumunzhar.
 
## Tumunzhar
 
This is the border city / fortress, a place that is always on watch against the strange magic of the south. It sits in a large cavern, open to the air at one end, which has been fortified heavily.
 
## Village
 
If they leave Tumunzhar, there is a small track, now snowed over but still obvious, that leads towards the stoneborn village. They can also see the distant peaks of the mountains and the glacier in the distance.
 
If they head towards village, find Moondweller and talk to him, he can lead them to fortress and tell them a bit of history.
 
If they decide to go straight to glacier then probably just try to wrap up session, throwing a random encounter if needed.
