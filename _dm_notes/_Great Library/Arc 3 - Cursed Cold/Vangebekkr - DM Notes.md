![O Down to G5 BATTLEMENT LEVEL PALACE LEVEL Up to G...](Exported%20image%2020251029112759-0.jpeg)

Roughly speaking can improvise based on published adventure: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode#Grimskalle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode#Grimskalle)
 
However, key differences:
 
1. In the basement level, remove G15-G19. Instead, add prison cells where recalcitrant frost giants are guarded by frost giant skeletons.
2. In the basement, the G20 - G23 vault in instead the entrance to the ice caves and the heart of the glacier.
3. Outside the fortress is a mammoth pen
4. The bedrooms/palace are occupied by a frost giant servant of the hags, not the final boss.
5. The frost giant guard is totally on the side of the hag, and maybe add a second guard?
6. Should have some ice druid minions as well…? Someone guarding the mammoths?

Fortress Features  
The following features are common throughout the fortress:  
**Giant-Sized.** Furnishings, passageways, and the dimensions of the rooms inside are all sized for frost giants and other Huge creatures. The same is true of some accessory items, including treasure, as noted in the text.  
**Ice and Mist.** All surfaces (floors, ceilings, walls, and so forth) are made of smooth, opaque, chiseled ice with a bluish tinge. A 2-foot-deep blanket of cold mist creeps across the floors, which aren’t slippery unless the text states otherwise.  
**Darkness**. The fortress is lit with giant torches at regular intervals.  
**Doors.** A door is a 25-foot-high, 8-foot-wide, 2½-foot-thick slab of chiseled ice with crude handles. In place of hinges, a door has thick, cylindrical pins of ice that rest in holes at the top and bottom edges of the door’s frame. A creature can use an action to try to push open one of these doors, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (**Athletics**) check. A door is a Huge object with AC 13, hp 60, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.  
**Ceilings.** Ceilings throughout are 30 feet high.
 
This was once the home base of a tribe of 21 frost giants. Of these, 7 fled, 3 were killed and turned to skeletons, 1 was killed and turned to a zombie, 6 are working willingly with Morgana, and 4 are imprisoned in the dungeons.  
Skeletons are:  
1 on guard duty on battlements  
2 on guard duty in dungeon level  
Frost giants are:  
2 on patrol, returning to G3 + G5 to sleep.  
1 (boss) sleeps in G8, unless holding audience in G7 or reporting to Morgana  
1 (rotating) stays in the ice cave as a guard  
1 (rotating) guards the entry from G2  
1 (rotating) tends to domestic duties (cooking, mammoths, etc)

**G1. Entrance**  
The steps end in front of a double door made from slabs of ice with bones embedded in them.
 
**G2. Guard Room**  
This long, rectangular room is strewn with pieces of rotting wood and rusted metal—the remnants of giant weapons and weapon racks. A battered helmet sized for a giant lies near the back wall. It appears a battle took place here some months ago. A frost giant sits, leaning against a giant greataxe, in front of the open doors, watching the entrance.  
Morgana killed three frost giant resisters here. They are now the skeletal frost giants cursed to guard their former home.
 
_Combat: 1 frost giant_
 
**G3. Sleeping quarters.**  
Depending on time of day, may be occupied or not. Five piles of snow and stone make crude beds, sized for giants. Next to each is a locked chest.  
Across chests is frost giant treasure. Look in treasure horde list. Each chest should be 50 gp worth, more or less. No magic.
 
_Treasure:_  
_A rolled and bound rug: small, darkly hued, made of thick wool, depicting mountain peaks and clouds [21 gp]_  
_Five grey-and-white beaver pelts [3 gp each]_  
_Silver carafe decorated with snowflake patterns [35 gp]_  
_Four giant-sized silver beer steins, decorated with animal motifs: a mammoth, an eagle, a fox, and a raven. [40 gp each]_  
_Scattered coins [22 gp, 435 sp, 2430 cp]_
 
**G4. Kitchen**  
Empty, but perfectly functioning kitchen sized for giants. Lots of frozen meat and beer. May be a giant here if it is near mealtimes.
 
**G5. Feast Hall**  
Shattered chunks of ice, the remains of a door, lie strewn on the floor around the opening, allowing characters to see into the room beyond without obstruction.
 
In the middle of this immense hall stands a thirty-foot-long, ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high dining table carved from ice and surrounded by a dozen blocks of ice that serve as chairs. Wooden braces against the west wall hold a pair of fourteen-foot-long bugles made from hollowed-out mammoth tusks. An ascending staircase of ice in the southwest corner has mist rolling down it.
 
Both of the mammoth tusk bugles are intact. These bugles were used to summon frost giants for dinner or to sound an alarm. If it is near dinnertime, a bugle may be sounded to summon all the frost giants for meals.
 
_Stairs Up._ The stairs climb 90 feet to area G7.
 
**G6. Perched Mephits**  
Six slender, gargoyle-like creatures made of ice squat on ledges twenty feet above the ground that protrude from the wall of this semicircular chamber. Near the back wall, the mist that blankets the floor flows down a staircase made of polished ice.
 
The creatures perched on the ledges are six [ice mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ice-mephit) created by Morgana. They observe intruders quietly. If any of them are threatened or harmed, they all attack. Otherwise, the mephits take no aggressive action without a command from their creator.
 
_Stairs Down._ The stairs, which descend 90 feet to [area G10](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode#G10IceRink), are slippery. The slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves on these stairs for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check or fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature also tumbles 10 feet down the stairs and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
 
**G7. Throne Room**  
This semicircular room has a forest of icicles hanging from its ceiling, some of them as much as eight feet long. Against the curved wall to the south stands an enormous throne of ice decorated with carved images of winter wolves and mastodons. Across from the throne on the north wall is an open doorway.
 
The throne belonged to Vassavicken, the frost giant queen who originally occupied Vangebekkr. Now it is used by Grarskr, who rules as a servant of Morgana.
 
Morgana has transformed seven of the icicles that cling to the ceiling into [creatures that resemble piercers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/piercer-ice-variant). They use the [piercer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/piercer) stat block, have immunity to cold damage, and deal 10 (3d6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage on a hit. They can be commanded by Grarskr if he is here, otherwise they will attack anything that is not made of ice and snow, or a frost giant, that enters the room.
 
Stairs Down. The stairs in the northwest corner of this room descend 90 feet to [area G5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode#G5FeastHall).
 
_Combat:_ Except at mealtimes, Grarskr will usually be found in this room or his bedchambers.
 
Grarskr uses the "Frost Giant (variant)" stat block, with the following changes.
 
**Vaprak’s Rage (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** As a bonus action, the giant can enter a rage at the start of its turn. The rage lasts for 1 minute or until the giant is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated). While raging, the giant gains the following benefits:

- The giant has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws
- When it makes a melee weapon attack, the giant gains a +4 bonus to the damage roll.
- The giant has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 
Grarskr carries on his person a potion of healing (superior), three beads of force, and a bag of holding containing 480 gp in mixed coins and gems.
 
**G8. Queen’s Bedchamber**  
Grarskr uses this space as his personal sanctuary. It is decorated as a giant's bedchamber.
 
A chest of drawers (giant sized) contains a selection of high-quality furs. Although bulky and heavy, if transported could fetch up to 100 gp.
 
_Stairs Up_. The curved staircase climbs 90 feet to area G9.
 
**G9. Crowned Rooftop**  
The icy crown encircling the fortress doubles as a battlemented rooftop. Each prong of the crown extends forty feet above the roofline, and the prongs have 10-foot-wide gaps between them.
 
== DUNGEON LEVEL ==
 
**G10. Ice Rink**  
The staircase descends into a vaulted chamber. A nine-foot-high railing of sculpted ice hugs the staircase as it descends to the chamber floor, which, like the stairs, is smooth and gleaming. Two giant skeletons, carrying great axes and wearing nothing but spiked iron boots, stand at guard, inattentively.
 
The frost giant guards will attack anyone who enters, but are not paying too much attention unless the fortress is on alert.   Rink. The floor in this area is as smooth as an ice rink. When a creature moves on the floor for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check or fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). The giants doesn’t need to make this check due to their boots.
 
Stairs Up. From the ceiling to the floor, the stairs that lead up to [area G6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode#G6PerchedMephits) are enclosed by thick, 9-foot-high railings of sculpted ice. The stairs, like the floor, are difficult terrain. When a creature moves on these stairs for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics)) check or fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature also tumbles 10 feet down the stairs and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
 
**North**
 
To the north is the prisons. A short corridor has four large, icy cells off it. In each cell is one frost giant, locked up. The keys are kept with Grarskr. The locks can be picked (DC 17), but it is not easy.
 
The frost giants can tell the whole story about Morgana's arrival, etc. Maybe hint she was fleeing someone to the south, etc.
 
**South**
 
Storage rooms, full of frozen meat and the like.
 
**East**
 
Armory. Weighted nets, giant greataxes, massive ballista sized javelins. Massive giant shields.
 
**West**
 
Entrance to [Glacier Caves- DM Notes](Glacier%20Caves-%20DM%20Notes.md).

**CURRENT SITUATION**
 
The frost giants are on alert and wary of attack.
 
Of the 6 giants:  
1 remains on guard duty for Morgana  
2 are on lookout duty on the top of the castle  
1 is on guard duty in the front hall [dead]  
1 is searching for mammoths  
1 (the king) is brooding in his throne room awaiting orders from Morgana
 
The six mephits are assigned to fly around and patrol: 2 outside high up around the roof, 2 on the first floor, 2 watching the stairs
 
**HINTS**
 
You know there are 5 giants in the castle. They are on guard, so stealth is tricky, although not impossible. But a distraction is probably needed, or a way to calm/charm monsters, or a way to be extra stealthy.
