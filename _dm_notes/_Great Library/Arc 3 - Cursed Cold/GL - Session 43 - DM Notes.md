Searching, can turn up more mephits, they should be common and have some that Samso spots before they are seen, some that are another chase scene, some a bit more difficult to stop
 
**Remember Samso has disadvantage on perception since the whole area is dim light**  
**Ask them about driftglobe, if using it is fairly obvious if it is something they are moving**
 
Maybe one with a coldlight walker if want something a bit more challenging to go with mephits
 
If they go to dark area, have snow golem encounter, this area is true darkness, everywhere else is dim light
 
Ice troll fight
 
Exit, avalanche trap
