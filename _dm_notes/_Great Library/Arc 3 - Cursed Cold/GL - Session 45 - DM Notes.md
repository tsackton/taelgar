## Session Script
 
The party explores the Cave of the Beserkers, eventually learning the secret that the caves are connected to the unnatural cold of the mountains. Emerging from the cave, they can see the giant fortress to the east and the stoneborn village to the west.
 
If they travel to the village, they will meet Moondweller and learn more about the glacier and the invasion of the frost. If they travel to the frozen stronghold of Vangebekkr, they will begin to uncover the frost giant conflicts.
