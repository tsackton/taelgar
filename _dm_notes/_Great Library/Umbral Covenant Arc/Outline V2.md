Facts to connect:

(1) There is -- was -- a war between a queen of a northern fey realm (somewhere proximate to the mountains north of Voltara in the material plane) and an unnamed "fathomless"  entity. 
(2) Lizardfolk on the west coast have been disappearing. Mostly small, isolated villages but includes Samso's home in the Yeraad basin and also villages in the north aboleth territory (e.g. Suwi), called NR 5 in [[West Coast History Framework]]. Might also include some lizardfolk near [[Lake Valandros]]. 
(3) Aboleth hiding on the coast of NR 5 was in league with remnants of the Umbral Convenant, who were working behind the scenes somehow to recruit an army to revive the Umbral Convenant. Or at least this is what Dinia claimed? It is clear that the sigils in the ruins were the same as those left in lizardfolk villages and are connected to the Umbral Conclave. 
(4) [[War of the Dark Rift]], [[Umbral Covenant]], [[Apporia]], etc have backstory of the Umbral Convenant, which is pretty minimal except:
- War of Dark Rift started in the interior of Apporia
- Many of the nonhumans living there were wiped out
- Ended when Shadow Armanda was launched against Chardon but defeated
- Has a strong "Shadowfell" flavor so need a good domain of shadow here. 


Mysteries:
- How was the Umbral Covenant able to compel or at least enlist the aid of an aboleth?
- Why at they geographically so dispersed?
- Why lizardfolk specifically?

Constraints:
- Don't want a multilayered mystery. Want a clear end to each mini-arc, although there can be connections. 

**Option 1**

Original idea was that Umbral Convenant and aboleth were both servants of the same master, some kind of shadowfell aberration with hidden bases scattered around, so the adventure would proceed by uncovering and destroying each base, with the "boss" ultimately connected to the feywild war too. I think this is not ideal though. 

**Option 2**

One possibility is disentangling the feywild war from the Umbral Covenant. In this framing, the fathomless gets tied to the plane of water and we have a high level elemental planes arc that ties in Zadkai and the elemental scrolls as well. 

Here, the focus of the Umbral Covenant is the shadowfell domain and the darklord. But this raises some concerns about why an aboleth which feels a little to neatly tied to the fathomless. But, then again, the flavor of the fathomless is less cosmic horror / aberration and more ancient water elemental. 

Maybe check with Mi'sol about Mabist's patron? Make sure not overwriting any ideas. 

=== Final Version: Lizardfolk Arc ===

Domain of Dread in Apporia, connected to the Umbral Convenant. Should have vibes of mind control, dreamworld, perhaps similar to https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/vrgtr/icath. 
After the defeat of the Shadow Armada, retreated and more or less dropped away from the material plane to brood. 
More recently, started experimenting again. 

Connect to Samso backstory, but not Mabist - use the elemental arc, should we get to it, to run that

=== Blue ===

okay, so need a way to connect Blue to the domain of dread / umbral covenant / etc 
basically have the crystal / how she escaped to work with
a little tricky since it probably *doesn't* connect to plaguelands in any meaningful way

really probably need to develop the Domain of Dread first, then figure out who would be aware and opposed to it


=== Final Details about Umbral Covenant ===

The Umbral Covenant is a recurring war, triggered by the Darklord of a Domain of Dread associated with nightmares, shadows, evil dreams, illusions, and anchored to the material plane in the mountains of Apporia. 
- There have been at least three defeats since the domain appeared (maybe add one more in the collapse of Drankor and adjust to make the timing more ragged)
	- D1: During the Drankorian Empire, maybe early in the great peace, between  650-750, during the "Great Peace", a resounding defeat
	- D2: ~400-500 years later, in the 1100s or maybe early 1200s, reappears in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, and is defeated before the emergence of Castrella as a major power. This is when the "hero of the cystal" fights. Hero has some plane-touched connection - maybe aasimar-ish? maybe fiendish
	- D3: ~400-500 years later, during the [[War of the Dark Rift]]. This is a setback, not nearly as significant a defeat, and mostly involved just cutting of the material plane. the main power of the darklord was barely touched
	- Now, the darklord is working behind the scenes to re-emerge, manipulating dreams via lizardfolk. 
- During the D2 fight, a hero sacrificed themselves, in the process causing a major blow to the Darklord. as part of their sacrifice, by some means TBD, their essence is imprinted in a crystal. 
- Over the course of the next 500ish years, the crystal slowly makes its way east, being traded and sold, and its connection to the hero and the umbral wars are forgotten, until it ends up in Isingue before the Great War
- When the mad scientist hobgoblins invade the plaguelands, discover the crystal. for a while it is kind of inert, but triggers something in Blue. slow process - need a way for Blue to be imprisoned for nearly 100 years. maybe takes some experimenting to get things going, etc. maybe keeps trying to use Blue to "turn" others. 
- Eventually, Blue and the crystal bond, and Blue has a wild magic surge that results in random teleportation. Blue is disoriented and just gets flashes of a memory about the Umbral Covenant. Crystal is scared. Blue finds a letter and brings it to Silver Tempests, where our adventure begins.
