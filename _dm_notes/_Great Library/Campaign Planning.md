## Whispers of the Old Gods

The next campaign arc involves the war between an ancient terror of writhing shadows, a elder evil from the far realm, and the fae, led by the queen of Dreamhaven. 

Years ago, Vril'ghaal, Harbinger of the Shadowed Tides, crashed through the multiverse into the shadowfell (something like that).

Basic idea is to fuse together:
- Aboleth lair in Where Evil Lives
- Orchards of the Invisible Mountain from Radiant Citadel
- some kind of intervening shadowfell / undead plot

Basic idea is some elder evil / old god of the far realm triggered a war in the Feywild (this is Marco's new character's backstory). Connected to this war is the spreading evil through the waters of the west, of which the aboleth lair is one manifestation and the lizardfolk disappearance is another. 

Should eventually lead to a raid into the Shadowfell on the lair of the BBEG. 

Basic story beats would be:
1. Marco is being hunted by the aboleth; assassin shows up at Dinhia's, they kill it, get a clue, and she sends him to party
2. Follow clues that leads them to aboleth lair; defeat aboleth and begin to uncover connections to lizardfolk disappearances, cursed waters, and Marco's lost memories
3. (interlude - see where things go )
4. eventually end up in shadowfell, track down missing lizardfolk and lair of another aspect of elder evil
5. finally have to go to feywild, close portal to far realm and destroy the influence of the eldritch horror leaking into material world

Should take them through level 14. 

Then have another time skip / interlude, and then launch elemental arc.


(level 13-15)

Elemental arc: Return of Zadkhai, Airion's tower, and the genie war. 

(level 15-17)

Final arc, maybe demons/devils?
