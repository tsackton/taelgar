Currently, two things are happening:
 
1. Grumella wants to deal with party, and will demand that Voltara turn them over
2. Grumella is hunting more magic and treasure to equip herself and her armies in advance of an attack on Voltara
 
The "orcs seeking treasure" adventure could get run if the party tries to stop orcs from getting treasure. Otherwise, mostly improvised to see how the demand for the party's heads plays out.
 
Succeed or fail, Grumella will plan attacks and increase raids. Especially if fail. Party will need to think about what they can do to help.
 
Seeking allies is possible, especially perhaps centaurs, which might require a quest/favor.  
Can think of other possible allies, especially new ones.
 
Eventually, especially if they are not actively pushing forward questline, should have an attack on a chalyte mine. I think there is something in Fantastic Adventures that could help with this.
 
## In Game Notes
 
Chardon troops arrive in 2 - 2 1/2 months  
Grumella expecting party as prisoners in next 2-3 weeks  
If decided to attack after failing to get party, would likely be 1-2 weeks after; so 3-5 weeks total from now  
Also seeking items on the plains
 
Possible targets:

- Centaurs
- Roc
- Dinia
- Djinni

Will try to send 500 dwarven soldiers. **NEED TO CHECK DISTANCE AND TRAVEL TIME.**
