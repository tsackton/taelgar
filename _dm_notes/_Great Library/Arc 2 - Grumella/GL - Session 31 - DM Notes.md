# Scenes
 
## Intro
 
-mid morning in the Wandering Toad Inn  
-getting ready to leave, Finoc Small comes packs up some food, drink for you, thanks you for honoring inn with your business, will store stuff as long as you want and have rooms ready when you return  
-Voltara is tense: the wide streets of the walled town are quiet, and the markets outside the walls are empty; not much trade coming or going, rumors of attacks, fear  
-Quiet broken by the sounds of the town garrison training in the morning in camp outside of town, growing with new recruits.  
-Message from the Proconsul: Wish you luck on your quest, I pray succeed in recruiting allies for our defense. Voltara is putting our faith in you.
 
## Shadow Dancer Attack
 
At camp, first evening, while resting. When Samso is on watch, have him roll perception. Shadows will be whispering. "Stop asking questions, fool." Then attack.
 
Make armored folks fight without armor but let people grab shields and weapons. Anyone not on watch is surprised and starts prone.
 
## Centaur Camp
 
## Will be greeted warmly when they arrive. Centaur camp is spread out, but homely. Big fire pits, lots of meat and bread and wild game. Centaurs sleep in the open, so no tents or structures, but they do have a small stone circle in the center.
 
The leader, Herasto, will welcome them. He is open to aiding Voltara, but after a spring and summer on the plains south of Voltara, their herd is turning south for the winter to continue their long migration.
 
To help, he needs to be reassured that i) there will be food and supplies coming to his tribe, to last them the winter, and ii) there will be shelter both for the young and the old of his tribe while the warriors are fighting, and after for the winter.
 
See what the party comes up with, and let them roll some Persuasion and Insight checks to aid in their roleplaying.
 
He will suggest a mountain valley in the hills to the west, a safe place to shelter. But it is infested by manticores - if the manticores are killed and the lair destroyed, it will not only be a boon to the war (as the orcs have been capturing and training manticores as support) but will allow the centaurs to safely shelter and therefore can send aid in the form of 40 warriors.

Some cryptic sayings, including cryptic names they will call people:
 
(to Samso): "Shadows linger in your presence, for what purpose or design I cannot see." Will call him Shadowcursed.
 
(to Adrik): Thunderstriker
 
(to Aelar): "The moment between darkness and light blesses you" Servant of Twilight.
 
(to Brelith): Stormcaller
 
(to Aglath): "You are a long way from home, Flameknight"
 
"We do not seek war, nor go willingly towards it. War is chaos, it cuts the threads of fate and turns the future gray and uncertain."
 
"The long stridings of our people would now take us south, to warmer suns"
 
"Home and hearth and kinship cannot be set aside to repay debts of honor."
 
## Travel Time
 
The centaur camp is about 50 miles from Voltara, north and a bit east of the lake.
 
The valley is about 30 miles west of the centaur camp.

## NPCs
 
**Herasto**: leader of the centaurs, older, wise, sage-like, speaks slowly and cryptically, calls party by his own nicknames. Sort of like a more serious Tom Bombadil.
 
**Theopheia:** Herasto's wife, a druid. She is friendly and welcoming and devoted to nature, has animals following her, will offer a prayer to the spirits before eating. Think a bit like Goldberry.
