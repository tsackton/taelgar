Two tribes of orcs have historically warred over the plains north of Voltara. While not a particularly rich resource for tribute and treasure, it is valuable hunting ground. The Burnt Claw clan historically occupied the southern part of the plains, with the Moon Skull clan to the north. Most of their resources went to fighting each other over territory, sparing Voltara.
 
Recently, however, a new leader has arisen among the Moon Skull clan, and she has rapidly conquered the Burnt Claw clan, and is looking south for resources and territory. In particular, she has started sending raiding parties to attack sheep herds and other farmland, and is gearing up for a raid on a chalyte mine to get gold and treasure to appease hobgoblin warbands to the west, and to buy weapons.
 
Her clan has set up a forward base to raid from, and also a small raiding camp near to farmland, in a small ruin.
 
Sequence of events (assuming party does nothing):

1. Rumors of attacks on animals, outlying farms.
2. Continuing raids, and searching for treasure.
3. Orc forward base, raids on mines which get the Proconsul involved
4. Attack on outskirts of Voltara itself by large orc war band, goal being scooping up as much merchant wealth as possible  
Developments:

- If the raiding camp near farms is destroyed, will delay search for treasure; have a chance to find Tomb of Iron Soldier with no orcs
- If the forward base is destroyed, will further delay escalation; will need to repair and seek allies; 2nd time forward base is occupied, war chief will be there, if she is killed the clan will turn away from Voltara
- Will have to play the developments by ear a bit, make sure to take notes and iterate the world between sessions.
