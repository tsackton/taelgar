## Prep
 
Galius will cast spells.  
Marcus Tusa will confirm plan, as will dwarves.  
Wind will start, roc will be summoned.
 
Party will charge onto battlefield
 
## Challenge 1: Hill giants
 
The hill giant / ogre battalions are coming from three directions --\> one for the main gate, one for the west gate, and one for the temple gate
 
Each group will be one hill giant plus 2 ogres.
 
==One ogre uses normal stats but with only 40 hp== (making it plausible to go down in 1 round).  
The second ogre has special abilities. Against the group Owen is in, it is an ogre bolt launcher. Against group Isaac is in, it is a chain brute. Third group is ogre howdah with two spear-wielding orcs on its back.
 
Lair actions: on round 20, roll 1d6. On a 1-2, an ogre breaks through the battle lines, on 3-4 an ogre with two dwarves chasing breaks through the battle lines, on 5-6 two dwarves break through if there is at least one new ogre on the battlefield. The new combatants attack on initiative round 20, and remain until killed.
 
**Splitting up**
 
If the party wants to split up, then have an NPC (either Orin Strongaxe or Aris) go with them -- make up both as level 6.
 
If Gabe is not playing, then just handwave that Aglath and an NPC handle one of the three groups.
 
**Sequence**
 
If the party takes each group in sequence, then give them a choice:
 
Option A: divide dwarven and centaur forces evenly, keep ogres off you during battle but run the risk that the unengaged hill giants will get through.
 
Option B: take one group first, and send most of the centaurs/dwarves to delay the other groups, but risk ogres interfering with the battle against the hill giants.
 
If they chose option A, run each battle in sequence as normal, using lair actions above. However, at the end of each battle, roll 1d20 for each surviving hill giant. On a 12 or higher, a gate is partially damaged and will be destroyed in the next 10 minutes; on a 18 or higher a gate is destroyed completely.
 
If they chose option B, change lair actions so on a 1-2 two ogres break through, on a 3-4 one ogre breaks through, on a 5 one ogre chain brute or ogre bolt launcher breaks through, and on a 6 an ogre bolt launcher makes one attack against a random party member.
 
## Interlude:
 
If after the hill giant fight no gates are destroyed, then they get a short rest and an interlude, a chance to heal up with Galius' spells and other clerics, etc.
 
If one gate has been destroyed, Galius can cast prayer of healing and a few other healing spells, but no short rest unless they want to risk the city being overrun. Run the "Defend the Gate" instead of "Grumella's Bodyguards", but add one bodyguard to Grumella fight.
 
If two gates have been destroyed, they are in real trouble. Unlikely so will need to improvise, but basically could run 2x "Defend the Gate" each with half the party, or improvise something else, or they could make a last ditch attempt to fly into the hordes and attack Grumella immediately, in which case run the normal Grumella battle but add a bunch of random orcs? See how it goes.
 
## Challenge 2a: Defend the Gate
 
If they failed to prevent the hill giants mission, the gates will be damaged and all the high powered shock troops will be called to defend the gate.
 
The gate mission from the orcs point of view: Each gate is rushed by a enraged, battle-crazed orc (Tanarukk stats), with diseased sacrifices, and a few normal orcs and spellcasters in support. The goal is for the diseased sacrifices to get into the gate, and explode, poisoning/killing the guards and opening the floodgates.
 
To run the battle: don't have the guards who form a spear/shield wall blocking the ruined gate take turns -- assume that there are orcs and guards exchanging blows all around.
 
If 0-1 diseased ones make it to the gate, then once the battle is won it can be repaired and fortified and the plan proceeds.  
If 2-3 diseased ones make it to the gate, many soldiers die, and the pestilence starts to spread, meaning the party cannot hold a siege, as food stores begin to rot, etc. Can still attack Grumella after a short rest, but mood will be tense as people start dying.  
If all 4 diseased ones make it to the gate, the gate will fall, and the city will be overrun. Fighting on the streets, destruction. Grumella will seek out the party to personally kill them. They will not get a short rest before fighting her, and things will be bad.
 
No lair actions on this one.
 
## Challenge 2: Grumella
 
If they succeed with the hill giants, can wait out a siege. Potentially get a long rest and some time before facing Grumella. If the hill giants are overrunning the city, will need to improvise.
 
Grumella's shock troops consist of:
 
Grumella (zealot barbarian homebrew)  
Zurgog (war priest of Thark)  
One lieutenant (Blade of Ilneval stats)  
One assistant priest of Thark (CR 4 Grave Priest stats from NPC compendium plus from D&D Beyond Homebrew)  
Three acolytes of Thark (Orc Eye of Gruumsh stats)  
Ten orcs with slightly better gear than normal orcs
   

Will improvise the scene actually facing Grumella, but will be a two stage battle without time even for a short rest between. Really depends on what the situation on the ground looks like and how they tempt Grumella to battle.
 
Homebrew a stronger orc spellcaster as Grumella's main lieutenant, and have that be the boss of the fight.
 
## Aftermath
 
Assuming they win, aftermath will be a series of rewards and treasure
 
**Orcs:**
 
Grumella has a mantle of spell resistance, Blooddrinker greatsword, ring of water walking.  
Grumella's personal treasure horde also contains 1000 gp in various goods and precious metals, as well as four potions of greater healing and six potions of healing (minus whatever was used in combat).
 
**Centaurs:**
 
The centaurs will be pleased with how the battle has gone, but several of their troops have died, including Aris [not necessarily, have Aris arrive in the final battle -- if she dies, she dies, but if the party can save her she'll give Samso the emblem out of gratitude]. The centaurs will want the party to have her emblem.
 
Emblem has three charges. Can use one charge to cast shield, or three charges to fire shield (flame shield only). Can cast either requiring no components.
 
In addition, can store one spell in the emblem. Cast a spell into the emblem, can then until the next dawn cast it without requiring any components.
 
Worn on a chain around neck, can make a chain that is double/triple looped so just unloop when wild shaping. Might not work on things that don't have a neck (giant constrictor snake?), but generally should be fine.
 
Still tweaking exact spells - maybe burning hands as well? Will talk to Sasha.
 
**Town:**
 
The Proconsul will be incredibly happy. Declare the party Heroes of Voltara, tell them they simply have to ask and he will give them what he can -- money, property, magic, training, if he can get it, it is theirs. Marcus Tuso and Galius will support this.
 
Can choose a free feat, a rare or very rare magic item (with DM permission), a significant amount of treasure (like 5000 gp ish), or land in Voltarra.
 
**Dwarves:**
 
Orin Strongaxe will tell them -- hey you know, we've been having some trouble to our south. If you have no obligations here, Brelith, would you bring your friends home to meet your parents and maybe help us out a bit? Take your time to finish up any business here, but don't dawdle too long, I'm afraid something is brewing.
