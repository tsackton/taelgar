# Scenes
 
## Travel to Mountains
 
North over the plains -- improvise, have a decent general sense of the terrain.
 
Roc lives in the far north of the western mountain range, beyond borders of Chardon.
 
## Speaking with Roc
 
Silver Feathers of the Storm Cloud, the Rains and the Thunder -- young and a bit brash. His sister, Silver Talons of the Windstorm, the Grass and Air, is distraught as her egg was stolen from below -- a hole opened up under her nest in the cliffs and the egg was taken by a dao, an elemental creature of earth and spite. She can feel it is still there, somewhere.
 
Play these rocs as young, even though they are old.
 
Switch up roc lore to be more associated with elementals than giants. Can have other "roc variants" that are giant-like if desired.
 
So rocs were created by the elder elementals of air, the elder tempests and the like, in the early days of the world. Many left to the Plane of Air but some remained, enjoying the land below instead of just the open sky. These earthbound rocs often depart for the plane of air later in life, but must lay their eggs in the material plane. So most "elemental rocs" are young.
 
Tend to live solitary lives, with large territories associated with extended family groups, usually siblings as parents will often have departed to the plane of air.

## Finding Clues
 
Rocs can direct party to kobold caves, and will tell them that dao take slaves to work their mines on the plane of earth; have heard rumors the local kobold tribe has been hard hit.
 
If for some crazy reason the party decides to assault the kobold base, reuse maps etc from beginning of air scroll quest.
 
Improvise [[Kobolds]] -- they are wary and a bit nasty. Can be intimidated into revealing information, or bribed,. Appealing to their sense of nobility unlikely to work, as they are currently completely in thrall of the dao, who with ability to move through stone just completely ignores the traps and defenses of their base. Have been bringing slaves to him in exchange for protection, food, treasure.
 
Kobolds feel an attack is risky, very risky, and the current situation is sustainable. Why not just bring the party as slaves, that will buy them a lot of time?
 
Need to be convinced that 1) they, the kobolds, cannot overwhelm the party, and 2) the party can kill the dao, and 3) the party won't just come back and kill the kobolds. Or, need to be bribed with significant wealth, 500 gp or more.
 
As last resort if the party is stuck have the kobolds get together and whisper, and then have one approach, heard rumors that Ghezaran eats gems, if they bring some of that back…..but will require something to seal the bargain, perhaps leaving an item they can live without.
 
In any case, once negotiations finish, kobolds will tell them need to wait for night, and then will lead them as soon as it is full dark to the cliff wall, stopping about 200 yards from tribute area, and point them in the right direction.
 
## Dao Slaver Cave
 
### Area 1: Entry
 
Rocky, dirt area on side of cliff wall, crack in cliff. Two gargoyles perched overlooking entrance, on ledges out above the ground.
 
### Some infrastructure here, a stage/pit area where the dao boss comes to receive tribute.
 
Earth elemental will emerge from the wall.
 
### Area 2: Tunnel
 
The crack curves downward in a tunnel-like structure, looking like it was split open by an earthquake. No encounters, but gets warmer and should feel the thudding pulsing of the portal.
 
About 1000 or 2000 feet in, split in two, one branch left, one branch right.
 
Slave pens left, portal right. From the right there is where the thudding comes.
 
### Area 3a: Slave Pens
 
This is the holding area where slaves are kept before the transit. Currently holds 11 kobolds in four small cells.
 
They are guarded by a single regular earth elemental, and tormented by three magma mephits. The bars of the cells are pure stone, created and removed with the dao's stone shape ability.
 
Cramped, narrow area.

### Area 3b: Portal Room
 
### Large room, circular, the middle is a oozing gray stone that seems to form and reform in an almost nauseating way.
 
Dao is here. Will initially not attack, instead threaten party, tell them "Have you come to offer yourselves as tribute?"
 
If the roc is mentioned will get angry, accuse **Silver Feathers of the Storm Cloud, Thunder and Lightning** and his friends of meddling with things they don't understand. Improv but basic structure here is hinting at some internal conflicts among the genies.
 
If the party doesn't surrender, it will attack. Generally speaking fairly overconfident, but if damaged it will 1) attempt to wall off enough of the party to make an escape with the egg, or as a last resort flee via plane shift or just diving into the portal.
 
The portal is held open by four large silver stones. They are magical, and the portal can be closed if all are destroyed or moved. They resist physical damage, although with a good skill check someone could find a weak point to damage them -- but would need to look for a weak point. Alternatively magic can destroy them (shatter for example).
 
### Area 4a: Treasure Room
 
Set up like a throne room. A large throne, shaped from a single piece of black granite, polished to a fine smooth finish. In front, a table also from a single piece of blue granite. Two chests, but without hinges or doors, made of solid stone. One contains four vials of powdered gems: ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz. Not magical -- dao spice. If creative could sell for a decent amount.
 
The other contains gems and precious metals. About 4 lb of gold (worth 200 gp), 10 lb of silver (worth 500 sp), 4 large garnet (25 gp each), 2 small diamonds (100 gp each), 1 medium ruby (150 gp).
 
### Area 4b: Roc Egg
 
Small circular cave with a very high ceiling, widening above like the bottom of a funnel. Egg itself is about the size of a halfling. Seems to be well-cared-for -- nestled atop a small stone platform with a divet in it, a fire below keeping the stone and the egg warm.
 
Bare rock walls in the rest of the chamber.
 
Egg is non-trivial to carry -- using both hands is safe, but one hand or backpack risks damage. Putting down safely takes a full action, not free object interaction.
 
Next session:  
Finish roc quest, return to rocs. Probably run the slave pens combat as they are leaving, which will be challenge with the egg and as they are worn down.
 
Some roc dialogue, then return to town.
 
At this point will likely still have two weeks until Grumella expected. Let them have downtime, or can make battle plans. Have centaurs, roc, djinni, Galius, local garrison (leader of garrison: Marcus Tuso, a warrior), plus dwarves arriving.
 
Marcus will advise them but they are bringing in tons of allies and need to commit to something.
 
Either next session or the one after will be final battle.
