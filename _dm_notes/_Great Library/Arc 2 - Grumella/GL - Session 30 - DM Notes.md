**Aelar: acquire poisons**
 
Three places to look for poisons or ingredients:

- The outskirts of the open markets outside the city. Requires spending 25 gp and 1 week to search and ask around. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a 10 or less, common poisons (up to 200 gp); on a 11-15, uncommon poisons (up to 500 gp), on a 16-20 rare poisons (up to 1500 gp), very rare poisons only if \>20. Get a +1 to check for each additional 25 gp spent. Can instead buy ingredients.
- Alchemist and other shops in town. No cost to investigate, but only sells ingredients. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a 10 or less, common poisons (up to 200 gp); on a 11-15, uncommon poisons (up to 500 gp), on a 16-20 all poisons. Price for ingredients is between 1/2 and 2/3rds cost of poison, can negotiate. Requires a poisoner's kit check plus a week of downtime to construct a poison from ingredients. Automatic success is value of poison is \<= 20*proficiency bonus. Otherwise, need to roll. If beat DC of poison effect, created as normal. If fail, poison isn't created but ingredients not destroyed. If fail by \>= 10, ingredients are destroyed and characters suffers poison effect.
- Black market. Charisma (Deception) check, and costs 50 gp and 1 workweek. Chance of complications is higher, 20%; use buying a magic item table ([https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem)). However, easier to get rare stuff. On a 8 or less, common posions, on a 11 or less uncommon poisons, on a 14 or less all poisons.

Gains advantage from access to library in Voltara. For each week can substitute a DC 12  
Charisma (Persuasion) check for spending 50 gp, but on a failure need to spend 100 gp to make up for offending the sages.
 
Can also instead use the archives of the Order of Twilight. No cost, but no advantage.
 
Gaining lore is a straight Intelligence check.
 
## Meeting the Proconsul
 
After resolving downtime, inns, shopping, and whatever else they want to do in town, will be summoned by the Proconsul with a messenger and several armed guards who arrive and demand to escort the party to the Proconsul.
 
He will be pacing back and forth, worried, when they arrive.
 
Has received a demand from Grumella. "Turn over the foul creatures that have antagonized me at every turn, or the Moon Skull will turn our wrath on the people of Voltara. The so-called heroes Aglath, Adrik, Aelar, Samso, and Brelith must be brought, unarmed and bound, to the Crystal Chasm Caves north of your town. My emissaries will await your delivery for two weeks. If you do not deliver, our wrath will follow, and blood and death at our hands. This I, Grumella the Vengeful, swear will be done."
 
The proconsul will turn to them:  
"The Great Library clearly sees your value, and the priest Galius Filuso has spoken on your behalf as well. But others would have you condemned to save us from war. I acknowledge your worth to this city, but must look to my people first. What do you have to say for yourselves? What would you have me do?"
 
Let them talk. See what they propose.

## Secrets and Clues
 
- Everyone who travels in the north can tell you the orcs are everywhere. Supposedly looking for old ruins and hidden treasure. It is only a matter of time until they feel powerful enough to attack, especially if they find enough weapons and magic.
- Azzan? You've heard his story? You know, his tomb is hidden in the plains north of here, supposedly his magic helmet is buried with him. He was a great general, Chardon shouldn't have abandoned him. [Or, he was a traitor and fool, he should have come south, no one could have held off the hobgoblins in the great war]
- I don't think these orc scum are much of a threat. If the proconsul wanted to he could send the garrison to destroy them. The fact that he hasn't makes me think he is profiting off these raids somehow.
- Two more chalyte mines were threated. It is only a matter of time before one is attacked. Without our mineral wealth, how long can Voltara prosper?
 
## Fantastic Locations
 
### Tomb of Azzan
 
May hear rumors about this, it is a place where orcs are seeking treasure to help in battle. The hidden tomb of a famous and feared general of the Northlanders, who found against Cha'mutte and his armies during the Great War, and was then betrayed by Chardon.
   

## Backstory Threads
 
**Samso (Lizardfolk disappearance):**
 
1. Doing further research on the sigils you saw in both your village and Iara's village, you come across a text describing the languages of extraplanar realms: Sylvan, the language of the wild and chaotic Feywild; Shadowkar, the language of the dread nightmare realm of the Shadowfell; Abyssal, the demonic tongue of the Abyss; the Primal tongues of the Elemental Planes. The character of the sigils looks like Shadowkar to you.
2. In a faded manuscript text that describes the Shadowkar language, the language of the Shadowfell, you find something that looks like the sigil you found in your homeland. A Shadowkar ruin meaning "crossing over."
3. The Shadowfell is a place of darkness, an echo realm that reflects the material plane but twisting it into apathy, dread, despair and madness. It is rumored to be possible to cross the boundaries of the echo realms, as they are reflections of the real world. But doing so invites madness.
 
(learned above, not below)
 
1. While researching connections between Lizardfolk and the Shadowfell, found in a treatise called "The Various Magicks of the Elder Races", written by a human scholar about 100 years ago: "It is notable that, from what we know and can observe of these non-humans, only the extinct elves and the industrious dwarves seem to have had any special connection to the Arcane. The Lizardfolk, indeed, appear unique in their connection to the Dreamworld, and hence to the mirror realms and echo dimensions that reflect and distort the prime world. Rumors of lizardfolk mystics and prophets hint at the power of this connection, but there is so much we do not know."
2. A story from the far distance past, found while looking for stories of those who have traveled between planes: Once, a mighty hero of the Lizardfolk, a noble solider born in the fall and embodying the might and valor of the Udakena. His family and village was attacked by beings out of nightmares, shadows that took on living form, and taken. Enraged, he followed through a thin place in the world, and fought in a bleak land of grays and blacks. His family escaped, but he fell, fighting to keep the blackness from escaping again into the world of the living. What became of him, no one knows.
3. In "The Annals of Chardon", a series of reports about the growing Empire, you find a strange note, describing the mysterious disappearance of a small lizardfolk settlement on the coast north of Chardon, about 20 years ago. The village stood empty when a group of traders arrived, with no sign beyond a mysterious sigil of what had happened.   
   

**Brelith:**
 
- A letter from Brelith's family:

"To our dear son Brelith,  
News of your exploits has reached us back home. Fighting undead and demons and rescuing temples from evil! And defending the humans from orcs, and hobgoblins, and all manner of deadly beasts as well! Who would of thought our boy could become such a hero! We are proud of you! We are sending you some coin in case you need supplies or anything else. We also heard that you have found some of the ruins of old Dwarven kingdoms of the Deepriver Clan. We have some records from those kingdoms back home if you ever want to visit.  
Love, Mom & Dad"  
(also four small diamonds, each worth 50 gp)

## NPCs
 
**Atius** **Anquercus:** corrupt merchant and influential advisor of the proconsul who has been secretly making money off the threat of war and the raiding, and wants the party dead because they are in his way.
 
## Combat Notes
 
Probably little or no combat this session too. Could have a few wilderness random encounters if they travel somewhere. Should probably make a few options in Roll20/dndbeyond.
 
## Treasure Notes
 
Won't be anything in this session.
