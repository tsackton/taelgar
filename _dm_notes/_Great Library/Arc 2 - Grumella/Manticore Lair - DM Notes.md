## Area 1: Approach
 
The river valley is a lush grassland, with herds of llamas and deer roam, with goats and other species of llamas on the mountain slopes. This is rich hunting for the centaurs, especially as herds move to the lower elevations of the river valley during the winter.
 
Traveling here, describe landscape like Lamar valley, but with herds of deer, few trees, some goats, some lllamas. Predators include wolves, pumas, large foxes. Rare bears.
 
Two manticore spikethrowers patrol the valley. The manticores are not interested in the herds here, strongly preferring human flesh, but they trade meat for prisoners with the orcs, whom they keep in pens and then slaughter. They will also range out and hunt centaurs (although this is dangerous) and occasionally attack shepherds.
 
When the party is spotted, the spikethrowers will attack, starting with spike volleys. They will try for a few rounds to drive the party off, not pursuing if they run, unless they seem wounded and easy to kill. If the party doesn't flee, one will try to Dash out of combat to get back to the lair and warn them, while the other will delay/distract party.
 
If one or both gets away, lair will be on **ALERT** status.
 
**[both defeated; will not be on alert status]**
 
## Area 2: Lair Entrance Climb
 
While the lair entrance is not obvious, there is a poorly marked path leading up in the mountains, used primarily by orcs bringing prisoners to trade. The trail is obvious to spot, but searching/investigating can reveal more information:
 
**Survival**: humanoid, heavily booted tracks, plus lighter soled/barefoot tracks, in a line, perhaps guards + prisoners. Last set from maybe a week ago, guards leaving without prisoners.  
**Investigation**: poorly maintained, but not a natural/animal path, signs of tracks, seems to be used perhaps weekly for coming and going from somewhere up in the mountains  
**Perception**: quiet, no danger on the trail now, feels still [if **ALERT**: sounds of disturbance in the mountains ahead, flapping wings, shouts]
 
Following the path up into the foothills (not high mountains) get to the shaft entrance to the cave complex. Tracks end here. Coiled rope ladder hidden under some rocks (DC 17 to find clues).
 
Drop is about 80'. Rope ladder reaches bottom and is easy way down if they find it.
 
If **ALERT:** whichever of the spikesprayers that survived will be waiting in Area (A), and attack anyone attempted to descend.

## Area A: Entry Chamber and Guards
 
The main entry chamber is dimly lit by the light from the shaft. There is rubble and cracked rock in piles below, from the roof collapse. Water drips from the ceiling/walls and collects in a large, clear pool. Some stalagmites around it.
 
Otherwise, nothing particular to find in this chamber. A refuse heap in the corner contains human and the occasional animal bones.
 
A manticore, along with a hell hound and death dogs, is stationed here to guard the lair from intruders. In general, however, the manticore is lazy and only the hell hound tends to be carefully on alert, so it is possible to surprise them.
 
If **ALERT**, the guards will be waiting to rush out and attack anything that is coming down into the chamber. Otherwise, they are lazily hanging out by the exit.
 
## Area C: Nursery/Hearth
 
This is where the manticore younglings are, along with one den mother. This is also where prisoners are kept awaiting slaughter.
 
There are six crude wooden pens on the far wall, two of which currently have people in them.
 
**Maneo** and **Sera** are husband-and-wife shepherds who tend to goats on the plains northeast of Voltara. They were captured by orcs two weeks ago, and bought here about four days ago. Two days before, they watched two other prisoners slaughtered and fed to the manticores, especially the younglings, and the manticore den mother has been taunting them for days, saying they are almost ready to eat. They have very little, but will be eternally grateful if rescued and promise the party what little reward they can afford if they get home.
 
The ceilings here are only about 15', so generally the manticore younglings and manticore den mother won't be able to take off and fly. Will fight to the death, as what other choice do they have? To cruel/stupid to beg for mercy.
 
## Area D: Main Chamber
 
If the guard battle takes more than 2 rounds, or if spikesprayers got away, this room will be on **ALERT**.
 
This is a large chamber, the most notable feature being a large whitish flowstone on the far wall, an impressive cave feature that is reminiscent of spikes. [see here: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Saracen%27s_Tent%2C_Luray_Caverns.jpg/1920px-Saracen%27s_Tent%2C_Luray_Caverns.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Saracen%27s_Tent%2C_Luray_Caverns.jpg/1920px-Saracen%27s_Tent%2C_Luray_Caverns.jpg)]
 
The ceilings are 50' here, pretty high.
 
A clear area in front of the flowstone forms the main area of the pack leader. I figure manticores are a bit like lions, they tend to just lie around when not hunting or eating. Perhaps playing a game of insults or something. If the party is sneaking, they can hear this game going on, perhaps.
 
If **ALERT**, the three regular manticores will fly up and hide on perches on the walls, and the pack leader will wait and demand surrender of anyone coming this way. If they refuse, will attack with the manticores above having a chance of getting surprise.
 
## Area E: Sleeping Area/Nest
 
Manticores care little for treasure, but do make nests, and will sometimes incorporate scraps from their meals into their nests.
