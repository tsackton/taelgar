A lizardfolk druid, from the area south of Chardon.
 
Left his village when everyone mysteriously vanished.
 
## Backstory
 
You were born in a small Lizardfolk village hidden in the forest along the great Yeraad river, flowing from the \<CentralMoutains\> to the sea. As a young lizardling you liked nothing more than exploring the woods and streams of your home, and as you grew you spent more and more time learning the paths and thoughts of the plants and animals in your home.
 
One year, returning to your village after exploring for several days, you were shocked to find your home gone, and a black rot clinging to the trees and polluting the streams. Everybody you knew and loved was gone. The only clue left behind was a shimmering green sigil on the ground, that slowly faded as you watched.
 
Distraught, and overcome, you turned to the woods, living in seclusion as you helped the forest heal from whatever had happened. While you were in the seclusion in the woods of your home, with no one to talk to, you learned to listen to the feeling of the animals and plants around you, able to extend your senses catch glimpses of the feelings of the natural world around you.
 
After many years with no sign of your family, and nothing but silence from the spirits of your ancestors, you decided you needed to venture out in the wider world learn what had happened, and you headed for Chardon. There, you learned that the Great Library was seeking adventurers to help recover lost artifacts and forgotten magic, and the learned sages of the Library seemed like your best option for clues. So you decided to join them and see what you could learn.
