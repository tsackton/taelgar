## Backstory
 
You grew up the third son of a rich and powerful Dwarven family, in the city of gems, Zarkandur, in the dwarven kingdom of Am'kazhar. Your childhood was uneventful, full of study of history and religion. This was too quiet and boring for you, and you were constantly pushing to do something exciting. After reaching adulthood, and discovering your connection to the Bahrazel, you decided to leave home to seek adventure and glory in the name of the Bahrazel.
 
While on the road, you met an itinerant priest of the Wildling, whom you traveled with for several years and who helped you discover how to channel the power of the storm using your connection to the Bahrazel.
 
During your travels, you were attacked by bandits on the road, and your quick thinking and timely Thunderwave saved the priests' life. As a token of his thanks, he gave you a holy symbol of the Wildling, which you can take to a Wildling Temple and exchange for healing.
 
Spurred by this encounter to seek greater glories, the old priest told you that the Great Library in Chardon was seeking adventurers and treasure-seekers to help recover ancient artifacts and knowledge of a lost age. And so you headed towards Chardon, riches, and glory!
