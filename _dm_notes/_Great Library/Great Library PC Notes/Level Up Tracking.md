(this is when Isaac and Sasha level up; others sometimes a bit behind)
 
Level 2: After Fire Scroll (Session 1)ï¿¼Level 3: After Pietravola Abby (Session 3)  
Level 4: After Dwarven Vault (Session 6)  
Level 5: During/After Restoring the Temple Quest (Session 12 or so)  
Level 6: During Air Scroll (Session 24 or so)  
Level 7: After Manticore Lair (Session 33)
 
---- targets (aiming for 8-12 sessions per level) ----
 
Level 8: Session 41-45, which would be 3-7 sessions after final battle; this should be reasonable for the end of the hag quest. Need 7210 XP from now. Give 3-4k for Grumella battle, then will need ~3k. Get 1000 each hag session, leading up to final hag award pushing them well over the top to level 8.
 
Level 9: 51-55 roughly. Depending on how much the hag finale pushes them past level 8 threshold, this would either be on way back to Voltara (after lizardfolk quest), or after some around-Voltara exploration. In any case, shouldn't get message from Lyra until they are level 9.
 
Level 10: Lost Laboratory quest should take them from level 9 to level 10.
 
Level 11: After Lost Laboratory, will head to Chardon. Should depart Voltara level 10, arrive Chardon level 11.
 
After this gets a bit hazy, but the idea will be to get them to level 13 via 2nd lizardfolk quest, Chardon one-shots, etc.
 
Once at level 13, unlocking plane shift, can really start lizardfolk quest.
 
After that, just see what happens.
