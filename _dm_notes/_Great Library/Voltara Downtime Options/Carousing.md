In general, follow rules on XGtE p. 126-128, with these modifications:
 
- Outside the city in the merchant area of town, you can carouse with lower classes or middle classes, but not upper classes.
- Characters with access to the walled city have the option of also carousing with the upper class, as long as they can find a way to fit in.
 
Reputation:
 
- A very low roll or a triggered complication may get you a reputation as a partier; Archivist Lyra will look down on these characters but won't affect contracts.
