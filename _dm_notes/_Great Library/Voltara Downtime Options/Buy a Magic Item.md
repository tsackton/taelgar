In general, follow rules on XGtE p. 126, with these modifications:
 
- Trying to find a magic item to buy outside the walled city is possible, but difficult. Players start with a -5 to the check (minimum 1), and cannot get a total check greater than 20.
- Specific items that are common, uncommon, or rare can be found, but anything higher will be impossible.

- Attempting to buy a magic item has little effect on reputation, although if it gets around that a character is searching, may attract interest from ==Secret Master Galius or others in the Great Library. In general the Proconsul won't care much about this.==
