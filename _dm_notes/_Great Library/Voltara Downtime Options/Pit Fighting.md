For unofficial battles, DC of checks is 5 + 2d10, and follows standard Volo's rules (5 + 2d10 DC) but with rewards of 25, 50, and 75 gp for winning 1, 2, or 3 battles. Winning all 3 battles multiple times builds a reputation. Chance of a complication is 15% per week.
 
Official battles require entering the lists to compete in the Voltara Ampitheater. Running win/loss records determine challenge and also rewards. Must win 3 bouts to be ranked. Unranked ("open") bouts are DC 8 + 2d10, and each win awards 40 gp.
 
Once ranked, bouts award 50 gp until top tiers. Moving up ranks is haphazard, but depends on overall W/L record since entering ranks, strength of victory, and "flash." At least 3 'intermediate' ranks before the elite ranks.
