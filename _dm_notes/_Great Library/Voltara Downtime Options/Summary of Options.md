## Buy a Magic Item
 
You attempt to find magic items for sale, either a particular item or a selection. If you don't have access to the walled city, this will be harder. In general, magic items are quite expensive, costing hundreds of gold for an uncommon item and thousands for a rare item. More powerful items are rarely available for sale.
 
## Carousing
 
You eat, drink, and socialize in taverns and inns, with a chance to make a contact or three within the social class you socialize with. Unless you have access to the walled city, you can only carouse with the lower or middle classes. Costs depend on the social status of the individuals you are socializing with.
 
## Crafting
 
You attempt to craft a mundane or magical item, or brew a potion. This requires proficiency in the relevant tools, and a workspace appropriate to the task. Access to the walled city, or contact with an appropriate artisan, is generally required to craft anything more complicated than a potion. Crafting magic items is a regulated activity.
 
## Crime
 
You join with the local underworld to commit crimes. While this can be lucrative, if you are caught your reputation will suffer tremendously and the Great Library will likely kick you out. The risks and the rewards are higher if you attempt criminal activity in the walled city.
 
## Gambling
 
Gambling is a common activity in the merchant taverns outside the walls. The maximum stake you can wager is 250 gp. To bet more, you need access to upper class society inside the walls.
 
## Pit Fighting
 
Merchants love to gamble on brawls which happen in a few of the bigger inns outside of town. You may enter the lists to fight in these matches; your winnings are 25 gp, 50 gp, and 100 gp for 1, 2, or 3 successes. If you have access to the walled city, you can enter matches at the arena, with twice the winnings, but DC equal to 8 + 2d10 for each check.
 
## Relaxation
 
You rest and relax at the inn, helping yourself heal from ongoing diseases, poisons, or other non-magical effects. If you spend a full week relaxing, you gain 1 extra Hit Die beyond your normal maximum, which you can expend as normal.
 
## Religious Service
 
Outside the walls, there are small shrines to the Traveler, mostly, as well as small shrines to the gods of the dwarves and halflings. While you may perform religious services here, the maximum possible result is 1 favor. Inside the walls, there is more diversity of religious options, and you can earn up to 2 favors.
 
## Research
 
You cannot research unless you have access to the walled city. If you do, follow the normal rules for research.
 
## Seek out Rumors
 
You eat, drink, and socialize in taverns and inns, with a goal of picking up rumors. Follow the rules for carousing, but instead of contacts you have a chance to pick up rumors.
 
## Scroll Scribing
 
Scribing spell scrolls is a regulated activity in Voltara. If you do not have permission from the appropriate authorities, you must also make an ability check to avoid detection. Being detected results in a fine, and a negative reputation, although will probably not risk expulsion from the library (depending on the scroll you are scribing).
 
## Selling a Magic Item
 
This can be attempted anywhere, but will be harder outside the walls.
 
## Training
 
What you can train will depend on access to an instructor. Many languages can be learned outside the walls (10 weeks downtime each, minus a number of weeks equal to Intelligence mod). However most tools, skills, weapons, and armor would require access to the walled city.
