You join with the local underworld to commit crimes. While this can be lucrative, if you are caught your reputation will suffer tremendously and the Great Library will likely kick you out. The risks and the rewards are higher if you attempt criminal activity in the walled city.
 
You may only attempt DC 10 or 15 robberies outside the walls.
 
Inside the walls, failing 2 or 3 checks will get you caught. Outside the walls, failing 3 checks will get you caught, but failing 2 checks will mean you were spotted.
 
Getting caught guarantees expulsion from the library; getting spotted makes it likely, but not definite.
