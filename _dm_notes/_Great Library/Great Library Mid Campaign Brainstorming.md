Eventually need to bring in hag coven searching for him  
Pit fighting -- flesh out leagues; he is now in the highest of the "amateur leagues" outside the city

Other characters:  
Brelith -- no real backstory hooks of note, but maybe work on something with the Dwarven kingdom he is from? Or the mentor who helped him?
 
Aglath - from far away, and doesn't play super regularly so probably not worth investing time?
 
Aelor - monastery where he trained needs fleshing out, who were these people? Also, how did an Elf end up living alone in a city, and which city? The Chardon of 250 years ago?
 
Scordith - betrayer cult worth fleshing out but doesn't play regularly enough to really invest in

Plot threads:
 
1. Great Library, quest for the scrolls:
    1. Right now, Lyra has three of the four scrolls but the location of the fourth scroll is a mystery. A messenger from Chardon will be coming with clues; maybe make this an actual puzzle? But next step is that the messenger will be captured and ransomed by the goblins in the hills, who also need money to pay off the emerging orc/hobgoblin alliance.
    2. At start of session 10, Lyra will have left a message for the party to alert her at once when they return, rather angry they disappeared without notifying her. "Do you work for me, or not?" But she will be sympathetic when she learns that the party was helping lizardfolk, especially when she learns of their plight, and will wax rhapsodic about the plight of the Dunmari.
    3. When they meet, she will tell them that a messenger is expected from Chardon in the next two weeks, with more information that may lead to the location of the Scroll of Endless Wind. She will warn them not to stray.
    4. In ~2-3 weeks, she will get worried that the messenger has not arrived; this will coincide with an increase in requests to the Proconsul to ransom citizens of Voltara and a heating up of the orc raids; party should be half way to 5th level at least, and gaining a local reputation, and so will be summoned by the Proconsul.
    5. Will lead (hopefully) to them seeking out the source of kidnappings and thus finding the messenger, alive, or at least finding the message. If they don't take the bait, then eventually Lyra will receive a direct request for ransom, and/or will send them directly to look for the missing messenger. This is a bit loose but somehow they will need to search for the messenger. If they still don't succeed, will need to infiltrate goblin stronghold and track down where the clues when.
    6. Once they find the last clue to the air scroll, need to decipher. This will either be an actual puzzle they need to work on, or will be a deciphered clue to location
    7. Location is a multi-part adventure: trek into mountains, cave, endless stair, glacier, floating castle/tower. Everyone should be 5th level middle of adventure. Plan for ~3-4 sessions.
    8. Once they find the air scroll, will need to decide what happens next -- could transition to orc wars, or develop another set of quests building off the scrolls, or the scrolls together could point to a lost artifact of some kind
 
1. The Temple of the Order of the Twilight:
    1. Session 9 started 4 days after the centaurs; during session 9 they traveled 5 days west, spend 1 day fighting, and traveled 5 days back to Voltara, so it is now 16 days since the centaurs (at the start of session 10).
    2. Backstory: the Order of Twilight was a monastic order of healers and hospice care associated with the Night Queen. They were particularly prevalent in Amani, and were thus heavily impacted by the Blood Years. However, a few small pockets of members survived and the Order is now growing again. [Galius Filuso](Galius%20Filuso.md) has been scouting, recruiting, and looking for lost Order sites in the North for a while.
    3. Xameia the Forsworn will not be satisfied until restitution is made for her sins. There are a bunch of options for this:
        1. If the party donates 2,000 gp to [[Galius Filuso]], or to the Night Queen, making it clear this is to help restore the Order of Twilight, Xameia can rest
        2. If they find the desecrated monastery of the Order of Twilight which was the scene of the demon battle, clear the demons, and pay for the casting of a Hallow spell (1000 gp material components, 300 gp donation to a priest to cast it), that will also satisfy Xameia and let her rest.
        3. If they make a donation to the Night Queen / [[Galius Filuso]] but it isn't 2000 gp, may add a quest in addition
        4. They could come up with something else, but in general should cost between 1000 and 2000 gp, with amounts on the lower end resulting in also needing some kind of quest / task
    4. If they don't complete this in 30 days, they will start to have nightmares of Xameia. Get about a week of leeway where the only real penalty is loss of downtime, then escalate. Next week is Wisdom saving throws to avoid exhaustion, and the following week Xameia appears to fight them.
    5. Once this is complete, they will have gained an ally in [[Galius Filuso]] and the priests of the Night Queen / Order of Twilight, who can speak on their behalf with the Proconsul.
 
1. Orc raids
    1. Grumella the Vengeful, clan leader of the Moon Skull clan, suffered a defeat when her champion Raluhk the Orog, who had been leading the raids towards Voltara, was defeated. However, some orcs escaped, and reported to her the strange party that defeated Raluhk: a goliath, three dwarfs, and a lizardfolk.
    2. In the past few weeks, she has however consolidated her gains in the western mountains: she has made alliance with the hobgoblins (very unusual for orcs), and they have been pressuring the goblins and kobolds in the lower mountains to step up raids on the west road. This has made up for some shortfalls in treasure from the Voltara region. The goblins are being unusually smart and focusing on kidnapping messengers and other fast travelers, and demanding ransom. They are also instigating tolls on the road. This has been a steady thorn in the side of the Proconsul and the library and will come into play with the messenger plot thread. Try to drop some rumors in the next session or two, though.
    3. Long term goals of Moon Skull clan are to expand south, conquering and raiding the fertile land south of Voltara, and living fat on the herds of livestock there. The city of Voltara is a major problem, and so they have made alliance with hobgoblins to let the hobgolbins conqueror the city and control the chalyte trade, so the orcs can plunder the soft underbelly south. Maybe need to flesh this out a little, think through the motives of various parties.
    4. Assuming the party also thwarts the goblin raiders in the west, they will come to the attention of Grumella and she will turn her focus on them. The Proconsul is not foolish enough to make deals with orcs, but will seriously consider turning the party in to buy time to build defenses.
    5. Basically, this plot line should be a growing thorn in the parties' side, popping up every now and then to inconvenience them. They should be hearing rumors about the Moon Skull clan and Grumella.
    6. At some point they may decide to lead an attack. Possible allies could include centaurs, Quintus and his merchant friends, the Order of Twilight, the Great Library, and depending on what they do / how they play their cards, Lizardfolk and the Proconsul / Voltarran establishment, and possibly depending on future events the miner's guild.
    7. Some complications to throw at them:
        1. Attack on a Chalyte mine, perhaps brought to their attention by mine captain they rescued
        2. Emissary of Grumella demanding the party be turned over to her or attacks will increase
        3. Orc raiders seeking treasure in Voltarra area (drop clues re: places to find old abandoned gold?)
        4. Other random adventures that seem relevant from various sources, a good way to throw something in if I don't have anything planned
 
1. Lizardfolk curse
    1. The events in the village to the west, and the events in Samso's homeland, are connected. This should be a slow burning plot thread, though.
    2. Iara can be a recurring character, when I want to update this plot thread she can send a message or come find Samso
    3. Should be some clues Samso can stumble upon in various contexts:
        1. The sigil in his homeland, and the sigil in the village to the west, are both runes in the same ancient script
        2. The lizardfolk firstborn, and/or Kyr, are involved somehow
        3. The shadow lizardfolk are connected to the Shadowfell; perhaps there are other signs of Shadowfell infiltration; connects to Cinder Queen plotline?
        4. There needs to be a reason lizardfolk are targeted first, something about their connection to their ancestors and the Dreamworld
        5. Introduce clues relating to the Dreamworld / astral projection
        6. Halflings may also start being targeted - drop some rumors about a sickness or plague spreading among halflings, some kind of wasting disease, perhaps modeled a bit on grayscale from Game of Thrones
        7. Need to drop some clues indicating that the missing Lizardfolk are alive, somewhere
        8. Perhaps relating to plane shifting? But need to be a lot higher level for at-will planar travel (13th level for plane shift) -- so this will have to be a really slow burn plot thread
 
1. Other plot threads to introduce:
    1. Adrik - hag subplot, additional backstory (treasure map?)
    2. Something to set up whatever the next thread after the elemental scrolls is going to be
    3.   
        
 
**Where we are, 11/22:**
 
1. Orc plot thread. Grumella will be angry, and proconsul will want help. Orcs demanding that party be turned over to Grumella, proconsul will summon them to demand help in exchange for not doing this? Ties into corrupt official who may become a rival in Voltara.
2. Lizardfolk plot thread: Drop some clues with next downtime research, but should be long-term stuff
3. Hag plot thread: hag has been driven north by Agata; will eventually threaten Brelith's home and tie into Adrik's backstory
4. Great Library: next great library adventure will be lost library of kwalish, I think.
5. Other: the Dwarven pit is looming waiting for them
 
Basic order:
 
Orcs are most immediate threat, and this will hopefully be 3-4 sessions at least and take them into level 7. After defeating the orcs, will really establish their reputations in Voltara especially, but also more generally in the north.
 
At this point, hopefully there will still be a month or so before Lyra is expected back in Voltara with news and more quests. Will be a perfect opportunity for the dwarven pits. This could take them to level 8.
 
Then, have hag plotline and next great library adventure taking them to level 9/10? Here they will start to explore more widely and travel more beyond Voltara. This would be the time to have them return to Brelith's home. For hag quest, need to introduce two things: first, message from Brelith's family that they know he is getting strong and they are proud of him; second, rumors from the south about lack of news from some frontier area.
 
**Where we are, 3/23:**
 
The orc plot thread is wrapping up, with the final battle with Grumella upcoming. Assuming they win, have some loose ends to tackle. (If they lose, launch into a whole against-the-orcs plotline, escaping from camp, etc).
 
Adrik's hag backstory  
Samso's mysterious lizardfolk disappearance / Shadowfell story  
Hints of some elemental planes war upcoming  
Next phase of Chardon mission
 
Probably going to switch to using modified published material for a bit.
 
Some notes / ideas:
 
_Hag backstory_
 
Will hear from Orin Strongaxe about trouble to the south, refugees fleeing something, etc. Nothing has threatened Brelith's home, but they are obviously strong and powerful, and if they were interested Brelith's family would certainly be happy to have their help investigating.
 
_Basic outline_
 
Travel to Brelith's home; meet with NPCs; travel south and gather rumors of destruction; uncover hag is behind this; learn it is the hag from Adrik's backstory; kill it
 
Most of this would be pretty easy to homebrew; consider a published module piece for the hag's lag. Ideas including:
 
DotMM: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdotmm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdotmm) maybe steal pieces from different levels? Would require a lot of modificiation.
 
Chapter 5 of Rime of the Frost maiden could be adapted to a nice hag lair, or Chapter 6: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/aurils-abode) or [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/caves-of-hunger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/caves-of-hunger)
 
Vale of Dancing Waters from PotA could work with monster changes, good map: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/pota/alarums-and-excursions#ValeofDancingWaters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/pota/alarums-and-excursions#ValeofDancingWaters)
 
Similarly, Rundreth Manor could work: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/pota/alarums-and-excursions#RundrethManor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/pota/alarums-and-excursions#RundrethManor)
 
_Lizardfolk backstory_
 
This involves traveling to the Shadowfell, so needs to wait until higher level (13th or so).
 
Basic structure:
 
- First, a one-shot that involves another attack on a lizardfolk village, where a link to the Shadowfell and the fact that the lizardfolk are being taken captive is clearly established.
    - Could use Blood Palace or Ithrix Blackbile from Book of Lairs
    - Or, Tammeraut's Fate from Ghosts of Saltmarsh
        - [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/gos/tammerauts-fate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/gos/tammerauts-fate)
    - Book of Cylinders from Candlekeep Adventures?
        - [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cm/book-of-cylinders#BookofCylinders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cm/book-of-cylinders#BookofCylinders)
 
- Second, a one-shot that leads to a way to stop the attacks, but leaves those who were taken trapped in the Shadowfell
    - This could also be Tammeraut's Fate
    - Chapter 12 of Rise of Tiamat?
        - [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/rot/death-to-the-wyrmspeakers#Chapter12Neronvain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/rot/death-to-the-wyrmspeakers#Chapter12Neronvain)
    - Could look for other stuff…depends on level
 
- Finally, a campaign arc that involves going to the Shadowfell, figuring out why the lizardfolk were being taken, rescuing them, and defeating the evil plans of the boss.
    - This needs to be homebrew, obviously
 
_Elemental Wars_
 
This really is all homebrew, but keep hinting at it. Zadkhai could return in a one-shot, angry and bearing a message. Rerun a random encounter with a dao or have some efreeti pop up. Play with it. If we make it to like level 15+, this will be the final campaign arc most likely.
 
_Great Library Mission_
 
At some point, will get a message from Archivist Lyra; she is stuck in Chardon, but wants them to retrieve XXX, and escort it safely to Chardon.
 
Run Lost Laboratory of Kwalish.
 
Could also consider:

- PotA dungeons (tying into Elemental Wars)
- Book of Lairs
 
Ultimately goal is to have them travel to Chardon, and have some Chardon adventures -- this should aid in resolution of lizardfolk quest, perhaps also cross-over with Dunmar campaign.
 
This should also give a bit of time for more random dungeons / adventures on the road, including the dwarven pit adventure (look at DotMM to find a good level to use for this; also look at Book of Lairs and browse through OofA to see if anything viable. Also consider some mind flayer stuff here?
 
**Book of Lairs ideas**
 
Ithrix Blackbile (7th level) - black dragon and trolls in a swamp ruin  
The Blood Palace (8th level) - spirit naga and gnolls in a swamp ruin  
Curse of Black Ice (8th level) - werewolf frost giant and werewolves in an ice ruin
 
## Summary
 
So, planning ahead. Next arc is Trouble with Dwarves. Travel to mountains, investigate, defeat hag. On return to Voltara, perhaps another lizardfolk village encounter. Reach level 8, maybe level 9 before returning to Voltara.
 
Back in Voltara, some free time to explore. Maybe dig into dwarven mine ruins, maybe poke around other ruins opened up by orc defeat. Could be a good opportunity to foreshadow some
 
Once they are out of ideas / have nothing more to do in Voltara, message from Archivist Lyra arrives with details about the next mission, probably something like Lost Laboratory of Kwalish, which they need to find something and bring it back to Chardon. This should take them to level 10.
 
On route to Chardon, run second lizardfolk one-shot. This should set up research in Chardon about ways to get to the Shadowfell and deal with the threat. Probably aiming to be level 11 or 12 when they reach Chardon.
 
Again, have an opportunity for a few one-shots, etc. Once they hit level 13, launch into Shadowfell quest in earnest.
 
After Shadowfell quest is finished and lizardfolk are freed, have another break. Whatever, this doesn’t need to be plotted out now.
 
Final arc would be Elemental Wars, taking them to level 20.
