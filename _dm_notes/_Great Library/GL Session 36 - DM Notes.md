Return to town, war council.

Scenes:

1. Journey back to Voltara. It is kind of far -- they did this in one day with wind walk, but it is actually hundreds of miles.
2. Battle council -- meet, make a plan.

Actual battle will be the next session, I think.

So, detailing:

## Journey to Voltara:

It is about 300 miles back to Voltara.

The terrain is pretty easy to navigate, but still limited by travel pace.

Fast pace = 30 miles per day (so 10 days); normal pace = 24 miles per day (12 1/2 days); slow pace = 18 miles per day (so about 17 days).

Can push themselves to go faster (forced march), but risk exhaustion:

Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion).

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion).

A forced march at a fast pace adds 4 miles per extra hour; 3 at a normal pace.

If they want to craft a boat, the river would be marginally faster and would let them drift 24 hours a day if desired, although sleeping in improvised boats could be miserable.

Run this as a problem-solving exercise if they want to go faster, or just a 10 day montage if they eat the time. That would put them back at day 17, so they'd still have 3-4 days minimum to plan, but not a lot of time.

## Battle Council

The Proconsul has turned the defense of the city to Marcus Tuso, the general of the Voltara guard.

People involved:

The Voltara Guard, which is roughly 800 warriors permanently stationed in and around Voltara, plus an additional levy of 1000 light infantry and irregulars recently recruited. Within the Guard is one unit of mages, none high level. Commander: Marcus Tuso

The centaurs, numbering about 50 strong calvary. Commander: Aris, a young but strong and brash female warrior

The dwarven guard, just arrived, numbering 400 soldiers, led by Orin Strongaxe, an older cousin of Brelith's and a seasoned commander.

Galius Filuso, representing the Order of Twilight and speaking for the Mos Numena establishment. He is the

Meerengesha of Sumana, the Djinni

Silver Feathers of the Storm Cloud, Thunder and Lightning, the roc

--------

A large force of Chardonians is marching north -- a total of 5,000 troops. But they will not arrive until day 36 at the earliest, and probably not until day 40+.

---------

Aris and Orin tend to stay in the background, although Orin is an experienced commander and can function kind of like the voice of the DM. Marcus is defensive oriented and will prefer low-risk, safer strategies.

--------

The strength of Grumella's Horde is not known, but early estimates place it between 1k - 5k orcs and allies. Scouting can help refine these estimates.

------

Grumella will suspect her bargain has not been met on day 16, and begin planning retaliation on day 18. She will scout and try to get a sense of the lay of the land before launching an all out assault.

Scouts will explore the Voltara area around day 20 - 23 and return to Grumella's camp by day 26.

On Day 27, she will march.

By Day 31, her army will be at Voltara.

[advanced this timeline]

-----

Grumella's army consists of 3000+ orcs, plus manticores, hill giants, and ogres.

Without a good strategy, Voltara will be hard-pressed to win.

If the party can defeat the hill giants, that will even things up considerably.

------

Plan: party will kill hill giants while centaur, roc, and dwarves deal with ogres and make sure the orcs don't bother the party.

Djinni: will summon a huge wind and rain storm to protect the city and keep the manitcores grounded.

Human army will defend the walls.

FOR NEXT TIME:

Make 3 waves of combat:

- The hill giant battle, which should be damaging but not particularly hard (3 hill giants)
- An orc guard around Grumella, which should be medium
- Grumella and her immediate lieutenants
