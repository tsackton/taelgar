Old fortified village / castle, probably associated with some religious order (FIGURE OUT, could be Order of Twilight).
 
Only two buildings still standing are the stone keep (missing its roof now, main hoard) and about 200' away, the chapel. Dragon treasure is split, usually watches from chapel. Acid pool in center of keep. Oozes to keep people from climbing tower wall and keep wall.
