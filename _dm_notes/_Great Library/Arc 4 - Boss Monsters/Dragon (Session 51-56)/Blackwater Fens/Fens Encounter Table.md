**Traveling in the Fens:**
 
Use map, and use tension dice. Ask which way they are going, and roll dice for encounters during the day/night, after resolving checks for travel.
 
If a patrol finds them and gets away, or anything else tips Nymthrax to their presence, he will try to keep them from resting, especially if they are within 6 miles of the lair where the main regional effects occur. This could involve dive-by attacks until they force him to flee, or waves of minions, or something else.
 
Be creative - but the main idea here should be that once they are spotted once, long rests are impossible within 20 miles of the lair, and reinforcements will make it harder to attack again if they retreat to rest.

|2|Pick a patrol, add a some additional bad guys|
|3|Pick a trap, add a patrol|
|4|A swampy clearing in which two dead trees grow. They are both Yggdrasti, and will attack anything within reach.|
|5|Corpse flower, with a swarm of zombie limbs. Creates regular zombies, husk zombie bursters, or beast zombies [use anklyosaurus zombie stat block, or take regular beast, double HP, reduce AC to 9, and give undead fortitude]|
|6|Venom troll and four troglodytes on patrol. Venom troll makes a morale check each time it takes fire or acid damage while below 50% health (Wis saving throw, DC 12, on a failure dashes to escape). Troglodytes automatically flee when troll flees, but not before. (*)|
|7|2d4 will-'o-wisps attempt to lure intruders to an area where an assassin vine is waiting, climbing along a ruin. Fight to the death.|
|8|Six mantraps lure intruders to their doom.|
|9|Nymthrax fly-by; will flee if reduced to fewer than 70% of hit points, preferring to fight in lair.|
|10|Bugbear patrol: a bugbear chief, four bugbears, and two ogre chain brutes. All have acid scars on their face, and chain brute attacks do an additional 2d4 acid damage on hit. Each chain brute has two bugbear handlers. Whenever anyone dies, everyone left must make a DC 10 Morale check (at disadvantage if the chief dies; chain brutes are at disadvantage if both handlers are dead). Bugbears flee on failure; chain brutes go berserk, gaining advantage on attacks but attacking at random. (*)|
|11|Two shambling mounds attack. Engulfed creatures take an additional 2d4 acid damage at the start of each of their turns. Fight to the death.|
|12|Pack of ghouls attacks: 4d4 ghouls, 1d4 ghasts. Will attack to the death. If a creature falls to 0 hp, ghoul will drag it away, and other ghouls will attack that ghoul to try to steal food.|
|13|Nymthrax fly-by: will not attack, just scouting. Turns on long-rest-prevention mechanism.|
|14|Field of tri-flower fronds, with the additional false form characteristic, they look just like the usual dismal swamp vegetation (or at least don't look alive)|
|15|Animated breath (acid) patrol. One will immediately flee to warn Nymthrax; the other will sacrifice itself to ensure its companion gets away.|
|16|A small ruin, what was perhaps once a small chapel or village temple, but has been almost entirely swallowed by the swamp. Inside, two wraiths (one perhaps buffed with Forbidden Lairs / Ithryx wraith stats]|
|17|A gray standing stone, use [The Harmony Stone](Gazetteer/Greater%20Chardon/Chardonian%20Empire/Chasa%20River%20Valley/Chasa%20River%20Valley.md) as background, halfway sunken and tipping over. If it is righted, will feel sense of peace, see the area as it once was. Safe place to long rest if fixed. Might add some weak enemies|
|18|The top of what was once a castle sticking out of the ground. The area around it functions as quicksand, but if they can get past the quicksand and dig underground, it is a safe place to long rest. Some oozes hang out in quicksand, need to be killed first [|
|19|pick one of 16-18, the wraith lair is safe to rest once killed|
|20|A small chapel, amazing still intact, blessed by the night queen. Under effects of a _Hallow_ spell, and a safe place to long rest.|
   

No fixed encounters outside the lair area, but the 6 mile radius circle around the lair has the following:
 
1. Troglodyte "village"
2. Ooze pit
3. Carnivorous plant farm
 
The lair itself is adapted from the lair in FTD, with the following traps/additions:
 
- Bugbear allies/minions, perhaps with ogres chained up
- Clay golem defender blocking hidden entrance / passage
- Hidden ooze puddles
- Acid pits/acid spray
