## The Dragon
 
Nymthrax the Befouler, Lord of Blackwater, King of Rot, and Master of Ruin, is an adult black dragon, approaching 500 years old. He was born in the [[Blackwater Fens]] when they were a small, much more pleasant and inhabited swamp. He fought, and was deeply wounded, in the Great War, and retreated to his newfound lair to recover. Over the past 100 years, as he has slowly amassed treasure from the lost kingdoms destroyed in the Great War, and even older relics, his power has grown, and now he seeks revenge, to watch the downfall of Chardon and all it stands, watch it retreat to lick its wounds and then rip the last shreds of the Empire to pieces, claiming the best of its treasures for himself and leaving the rest to rot.
 
He is endlessly patient, and having dealt with the bullywugs, the orcs, and some Deno'qai he is biding his time, hoarding his treasure, and amassing servants to eventually take on Voltara, the rest of the Deno'qai, and finally the Chardonian empire.
 
He drives any who will not serve him out of his territory, leaving a dismal wasteland of thralls and mindless beasts, filled with the rotting remains of past kingdoms.
 
**Description:** standard black dragon, but has a massive scar running along the entire side of one wing, reducing the saving throw of his Wing Attack to DC 16, and reducing his flying speed to 60 ft.
 
## Minions
 
Nymthrax does not allow any creature that will not serve him to live within 100 miles of his lair, and he regularly patrols this area, attacking creatures he does not recognize (although is less likely to patrol the areas to the south that abut Deno'qai territory).
 
This is effectively the entire area of the [[Blackwater Fens]], plus some of the adjacent woods to the east/southeast and the scrub/hills to the west/southwest.
 
So the fens are unnaturally devoid of life for this reason, with obvious scars and signs of Nymthrax's attack: acid scarred pits, pools of acid, destroyed bullywug villages, destroyed orc camps, etc [although orcs are to west/southwest so party won't encounter; they will probably encounter bullywug villages].
 
What is left are his servants and the oozes, undead, and plant creatures that he relies on.
