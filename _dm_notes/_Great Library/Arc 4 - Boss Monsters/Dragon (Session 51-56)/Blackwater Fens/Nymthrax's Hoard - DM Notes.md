Nymthrax is obssessed with history, and lost magic in particular. He has gathered a hoard primarily comprised of ancient treasures, with newer stuff, especially collected from bullywugs, orcs, and hobgoblins, tossed aside somewhat more carelessly than the rest of the hoard.
 
Nymthrax keeps his hoard well-hidden in two places. At the top of the chapel tower, much of the modern day wealth and trade goods are piled and organized, but none of the prize possessions of the hoard are here.
 
For the historical relics and ancient treasures that are Nymthrax's true pride, one must swim a 200' twisting underground tunnel filled with water, emerging in an acid pool in the middle of an old keep, where his historical treasure is laid out in chronological order, carefully displayed.
 
## Traps
 
The ruined tower is coated with dripping ooze. While ascending, take acid damage and pseudopods attack.
 
The keep has an acid pool in the center of it, 4d4 acid damage per round spent in the acid.
 
## Tower Hoard
 
A small pile of Chardonian coins, mostly silver. About 100,000 silver pieces and 3,000 gold pieces.  
Mixed in with the Chardonian coins are numerous notched silver (and the occasional gold) small armbands, used as currency among the orcs (about 1000 armbands, total value 7,000 gp, weigh as much as 70,000 sp).
 
Haphazardly piled on top of the coins are a dozen Deno'qai spears and shields. Most (10) of the spears are uncommon trade goods (total average value: 150 gp), the other two are a matched pair of exquisitely made, long hafted spears inland with silver forming a pattern that looks like a tree growing up the haft (legendary trade goods, 700 gp average value). The shields are all rare trade goods, of standard Deno'qai make and style (400 gp average value). [1250 gp total]
 
Mixed in with some rotting cloth are three silver hand mirrors of Deno'qai origin, each shaped in the representation of a different animal's head (bear, trout, hawk). These are uncommon art objects [average value 1500 gp].
 
A wooden statue of an eagle, about 1 foot high, has been partially eaten away by acid. However, the perfect pair of aquamarine eyes (rare gemstones, 1400 average value) and the six mother-of-pearl talons (uncommon gemstones, 420 gp average value) are salvageable.
 
Fourteen woven baskets of marsh reeds have nearly completely decayed on the side of the treasure pile. Spilling out from them are about 40,000 bits of stone, seeds, and other meaningless trinkets, broken shells, and trash. Mixed among these are six copper trinkets of frogs about the size of a palm, with tiny green emeralds for eyes, surprisingly fascinating in craft and appearance (exquisite common art objects, average value 1200 gp).
 
Leaning against the rest of the treasure is a glaive, made of bone and wood. The wood itself is weakened by acid, but hanging off the top is a necklace, a silver chain with mother-of-pearl between the chain links, and a pendant made from the skull of small bird with gold inlay and freshwater pearls for eyes (rare art object, 1000 gp average value)
 
Scattered among the muck are 14 freshwater pearls of various quality (all uncommon gemstones; 9 regular, 2 inferior, 3 exquisite; 1120 gp average value)
 
Neatly stored in a potion belt are three red, bubbling potions. These are all Chardonian healing potions, one greater, one superior, and one supreme. ==[greater used]==
 
A ceramic potion bottle with a spider painted on the outside, containing a (Bullywug) potion of climbing. Next to it is another ceramic bottle with an ear painted on it, containing a (Bullywug) potion of comprehension.
 
A clay and river stone pipe (Bullywug), functioning as a pipe of remembrance.
 
## Keep Hoard
 
The keep hoard is arranged in chronological order, in the following sections.
 
_Elven_
 
A 20'x20'x10' stone pedestal has been etched with Draconic runes about the downfall of the elves. On top of this are about 100,000 coins in neat piles, sorted into very small gold coins (1,000 total; 5 sp each), large silver coins (20,000; 2 sp each), round copper coins (80,000; 2 cp each); and larger gold coins (1,000 total; 2 gp each). These seem to be from different ages of Elvish history; some are very old and could potentially be worth more than their metal content.
 
Next to the coins is a silver potion vial that faintly shimmers and seems almost translucent, containing a potion of invisibility. An arrow lined with elvish script also sits next to the coins (Arrow of Demon Slaying)
 
In the center of the pedestal is a marble bust of an elven princess (about 3 feet tall), which is an exquisite rare art object but weighs about 300 pounds.
 
Laying in front of the bust is a ceremonial longsword, carved with Elvish runes (describing the history of the bearer, who seemed to have lived more than a thousand years ago, and fought in the wars of the Downfall). The hilt is decorated with amber, and the blade is silvered (exquisite rare art object).
 
_Dwarven_
 
Three pieces of columns from the chapel have been moved here, and arranged in a triangle. Stacked in a small pile are 10 silver trade bars (10 lb each, 100 gp each), marked with a Dwarven stamp of Nidzahar. Among the silver bars is a small silver orb sculpted to look like a moon, which is an Orb of Time.
 
Alone on one pillar is an exquisitely crafted necklace: the chain is made of fine gold, and each of the six pendants hanging from the chain is an intricately crafted shape looking like flowing rock encasing rubies (exquisite very rare art object).
 
On the third pillar is a collection of gems (8 gems: 2 common, 4 uncommon, 2 rare), what looks like a chess set, the pieces representing air elementals (white) and earth elementals (black) (exquisite uncommon art object).
 
_Lizardfolk_
 
Three stone blocks form a table here. Etched into the stone: 'The pathetic treasures of the dead lizardfolk who, long ago, thought they could call this swamp home. Now they are forgotten and there treasure is mine."
 
About 10,000 coins made of mother-of-pearl, of various sizes, are piled on one side of the table. There are 2,000 big ones (1 gp each) and 8,000 smaller ones (1 sp each).
 
On the other side of the table is a collection of 8 beautiful clay urns, each intricately painted with a different scene from nature. Each is about 1 foot high and fairly delicate (4 common art objects, 2 uncommon art objects, 1 exquisite common art object, 1 exquisite uncommon art object).
 
Lying in the center and clearly the centerpiece of the collection is a staff of dark wood (Staff of the Swamplands).
 
_Drankorian_
 
The Drankorian section is spare, containing only a single item standing on a custom-crafted pedestal etched with acid: a crystal ball. This is a Crystal Ball of True Seeing, of Drankorian origin.
 
_Amani_
 
At the far end of the lair is the largest set of treasures, arranged almost like a museum.
 
A stone step has been created by acid, with three layers. In Draconic, it is etched: "the lost treasures of the kingdom of Amani, swallowed by time"
 
The bottom layer is covered in coins, some spilling onto the floor. These are old, pre-Great War. Mostly silver and copper, with some gold. A total of 40,000 silver coins, 4,000 gold coins, and 60,000 copper coins.
 
On the second layer are four small stone carvings, one each of a fire, water, earth, and air elemental (uncommon art object each). Next to them, a solid metal, watertight scroll case, with faint, faded script on the outside, containing a scroll of Planar Ally. There is also a short metal wand, with what looks like a burst of fireworks on the end (Wand of Pyrotechnics).
 
The centerpiece of the collection is clearly a plain looking ring, with three small diamonds set into a silver band. While at first glance this seems ordinary, if you look at a diamond closely, it seems to contain infinite reflections (Ring of Three Wishes).
 
_Volganis_
 
Next to the Amani treasure is a stone block, taller than it is wide, with several metal hooks that have been driven into it.
 
The top of the stone block has been polished smooth and has a shallow indentation, in which sits four gems: two diamonds (exquisite very rare), a star sapphire (exquisite rare), and a fire opal (exquisite rare). These are labeled "The Crown Jewels of Volganis". With the gems is a relatively plain silver circlet (uncommon art object, but worth a lot more to a collector).
 
Hanging from the stone pedestal is a shimmering leather belt, made of some unusual scaled material (Volganis Dragonhide Belt). Also hanging is an amulet in the shape of a stylized shield, made of silver and turquoise (Amulet of Protection).
 
_Kingdom 4_
 
A cracked altar holds these treasures. Etched into the altar are the words, "The treasures of the Order of Twilight will outlive their forgotten creators, turned to dust and rot."
 
A collection of 13 holy symbols, all some variant on the Night Queen's symbol, mostly made of silver (each is a common art object). Mixed in among them is one that seems to shine more strongly, and has a open hand motif, as if saying "stop", intermixed with the normal Night Queen symbol (Twilight Emblem).
 
On a raised dais on top of the altar sits a bound book, its cover made of metal and etched with a depiction of what looks like a humanoid form made out of clay. The pages are also made of very thin sheets of metal (Manual of Clay Golems). There is no title.
 
Next to the book is a ceramic scroll case, watertight, marked with holy symbols of the Eight Divines. Inside is a scroll of summon celestial.
 
On the other side of the raised dais is an elaborate helm, probably ceremonial, decorated with moonstone (uncommon art object).
 
_Cha'mutte / Pandar_
 
The final collection is set in an open tomb, which is labeled, "The tomb of the unknown warrior, lost in battle against the evil empires of the south. Dedicated to the memory of our Lord, Cha'mutte. May your enemies ashes bring you honor."
 
The tomb has a residue of acid lining the sides, and is filled with what look like twisted, melted weapons, totally unrecognizable. Two **black puddings** live in the tomb and will attack anyone who takes the dragon statue or any of the coins.
 
In front of the tomb is a statue, about 3' high, made of obsidian and decorated with silver wire and small red garnets, of a dragon (rare art object). The dragon is standing on a pile of square copper and silver coins (hobgoblin bits, a total of 30,000 copper and 20,000 silver).
