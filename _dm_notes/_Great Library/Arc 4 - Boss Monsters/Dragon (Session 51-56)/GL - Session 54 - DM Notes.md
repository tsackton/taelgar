Attack to get things started. Camp / rest with Izkir. Plan assault. Start into the swamps.
 
Lair area is about 30 miles into the swamp from here, so maybe 2 days travel given difficult terrain.
 
----
 
**Setting off**
 
Cross the river, head into the swamp (day 1)
 
First day - rolls are 3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3
 
Encounter 1: standing stone  
Encounter 2: Nymthrax
 
Get off course, head due west 12 miles.
 
Divination reveals direction to dragon's lair.
 
Get attacked / scouted by dragon at night, turns on spying.
 
Return to the harmony stone, fix it, long rest (day 2).
 
-----------
 
**Scouting day, after long rest:**
 
Scry:  
saw lair setup
 
Lair is 20 miles due North of harmony stone
 
Long rest again.
 
**NEXT SESSION:**
 
Travel 14 miles to the wraith chapel (encounter 16 - should be pretty easy), presumably kill it and long rest. Roll to see if anything happens during the day, but if there are encounters make them plant traps or ooze traps (8, 14, or ooze pit thing which should serve to introduce oozes so they can manage to learn how to kill them)
 
Then, pick their poison: try to sneak past poison troll (easy to avoid, hard to kill) or bugbear patrol (hard to avoid, easy to kill).
 
Then, roll once for oozes or shamblers or something before the lair itself. Make a map of the 6 mile area.
 
Then, attack the dragon (need a lair battlemap)  
--when reduced to 25% hit points, will flee underwater coming out in his lair  
--general tactics will be to stay high up, use lair actions to try to knock melee attacks off his back, and try to distrupt concentration  
--will line up breath weapon to get as many creatures as possible, but prioritize spellcasters  
---use lair actions to harass spellcasters
 
It's main weakness should be discounting Aelar and Adrick, if the spellcasters focus on being annoying and keeping it occupied it will not really be worried about the pesky creatures on its back until it is too late.
 
I am Nymthrax the Befouler, Lord of Blackwater, King of Rot, and Master of Ruin, how dare you come to challenge me! Kingdoms fall before me! Your treasures will be mine, your names forgotten, as all bow before the Lord of Blackwater!
 
To Samso - "you will join your people in the shadows soon enough, I am sure. the despair will take you"  
To Brelith - "you think your home safe now? my thralls will avenge me, the poison will spread even if you bring me down!"  
To Aelar - "your people are gone, the elves forgotten. you can hide in shadows all you like, but it won't change the fact that you are alone"  
To Adrik - "you think yourself strong? when my acid has burned your flesh from your bones you will not feel strong. you may shrug off my claws, but try my breath!"  
To Izkir - "I will hunt your people to the last, you cannot survive the coming flood, the black acid will scar your forests and shrivel the trees of your homeland"
