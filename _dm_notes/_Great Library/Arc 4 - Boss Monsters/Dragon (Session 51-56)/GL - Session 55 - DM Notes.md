## Intro
 
Remind them of the situation - short travel through the swamp to a closer base, and then need to decide: try to sneak past poison troll (easy to avoid, hard to kill) or bugbear patrol (hard to avoid, easy to kill).
 
Also go over plan for dragon they discussed, and have Izkir bring up invisibility option.
 
## Path to Lair
 
### Part 1: Patrols
 
As they approach the lair, the insect noise gets louder and seems to cluster around them, making stealth difficult (roll with disadvantage).
 
**Encounter 1: Venom troll and allies**  
**Passive perception: 13**
 
Venom troll and four troglodytes on patrol. Venom troll makes a morale check each time it takes fire or acid damage while below 50% health (Wis saving throw, DC 12, on a failure dashes to escape). Troglodytes automatically flee when troll flees, but not before.
 
**Encounter 2: Bugbears**  
**Passive perception: 17**
 
Bugbear patrol: a bugbear chief, four bugbears, and two ogre chain brutes. All have acid scars on their face, and chain brute attacks do an additional 2d4 acid damage on hit. Each chain brute has two bugbear handlers. Whenever anyone dies, everyone left must make a DC 10 Morale check (at disadvantage if the chief dies; chain brutes are at disadvantage if both handlers are dead). Bugbears flee on failure; chain brutes go berserk, gaining advantage on attacks but attacking at random.
 
### Part 2: The Last Mile
 
In the last mile approaching the lair, a heavy mist hangs over everything, making it lightly obscured (-5 Passive Perception). The air is rank with the smell of rot, and biting insects are oppressive.
 
Unless the players have an approach that avoids making much noise / tromping through the wet muck of the swamp, roll tension die for the last-mile journey.
 
Then roll or pick an encounter:
 
1: two shambling mounds  
2: two black puddings and two ochre jellies  
3: field of acid quicksand (DC 18 perception to spot; whoever is in the lead must make a DC 17 Dex save or get sucked in; once sucked in take 3d4 acid damage per round; getting out requires a DC 20 Str check; DC reduced to 12 if someone tosses a rope). Trying to go around probably triggers additional traps; need a way to feel ahead to avoid entirely.  
4: yggdrasti plus 3 half-hp assassin vines, all indistinguishable from plants
 
### Part 3: The Lair Itself
 
Then, attack the dragon (need a lair battlemap)  
--when reduced to 25% hit points, will flee underwater coming out in his lair  
--general tactics will be to stay high up, use lair actions to try to knock melee attacks off his back, and try to distrupt concentration  
--will line up breath weapon to get as many creatures as possible, but prioritize spellcasters  
---use lair actions to harass spellcasters
 
It's main weakness should be discounting Aelar and Adrick, if the spellcasters focus on being annoying and keeping it occupied it will not really be worried about the pesky creatures on its back until it is too late.
 
=====  
I am Nymthrax the Befouler, Lord of Blackwater, King of Rot, and Master of Ruin, how dare you come to challenge me! Kingdoms fall before me! Your treasures will be mine, your names forgotten, as all bow before the Lord of Blackwater!
 
Look at this, the elder races come to challenge me. Think again, fools. I will enjoy gazing upon your treasures in my hoard long after you are dead and rotted. My elven, dwarven, and lizardfolk collections have not seen anything new for a long time, and I am eager to add your meager treasures to my hoard.
 
To Samso - "Many of your kind refused to bow before me, long ago. Look around you, do you see them now? No? All that remains of your kin is the treasure in my hoard, and soon that will be your fate as well. The shadows take you!"
 
To Brelith - "You think yourself safe in your metal skin? My poison can eat through even the tiniest cracks, and eat your flesh. If you want to be safe, go back to hiding in the mountains, coward!"
 
To Aelar - "Your people are gone, the elves forgotten. You can hide in shadows all you like, but it won't change the fact that you are alone, and you will die alone, and I will add your pathetic treasures to my collection to remember the day I killed you."
 
## To Adrik - "You think yourself strong? When my acid has burned your flesh from your bones you will not feel strong. You may shrug off my claws, but try my breath!"
 
To Izkir - "I will hunt your people to the last, you cannot survive the coming flood, the black acid will scar your forests and shrivel the trees of your homeland"
 
**Lair Actions**
  - **Filth Burst.** ==The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is== **difficult terrain**==.==
- **Grasping Muck.** ==Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon’s lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon’s choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be== **restrained** ==until initiative count 20 on the next round.==
- **Noxious Gas.** ==A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be== **poisoned** ==for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.==
- **Grasping Tide**==. Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked== **prone**==.== - **Swarming Insects.** ==A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.==
   

- **Darkness.** ==Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with== **darkvision** ==can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. If any of the effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.==
 
If things seem too easy, can also summon an ooze (black pudding or similar) as part of a lair action.
