# Intro

Start with introducing Mabist. Have Marco roleplay this, but start with the following:

### Setting the Scene

Party arrived back in Voltara from killing Vilaxes on 2 Apr 1748. 

[[Cleric Cooks]] opened on 7 Aug 1748. 

Pick up two weeks later. Have the party run two Bastion turns to get started, have that fill the gap between 7 Aug and 21 Aug (Marco can run Bastion turns for Brelith).

Begin on a hot August day, dry and dusty, when there is a pounding on the door. Julius goes to answer, and returns, telling the party there is a strange man outside with a letter of introduction from Dinia. Tell them they recall Dinia mentioning there was a refugee staying with her. 

Let them more or less roleplay scene. 

### Backstory for Marco

Mabist arrived at Dinia's a few months ago, where he has been resting and trying to recover his memories, with her help.

Ten days ago, Dinia's was attacked by a group of 8 mercenaries, calling themselves the Havoc Host, claiming they had been sent by Ithu'rath to bring Mabist to justice. Dinia's cabin was surrounded, and she told Mabist to flee. He ran through a secret passage; when he came back a couple of days later, Dinia was gone. 

### Beginning the adventure

Party will have heard of the Havoc Host - rumors from the west, on the coast, that they are a minor menace.
