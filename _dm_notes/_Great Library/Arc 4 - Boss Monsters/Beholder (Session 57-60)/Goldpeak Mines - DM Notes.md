# Overview

Lower levels of [[Goldpeak Mines]] have been taken over by the beholder Vilaxes, who dreams of aberrations emerging from the deeps. 

Basically play him as truly crazy. Large for a beholder - blood shot - greenish ooze dripping from his eyestalks. Believes he is destined to one of the great old ones, take his place amongst the elder evils of the world, but needs to corrupt minds.  Should be gruesome evidence of his rituals around, and if the party is defeated they will be tossed in prison until he can complete a ritual / turn them. 

Minions are kobolds - some corrupted aberrations, others scared slaves

Has corrupted minotaurs as greater minions, use a mix of minotaur and barlgura stat blocks. Also some https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/487575-dolgaunt

# Layout

Cavern continues for a bit straight, coming out in a large cavern where Alton and DMNPC are camped. Weird slime drips off the walls. 

A twisting passageway slopes down from the cavern. The walls are carved with strange, crude drawings of tentacled creatures that occasionally scream faintly. 

Should feel weird and creepy.

# Encounters

## Guards

As they party approaches the vestibule area, there are four tentacled horrors (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/487575-dolgaunt) on guard. 

When intruders are spotted / combat is joined, one will immediately start to run to ring the alarm, which is a lever in the wall that when pulled causes faint screams to echo throughout the entire complex. This sets Vilaxes on alert, and he will immediately order some kobolds to investigate.

## Traps 

The entrance area has shriekers, and also an elaborate trap:

a false floor, that collapses to reveal a pit of quicksand
	as it collapses, it ruptures several gas spores, which spread their poison and obscure/muffle the quicksand, so it is not obvious what is happening

## Kobold Lair

About 35 kobolds are trapped by the beholder, with an additional 15 that are "converted" into aberrations.

Improvise this. Should usually have 1-2 "greater minions" on watch. 

## Second Trap Room

These are explosive glyphs. Each forces a DC 15 Dex saving throw, causing 4d6 damage on failure, half on success, and making a loud boom. 

## Guards 2

Tougher guards are watching the central sanctum, which is dedicated to Vilaxes, and contains as the "crowning glory" a massive, grotesque statue made of melted treasure, of a huge humanoid like creature with a beholder for its head. 

If alarm has gone up, Vilaxes will hide, and sneak around shooting eye rays at random. 

If alarm has not gone off, Vilaxes will be in central chamber with guards. 

Will probably monologue first, using telepathy so can continue even during combat. 

## Sanctum

Vilaxes will flee here if reduced below 50% of his hit points, using telepathy to tempt characters / offer them glory in service of a god of old reborn

This chamber is strewn with writing, crude, heralding the rise of Vilaxes

The treasure that hasn't been melted into the massive statue is here, including:
potion of water breathing
potion of cold resistance
potion of greater healing (2x)
oil of slipperiness
helm of comprehending languages
11 gems worth 50 (4x), 100 (4x), 500 (3x) gp

The melted statue monstrosity is probably worth 25,000 gp in raw materials if it can be transported and deconstructed
