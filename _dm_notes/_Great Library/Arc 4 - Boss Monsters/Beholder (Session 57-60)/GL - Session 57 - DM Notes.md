## Voltara
 
Lots of rumors, updates:
 
- Archivist Lyra has returned: the elemental scrolls are proving to be far more valuable than even she anticipated. Galen, a weathy wizard on the Faculty of Metaphysics at the University of Chardon has paid much to study them, and sends his thanks as well, and a purse of 1000 gold coins, with his hopes that should you find more elemental magic or relics of Arion Mistspeaker, he would gladly purchase such things.
 
Lyra does not fully trust Galen, she does not know him well and thinks he is rather pompous. But he clearly knows his elemental magic.
 
Should they be interested, Lyra knows that Arion had another tower and base of operations in the mountains of the Mawakel Peninsula.
 
(Lyra called back to Chardon on March 1 so missed them)
 - Their steward will report a strange letter, carried by a white raven, sealed with a "D".
    - This is a letter from Dinia, reads:
       
"My friends,
 
I hope this letter finds you well. I enjoyed my time in your company those many months ago, and think of your stories fondly. I know you were concerned with the floating tower of Arion Mistspeaker, which has hovered over these mountains I call home for generations, seemingly never to move again.
 
I am afraid to report that something has changed. Some weeks ago, a great storm gathered over the mountains, a blizzard and thunderstorm beyond anything I had seen for many a year. When the storm passed, the bridge of ice connecting the tower to the mountains was gone, and every night for the next week, strange lights flashed from the highest windows.
 
I write now because yesterday, the 12th of January, I awoke to find the tower had vanished in the night. I suspect someone has learned the magic to control the tower again, for good or ill I cannot say. But you should know such a thing is out there, now.
 
In fellowship,  
Dinia"
 
- A short note in lizardfolk, addressed to Samso.
 
"My dear Samso,
 
I am journeying south, with the few other survivors of my village. Although we thank you for your aid, we have given up hope finding any more, and cannot bear the desolation of our old home. We will journey to Lake Valandros, as the humans call it, and hope to build a new community there. Should you pass that way, please visit. I would be honored to welcome you.
 
I include the last of my lilypad flour for your enjoyment.
 
Iara"
 - General rumors:
      
    - A group of adventurers from the south went digging in those dwarven ruins you found a while back, and never returned. **(HEARD - FROM LYRA)**
      
    - The Order of Twilight has started raising funds to fully rebuild the old temple south of here, they say they are going to restore the glory of the order of the old days.
      
    - The chalyte miners complain that they cannot meet the demands of the caravans going south, it seems every month Chardon wants more and more
      
    - The centaurs are moving north as the spring comes, now that the way is safe again. But Aris has decided to stay, her leg never healed properly and she cannot make the long journeys of her people. And she has grown to love the farms and fields of Voltara, she comes to roam frequently.
      
    - The hobgoblins in the mountains are getting more troublesome with Grumella gone, the legions have stayed and set up forts to the northwest to hold off the threat, but this is making it a hard winter for everyone as there are many mouths to feed.
