Scene 1: Abandoned camp
 
Obvious these are servants, no strong weapons/equipment; has been here maybe a month? Inside one tent is a dwarf-looking creature, writing "I will not disobey Vilaxes" over and over, in dwarvish. When anyone approaches, the dwarf dissolves into a pair of Gibbering Mouthers.
 
Can find clues that the dwarf creature killed the servants and horses, and also can find their armor and weapons (non-magical plate armor sized for a dwarf, +1 battleaxe, potion of greater healing, two potions of healing, and a ring of warmth). Possibly can infer something about skill/power/history of dwarf from notes (this is the dwarf paladin working for Fausto in the mace of terror vision, I think).
 
Treasure:  
200 gp  
Brelith took ring  
Left plate armor, left batteaxe
 
Scene 2: Into the mines
 
Pretty quiet on the top level. Chasm has signs of a place to rest, where people camped for some time, and two massive iron spikes hammered into the stone at the top. There are two ropes hanging that are frayed and cut at the top -- these are massive ropes, as thick as an arm, woven from three smaller ropes bound into a cable. They have been hacked apart by a battleaxe.
 
Chasm goes down 400 feet. There are multiple iron spikes nailed into the side of the wall. At the bottom is a massive pile of rope, several shattered lanterns, just a chaotic mess.
 
(the adventuring party had a bard would could cast fly, but also wanted to go prepared, so lowered lights, and had the stoneborn warrior climb down in stages as backup. when the dwarf was cursed/corrupted/mindwiped/whatever happened to him, he climbed back up and then cut the ropes]
 
Scene 3: The tunnel
 
At the bottom of the chasm is the cloaker encounter - it lurks here eating intruders for the Vilaxes, and will summon carrion crawlers to its aid with a whistle after it ambushes intruders.
