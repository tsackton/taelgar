Partially invented fey for the Addermarch game. Lots of vibes and details have come up in play and in backlinks. Some metaphysics and politics still to work out. 

# Morlaith

## Overview
Morlaith is referenced by Addermarch lore as a briar‑bound, old‑world fey presence whose influence lingers in the western hills and hollows. In planning materials for the Haldrenn incidents, a Singing Tree is described as an intrusion tied to Morlaith’s domain.

## In Addermarch Play
- Cited in connections to the Haldrenn “Fey Incursion” hook involving a Singing Tree and missing villager.

aliases: [Briarheart]

%% DM: The Haldrenn adventure notes identify the Singing Tree as an incursion from Morlaith and outline a path into that domain (see [[Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion|Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion]]). %%
