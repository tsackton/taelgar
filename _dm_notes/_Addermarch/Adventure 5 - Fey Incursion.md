## Backstory

A few months ago, Duncan, a boastful young man from Haldrenn, left claiming he knew where treasure was hidden. He never returned, and the village spoke of the malign influence of the Briarheart, leading careless folk astray. People put up wards around the village, and offered beer to the Briarheart to appease them, but didn't think much of it when Duncan didn't return. That's what happens to fools, as the sayings go. 

Unbeknownst to the villagers, though, something happened to Duncan.....
## Setup

Village: [[Haldrenn]], HAL-dren, derived from a rocky ridge, marking a place known for its stone-laden terrain (Norse/Gaelic). An isolated village about a day's walk north-ish of [[Brantor]] (so about a day and a half walk north-ish of [[Roscombe]]). This is more up in the hills, not on the plateau to the west where most of the settlement is. Probably about 60-100 people at most live here. Highland cattle

Begin on Sunday morning, in [[Roscombe]]. Set the scene but have [[Caradoc]] show up early. 

[[Caradoc]] who pays attention to oddities and the like, has heard a worrying rumor about animals going mad from [[Haldrenn]] an isolated village in the hills, roughly a day and a half walk from [[Roscombe]]. 

Assuming they leave Sunday midday, will arrive Monday early evening (May 16th), adventure start.

Should role play time with Caradoc, so need his backstory, and then time in the village.

## Adventure:

Run like the Hollow Man adventure in book, however:

- Wolf encounter more dangerous
- Each Hollow Man is constructed for one night: once they kill their victim and return to the Singing Tree, they collapse back into roots. So even if party kills first Hollow Man, they will keep coming until 13 people are killed. 
- The Singing Tree is an incursion from [[Morlaith]], allowed across by Duncan's foolishness; Duncan is now trapped in the Feywild. 
- Until Duncan is rescued (or perhaps killed?), balance is "off" and Singing Tree cannot be destroyed. Or, rather, each Singing Tree can be destroyed, but a new one will spawn. 

So, adventure parts:
- Part 1: The Village of Haldrenn. Should learn stuff, fight off wolves, eventually manage to defeat the Hollow Man and track down the Singing Tree.
- Part 2: The Singing Tree gives them a clue about Duncan, and in Part 2 they follow Duncan's path and find where he crossed into the Feywild
- Part 3: Entering the Feywild, they navigate Morlaith's domain, restoring balance.
