## Treasure


### Dwarf
Â» **Wisdom (Perception) DC 12** There is a pouch at the feet of the dwarf under some rubble that does not appear to be stone. The pouch contains: 12 gp, 45 sp, 183 cp (all somewhat dated Sembaran coins, at least a few decades old but not likely worth anything special), a very nice pearl (100 gp, Identify focus), a potion of healing, a set of [Thieves' Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#ThievesTools25GP) in a leather case, a [map](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#Map1GP) of the surrounding area with several places marked with cryptic symbols in a map case, a wooden wand, and silk purse full on [caltrops](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#Caltrops1GP). 

The wand is a [Fernian Ash Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/215729-fernian-ash-focus) and radiates evocation magic. 

- Dwarf also has a treasure map. He was an arcane trickster and treasure hunter from some time ago. 

### Naiad pool
The bandit's purse. The leather has rotted away, but the following contents can be recovered: 21 gp, 93 sp, 366 cp, a heavy silver signet ring set with a stylized valley between two mountains with an oak tree in the middle, a silver brooch set with small pearls around a knot work design with the same mountain/oak motif in the middle, and a garnet solitaire ring made of gold and set with a single large garnet. The metal is tarnished but can easily be polished. 

- A rusted breastplate, two rusted daggers, a rusted long hunting knife, and what look like the rusted remains of a dozen or more arrowheads. None are worth anything, but the naiad will insist these be removed.
- A disintegrated scroll case; the parchment inside has rotted away.  
- A strange [lantern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2188385-lantern-of-tracking-fey) that seems oddly intact, although unlit
- A corroded silver arm band, and 39 corroded silver coins (Sembaran, but 100 years old)
- A small gold amulet, in the shape of a wand with a subtle heart shape. This is a holy symbol of the Sibyl. Has a prayer, in Sembaran, that seems to be a prayer for safety in battle ("Sibyl, keep the Warlord's eyes on me as I face danger"). A unique design, not like anything you've seen before. 

- The bandit robbed the Duval family 2 years ago.
- The other dead body is a Ranger from many years ago, who carried the fey lantern and the gold amulet.
