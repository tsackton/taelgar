## Intro

Remind them where they are, outline clues (dead peddler drained of blood, ghost, zombies, bloodstains / bloody cloak, letter), remind them where they have been (mess hall - but other rooms on that level unexplored; main level explored, currently at upper level; show map). Remind them the marshal's room looks relatively safe for a short rest, if they want. Have them describe their characters. **Make note to add breastplate on way out of keep**

## Steward Wulfram's Journal

March 23rd,

Tonight, the soldier Dolf called on me in my study. I was expecting him if truth be told. After he returned from foraging with news that his companion, Piri, had been savaged by an owlbear, he had grown distant and isolated. His soul was troubled, but I did not wish to force my help on him. I knew he would come in time.

But Dolf did not come to discuss Piri’s death. Instead, he told me a singular tale and brought me a strange artifact. He said that, after Piri was dragged away, he had sought shelter in a hillside cave. There, he said, he found the bones of the ancient dead. A strange find, not marked by any signs of the Eight Divines. Perhaps a relic of the Dominion of Avatus, long ago, when those godless heathens claimed parts of these hills. But in that particular burial cave, he found a fabulous, jeweled dagger.

He had kept the dagger hidden away for the two weeks since his return. He claims that he thought of it often. That he feared for its safety so much that he checked on it constantly. He mistrusts it, he said, and fears that he has angered the spirits of the dead by taking it. My intuition told me there were details he was withholding. There is guilt in his eyes, more than befits robbing the ancient dead. But I did not push him. It seemed to take great strength of will for him to tell me his story and greater strength still to leave me the dagger.

The dagger. I mislike it. It has the feel of magic, though I dared not touch it with my bare skin. I bade him lay it on my desk. I will show it to Bartoz on the morrow. He is as keenly interested in history as he is a talented smith, and he may recognize it.

March 28th,

What a dream I had! I have never put much stock in dreams. Some of my fellows seem to think the gods speak to us in dreams, but I have always thought of them as the hallucinations of strained mind trying to put itself in order. Mortal things. But this dream! I refuse to believe this dream came from my mind, though it certainly did not come from the Father. Already, the details are fading from my mind. But not the meaning.

I was alone. I remember that I was more alone than ever I have been. The Father was nowhere in that total darkness. The Eight Divines had abandoned me. Abandoned the world. We had been left to fend for ourselves against the fiends of Hell. But I was not sad. No. I was angry. I was angry at the gods for turning against me who had always been so faithful.

I came then upon Brother Aravis in the darkness. And I could think of nothing except that he had filled my head with lies. That it was his influence that made me waste my life in the service of callous gods that care nothing for the suffering of the mortals under their care. I came up behind him then. He did not see me. I raised my hand to strike him dead. And in my fist was that dagger. With its golden hilt and green jewels.

These are not my thoughts. I have wavered in my faith in my life. All men do. But I have never lost my faith, nor have I ever held such anger for any living person before. Least of all, Brother Aravis. Brother Aravis who was a father to me after mine had been taken from me so cruelly. Wise, kind Brother Aravis.

That dagger is an object of evil. Of that I have no doubt. Were the weather fairer, I would have it removed to the temple in Valcroix. I would make the trek myself. But until the rains break and the roads dry the way is impassable. Yet, the dagger cannot remain here. Perhaps it must be melted down and its remains buried in the deep woods. I will ask Sir Arpaad to call upon me tomorrow and discuss the matter with him.

## Sir Arpaad's Note

Your Ladyship,

I, Sir Einrik Arpaad, Commander of Torvaine Watch, do hereby relinquish these items to you which were seized from a woman who was justly executed by my order on this sixth day of March. The woman refused to give her name, demanded passage through the gate for herself and her two mules, refused to pay the asked-for toll-tax, and assaulted by magic one of my soldiers when he attempted to bar her way.

The soldier was seen to by our chaplain and will be able to resume his duties shortly. 

Yours in Loyal Service,  
Einrik Arpaad

## Bartoz's Letter

Whoever finds this...

I am not ashamed that I’m running. I am no hero. That was my grandfather and it ground him down anyway. That is why he had his warhammer turned into a smith’s hammer.

I do not know what’s going to happen. I feel like a red moon’s rising. But I cannot run until I leave word so someone knows what happened.

The steward Wulfram had this dagger that some soldier found in a tomb in the woods. There were no signs of proper burial or favors of the Eight Divines; it must have been the tomb of one of the soldier's of Avatus, who tried to conquer these lands many years ago. That dagger was fine steel, though, too fine for a nameless solider, and it looked newly forged. There was some story, I believe, about about a war and a traitor and a jeweled dagger, but I can’t remember it all. My dad had the head for stories. I just worked the bellows while he yammered away.

But I know my steel and I know my gems. Serpent stones they were in the hilt. Green and white and bad luck. I didn’t like anything about it. Either it is a thing of evil or it’s stolen from the dead. No good in either case. I told Wulfram I would throw it in my furnace and let the fire turn it to dross. But he wanted to look into it. Send it to Valcroix or perhaps on to Adderfell, to be examined by a priest.

Now he is gone. Arpaad’s saying he sent the steward back to Valcroix to bring that dead soldier’s things back to his family, but I know that’s not true. Arpaad would never send anyone traveling in this terrible, unending rain. Wulfram would never travel in weather this bad. And no one would travel anywhere without coming to me for supplies.

I told the Marshal I thought the whole think stank. Told him about the dagger, too. The Marshal’s always given every man a fair listen. And he said he would get to the bottom of it. He had this hard look in his eye, and he strapped on his sw...

## On the Road

From leaving the watch, takes 2 days to reach Roscombe (arrive evening of 2nd day if leave morning of 1st day).

One day out from Roscombe, will meet a group of soldiers coming to investigate. Will be grateful, especially if Oona is enthusiastic about the party. 

Soldiers will offer 100 gold in exchange for the goods recovered from the Watch, along with a bounty of 200 gold for Marshal Brask's breastplate. Oona will encourage them to take the deal, as to her it is a fair price and saves the hassle of having to deal with the market in Roscombe and worries about selling stolen goods.

Will give party a letter which can be presented to castellan of manor for the gold, and also serves as an introduction.

**Names**
knight in command of troops: Sir Gareth Howell *(GAR-eth HOW-ell)* -> met on the road
castellan of Roscombe: Castellan Lady Elowen Duval (EL-oh-wen doo-VAL) 
priest in Roscombe: Owen Tavish *(OH-en TAV-ish)* (Priest of the Sibyl)


lady of Carlinshire: Lady Alys MacKenna (AL-iss )
earl of west: Earl William Valois (VAL-wah)

Emerge out of the forest, cross brook in a muddy ford (no bridge, but quite shallow), see town. Not quite alpine, but definitely cooler up here. can see the mountains to the north and west, a few small villages visible along with herds of sheep.

## Roscombe

A small walled market town of about 700-800 people, with a manor, a temple of the sibyl, an inn, a few taverns, and a central plaza with daily small market and a weeky larger market

Two gates: main gate where road enters, and smaller mill gate to the north 

Just north of town is the mill where the brook passes
