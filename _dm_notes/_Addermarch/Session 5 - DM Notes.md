### Signature Attack (Daggers)

*Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 2d4+2 piercing damage. Beginning at 7th level, the sneak can make this attack twice, instead of once, when they take the Attack action on their turn.

## Features

- **3rd Level: Weaving Knives (3/Day).**  
  As an action, the sneak moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Before, during, or after the move, they can make two signature attacks.

- **5th Level: Sneak and Stab (3/Day).**  
  As a bonus action, the sneak takes the Hide action. If the sneak hits a creature they are hidden from with an attack on the same turn, the creature takes an extra PBd10 piercing damage, and the sneak can immediately take the Hide action (no action required).

- **7th Level: Poisoned Blade (1/Day).**  
  As a bonus action, the sneak covers a dagger in a special poison, which lasts for 1 hour or until the sneak hits a creature with a signature attack. A creature hit with the poisoned dagger must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes PBd12 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at the end of turn). On a successful save, the target takes only half as much damage and isnâ€™t poisoned.
