Brainstorming:

Basic idea is that Avatus had given his lieutenants some kind of magic item, made them into strong warriors 

Several battles on the western edge of Addermarch

Weapons were buried with their owners, maybe in tombs or forts, or just in piles of the dead.

Discord notes:

1. the vibe is that Avatus gave his lieutanents some kind of magic weapons, probably developed in some way by the same court wizard who made the mirror of soul trapping and was obviously powerful
    
2. his armies made it into western addermarch, and there were a bunch of skirmishes and maybe battles
    
3. possibly even there were some avatus forts in the area - haven't quite figured out the timeline
    
4. then when people find the cursed weapons now, it drives them crazy and they attack their friends
    
5. before our next session i have to figure out the exact details of avatus's control in addermarch because they are looking for old battle sites to try to figure out what is going on
    
6. i don't think i actually remember the details of the orb of making zombies
    
7. but the way they are related is potentially connected to the larger idea that one of the things that powered avatus' ascent to power and strength of arms was this hobgoblin court wizard who was a very powerful artificer - already established from the dunmar campaign - which i think my intention is gives avatus' armies kind of a creepy evil magic vibe

8. the other potential thread currently left unexplored is whether there is a reason for why several of these cursed items have turned up in the same time frame. maybe the lich is messing with avatus' lost artifacts and the addermarch stuff is kind of an early test/exploration? although i don't necessarily want to connect to the lich directly.

Discord from Mike:

1. The Cleenseau connection is: Underneath Cleenseau was an old fort, build during Avatus' expansion north, but ruined. There was an odd green orb underneath the fort that, when activated, caused a curse to radiate from it that could make zombies, although it was weak and relatively easy to resist. This curse was picked up by rats and then spread to Cleenseau where it particularly hit kids
    
2. The actual mechanic was that the undead awakening spell awakened one of Avatus' lieuntants who awakened as a wight and reactivated the orb in a sort of recreation of his job in life
    
3. The lich had no idea it was under there and didn't plan it specifically.

Tim:

1. re: cleenseau / avatus - i did not realize it was also vibed as a green gem but i think it would make sense to assume this is connected somehow to magic of the court wizard of avatus
