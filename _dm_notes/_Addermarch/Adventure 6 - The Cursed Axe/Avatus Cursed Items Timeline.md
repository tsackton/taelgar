## Basic Overview

### Weather
Late snows in March, heavy and wet, delays spring.
Heavy rains in late March / early April - downpours and storms in the forest, heavy wet snow followed by rain in the highlands
Roads don't clear until late April

At the towards the end of March, a late season storm dumped more than a foot of snow into the hills. Ten days ago, the weather turned, and a week of rain turned the roads to impassable mud. Now, finally, it has been sunny and clear for the past three days, the road seems to have finally dried out a bit, and you are eager to get going. 

### Dagger
Found in mid-March by Piri and Dorf
Piri killed; Dorf hides dagger in Torvaine Watch
Two weeks later, guilt ridden Dorf shows dagger to Wulfram
Wulfram shows dagger to Bartoz, who takes it for study
A few days later, Wulfram has dream, decides it must be destroyed;
The next day, tells Bartoz of the dream. Together they decide it is evil, and Wulfram will tell the commander. Arpaad kills Wulfram and hides the body. 
The next evening, Bartoz tells Brask his suspicions
The following evening, Brask goes to confront Arpaad, is killed, and the whole thing goes down

### Battleaxe
(this is less certain - need to resolve some details)

DR 1714 sometime - Duncan comes into possession of map, possibly showing ancient battle sites; this might be via the person he later kills, or happenstance, but before the winter he has some secret information about supposed treasure caches
winter DR 1714-1715 - Duncan hangs around Haldrenn, drinking and bragging
March 1715 - Duncan leaves to search for the treasure, disappearing. possibly / likely meets up person he later kills
(late March and early April - weather is bad - slows him down)
by late April, Duncan + partner have found the treasure; possibly not fully under the curse yet
returns to Haldrenn quietly, sneaking back to his cottage in the night - saying he just needs to get a few things before leaving for good for a better life - but in reality the axe is already affecting him, and he is hearing the call to find a heart for its master
May 3rd or thereabouts - arrives back in Haldrenn; has an argument with partner, clubs him on the head, knocking him unconscious. drags body to root cellar, picks up axe - it possess him - slashes and kills partner, burns the evidence (badly)
May 4th predawn or thereabouts - leaves to search for a heart in the feywild
May 6th - finds way into feywild, encounters singing tree, cuts out its heart with the axe, flees
May 7th - singing tree goes mad, morlaith is angry and forces the portal open every night, letting the singing tree exact its revenge - animals start to go mad
May 8th - Umbraeth learns of an unguarded portal and begins to investigate

(then we have adventure - animals, worgs, portal, ec)

## Open Questions

Is there a reason these items are reawakening now, ~300 years after the war, having lain silent for so long? 
Are there more of them?
What is the connection with the green gemstone - serpentine - and magic? 
How did Piri/Dorf and Duncan/unnamed partner actually find the final resting places of these items? Was this just chance

### Serpentine Battleaxe (Duncan of Haldrenn)
- Mid-March 1715: Duncan quits Haldrenn after months of boasting about hidden treasure; despite his reputation as a talker, locals note he seemed unusually serious when he left ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:19-28).
- Late April 1715: A late-season blizzard sweeps the Highmoor, and villagers assume Duncan perished in the storm when he never returns ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:24-27).
- Early May 1715 (ten days before the Hollow Man incident): Farm animals near Haldrenn begin going mad, a side effect of the Singing Tree whose heart Duncan stole under the axe’s influence ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Session 4 - DM Notes.md:22-47).
- Early May 1715 (roughly two weeks before Session 15): Bran spots firelight and hears shouting at Duncan’s empty cottage, with scorch marks and a broken latch later found in the root cellar ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:30-33,63-73).
- (DR:: 1715-05-17): The Addermarch Mercenaries reach Haldrenn during a worg assault attributed to Lord Umbraeth’s minions; villagers recount Duncan’s boastful departure and fear he angered the Briarheart (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 12.md:26-55).

- (DR:: 1715-05-18), night: In the Feywild the party brings down the Singing Tree, rescues Vaelithar of Twilight’s Edge, learns that a mortal from the mundane world wielding an impossibly sharp battleaxe set with a glowing green gem carved out the tree’s heart, and partially disables the Nightsong Roots portal, buying a few weeks before the tree regrows (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 14.md:26-27,49-57; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Session 4 - DM Notes.md:95-103,109-113).
- (DR:: 1715-05-19), afternoon: Back in Haldrenn, the party speaks with Helen, Alewyn, Bran, and Karl, confirming that Duncan left in mid-March talking of secret treasure, that most villagers assume he died in the late April storm, and that Bran saw firelight and heard shouting at the cottage a few weeks earlier (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 15.md:27,60-63; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:19-33).
- (DR:: 1715-05-19), late afternoon: Investigating Duncan’s cottage and root cellar, the party defeats an immolated shade bound to a burned corpse showing axe and blunt-force wounds, recovers a hoard of ancient coins and a pendant of the Warlord, and salvages charred notes about “finding a new heart for his master” and the axe helping with a looming quest (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 15.md:64-72; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:35-45).
- (DR:: 1715-05-20 to 1715-05-21): On the road toward Roscombe and in Brantor, the party pieces together Duncan’s ravings about the axe haunting his dreams and demanding a “new heart,” then learns from Caradoc (who once traveled the Feywild under the name Aurenxis) and Owen Tavish in Roscombe that the ancient coins from the cottage are minted under King Derik I, the same Avatus-war era as the Serpentine Dagger’s hoard (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 15.md:72,76-80).

### Weather Context (Spring 1715)
- General concern across Addermarch centers on persistent late snows and a cold spring that threaten crop yields (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch Campaign.md:6-11).
- Travel accounts from Valcroix describe weeks of impassable mud caused by consecutive late snows and early rains, only clearing shortly before the Torvaine Watch expedition departed on (DR:: 1715-04-25) (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 01.md:47-55).
- Haldrenn elders reference a “big late storm in April” that convinced them Duncan must have frozen to death, highlighting how protracted winter weather shaped local assumptions and slowed any search for him ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:24-27).

### Notes on Possible Conflicts
- The Torvaine scout is unnamed in most records yet identified as Dolf within Wulfram’s journal; clarifying whether these accounts reference the same person would help future cross-referencing (People/Addermarians/Piri.md:25; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:34-43).
- Timing for Duncan’s disappearance varies: some notes say “a few months ago,” others specify mid-March, and villagers only noticed supernatural fallout in early May, so exact travel dates remain fuzzy ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion.md:5-11; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:19-30).
- The immolated corpse beneath Duncan’s cottage suggests violence several weeks after his departure, conflicting with villagers’ belief he died during the April storm; reconciling who died there—and whether Duncan briefly returned—needs more evidence ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Addermarch Session 15 - DM Notes.md:30-63).

### Connections Between Items
- Both relics bear serpentine gemstones and craftsmanship tied to Avatus-era legends of betrayal, implying a shared origin or maker despite surfacing in distant sites ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:75-78).
- Owen Tavish’s identification of Duncan’s coin hoard as currency from the reign of King Derik I—the same Avatus-war era as the Serpentine Dagger’s accompanying treasure—suggests both cursed items were unearthed from related Avatus battlefields or caches (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 15.md:76-80).
- Each weapon exerts compulsion that escalates isolation, obsession, and violent outbursts—Einrik toward authoritarian slaughter, Duncan toward Feywild theft—showing parallel behavioral effects (People/Addermarians/Einrik Arpaad.md:26-41; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Session 4 - DM Notes.md:22-47).
- The dagger’s destruction required specialty alchemy (Trueflame), while the axe currently sustains portals and corrupted fauna, suggesting both react to environmental energies (temple for the dagger, Singing Tree for the axe) and may demand equally rare rites to neutralize (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 05.md:26-58; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Session 4 - DM Notes.md:32-47,138-173).
- Notes hint that both awakenings might link to a broader Avatus-adjacent threat—possibly Umbraeth’s servants or another dormant power—since DM prep explicitly questions whether “a common enemy” is activating the dagger and axe simultaneously ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey in Haldrenn/Adventure 5 - Session 4 - DM Notes.md:32-47).
