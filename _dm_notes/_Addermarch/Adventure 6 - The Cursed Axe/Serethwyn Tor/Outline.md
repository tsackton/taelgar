## High Level Overview

(1) Reach Serethwyn Tor
(2) Explore the ruined hill fort and buried underground post
(3) Find the Serpentine Axe and destroy it
(4) Recover the heart from the Singing Tree

Combat vibes should mostly be undead. The fort was hidden/buried for a long time, but since acquiring the heart the undead commander has awakened his soldiers. 

Probably want 3-5 encounters before the boss fight. 

Need to decide what the story with Duncan is.

## Serethwyn Tor Outline

Four areas:

(1) Main fort
(2) Mine entrance (two options)
(3) Inner Mines
(4) Serpentine Temple / Boss Fight

Let's aim for 1-2 encounters at the main fort. Need to sketch out a basic map and flow chart. Probably can stop when they enter the mine today, so only need the fort and the entrances.
