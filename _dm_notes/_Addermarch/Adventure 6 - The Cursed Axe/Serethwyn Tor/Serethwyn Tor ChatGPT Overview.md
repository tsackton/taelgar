# Serethwyn Tor — Scale & Layout

- **Fort footprint:** roughly **240 ft long × 160 ft wide** (oval hilltop enclosure).
    
- **Rampart/wall remains:** mostly fallen; surviving masonry typically **2–6 ft**, with **8–12 ft** in the gate cheeks and tower stump.
    
- **Interior elevation:** rises toward the tower by **15–25 ft**.
    
- **Interior travel:** crossing from gate to tower is **1–2 minutes walking**, longer through rubble/bramble.
    
- **Sightlines:** broken by ruin mounds; usually **40–80 ft**.

# Scene Key (corrected factions + durable clues)

## Scene 1 — Gate & Approach: Warning Stones + Skeleton Army Attack (Major Combat)

**Scale:** gate throat ~25–30 ft wide; killing ground ~80×60 ft

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A battered gate passage cuts through thick, hobgoblin-laid stonework: leaning gate cheeks, a half-choked ditch, and a broad breach where the wall was forced down. Addermarch warning stones now stand in a rough line outside the approach—later additions, set after the victory to mark a thing best forgotten.

**What’s to be found**

- Hobgoblin masonry details: squared blocks, slit-like niches, heavy bar sockets.
- Addermarch warning stones: lichen-crusted, deep-cut markings (they last).
    

**Clues**

- **History:** the warning stones explicitly mark _a sealed hazard_, and their placement tells you Addermarch _won here_ and tried to contain something below.
    
- **Structure:** the gate is the fort’s “public face”; the inner strongpoint (Scene 4) is where command lived.
    

**Combat note (as you want):** this is the big set-piece; everything else should feel “officer/serpentine” rather than massed ranks.

---

## Scene 2 — Barracks (Hobgoblin Rank-and-File Quarters)

**Scale:** ~70×30 ft footprint, mostly collapsed

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A long ruin of low footings and collapsed roof stone—more bunkhouse than hall. Iron nails, shattered crockery, and a few heavy, utilitarian fixtures remain where hobgoblins slept and ate between shifts.

**What’s to be found**

- A **stone brazier base** with vitrified soot on the inner face (fire traces survive).
- A cluster of **stamped hobgoblin iron** (buckles, rivets) that telegraph “military camp” not peasant fort.

**Clues**

- **History:** evidence this was a working garrison supporting mine operations (uniform hardware, repetitive kit).
- **Entrance clue (subtle):** a broken wall-stone with a carved “mine duty rotation” tally (durable), implying the _mine was central_ and accessed via the headhouse.
    

---

## Scene 3 — Officer’s Mess (Hobgoblin Command Quarters)

**Scale:** ~40×35 ft, partially roofless with thicker walls

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
Heavier stonework, better sited, and more defensible: the officers’ mess is a compact building ruin with a collapsed hearth and a half-standing interior partition. This is where orders were given off-duty—close enough to the tower to be part of the command cluster.

**What’s to be found**

- A **banner-stone base** or wall relief with a hobgoblin legion/spear sigil (deep-cut).
- A **stone shelf niche** built to hold formal objects (helm, standard, ritual bowl), now empty.
    

**Clues**

- **History:** the sigil matches gate details: confirms hobgoblin ownership and hierarchy.
- **Explorer timeline (durable, believable):** months-old search activity would not leave prints, but it _can_ leave:
    
    - a **single iron piton** hammered into a stone joint (light rust),
    - a **chisel “datum mark”** (tiny triangle or cross) on a doorway stone used as a reference point.
        
- **Returner behavior (two weeks):** the second visit doesn’t “search” here—at most you find a **freshly disturbed cache stone** (one loose block reset imperfectly) where the returner grabbed stored rope/gear and moved on.

## Scene 4 — Tower / Inner Keep (Hobgoblin Command Strongpoint) — Combat Site

**Scale:** ~40×40 ft tower stump + rubble apron

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A snapped tower stump crowns the high point: thick walls, a broken stair scar, and a rubble-filled interior. This was the fort’s command post overlooking both the mine headhouse area and the slopes where ventilation might reach daylight.

**What’s to be found**

- Heat-spalled stones from the battle; broken weapon fragments fused into mortar lines.
- A carved or inlaid **hobgoblin command emblem** (deep, survives).
    

**Clues**

- **History (critical):** an Addermarch victory inscription cut into a fallen slab (or a formal “sealing marker” stone carried up here afterward): _“Mine sealed under order; do not open.”_ (Stone lasts.)
    
- **Entrance clue (major, durable):** instead of paper maps:
    
    - an **etched stone diagram** (crudely scratched into a flagstone) showing the main adit and a **ventilation raise** reaching the surface.
        
    - OR a **copper plate** (durable) with a simple schematic riveted to a beam socket—left by the original hobgoblin engineers or later Addermarch sappers.
        
- **Returner behavior:** a two-week-old visit can leave **fresh rope abrasion** on an edge stone where a line was briefly tensioned, or a **newly driven piton** (bright scratches).
    

---

## Scene 5 — Headhouse / Main Mine Entrance (Hobgoblin Mine Front Door)

**Scale:** headhouse ~30×25 ft; spoil yard ~60 ft across

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A squat stone headhouse frames the main adit: iron ring-bolts, a collapsed lintel, and a half-buried sorting apron downslope. It reads as disciplined infrastructure—hobgoblins built this to move material and control access.

**What’s to be found**

- A stone **ore-sorting table** (heavy slab) with shallow worn depressions.
    
- A **bar-socket doorway** (security feature).
    

**Clues**

- **History:** this was the official mine entrance, purpose-built and guarded.
    
- **Explorer timeline:**
    
    - **Months ago:** not “notes,” but a **stone cairn marker** on the slope and a couple of older piton holes—signs of reconnaissance.
        
    - **Two weeks ago:** the returner doesn’t investigate here; they **pass by**. If anything, you find a **freshly cut bramble gap** or a snapped gorse stem where someone moved quickly _away_ from the headhouse, heading for the hidden route.
        

---

## Scene 6 — First Mine Area (Threshold Only)

(You said “don’t cover the mine here,” so keeping it minimal.)

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
Just inside the adit are the practical entry workings—lamp niches, haul wear—then the route becomes clearly non-viable.

**Clues**

- **History:** confirms Addermarch sealed the main way hard.
    
- **Entrance:** reinforces “the explorers did not use this.”
    

---

## Scene 7 — Plug (Dead End, with Combat) — No forward route

**Scale:** plug face ~20 ft wide

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A brutal plug of slabs, spoil, and burned timbers seals the mine. It’s scarred and pitted, with embedded metal fragments—evidence that the defenders (hobgoblins) or the berserk commanders behind the line tried to force it, and failed.

**Reward (since it’s a dead end)**

- **Addermarch sapper cache** hidden in a wall recess: wedges, oil, chalk, a coil of older rope, maybe 1–2 consumables. Practical and believable (a planned assault supply point).
    
- A **warning-stone fragment** or engraved charm carried by Addermarch officers to resist serpentine influence (your mechanical boon).
    

**Clues (this is the big payoff clue, but still no path)**

- **Stone-cut sapper diagram** near the plug: “Air-raise reaches deep works” with a simple arrow to “surface.” (Carved into stone or on a durable metal tag.)
    
- **Returner behavior:** none. The returner already knows the shaft; they do not come to the plug.
    

---

## Scene 8 — Explorer Camp (A couple months old)

**Scale:** ~30×30 ft, tucked in rubble lee

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
A small, weathered camp site—more “temporary staging” than settlement. You’ll find only what makes sense to remain after months of wind and rain: a ring of fire-reddened stones, a few rusting bits of iron, and possibly a concealed cache.

**What’s to be found (believable leftovers)**

- No abandoned notebooks. Instead:
    
    - a **charcoal-stained fire ring** (stones reddened by heat),
        
    - a **broken lantern piece**, a **rusting piton**, a torn scrap of oilcloth,
        
    - and (optionally) a **hidden cache**: a waxed tube or sealed crock tucked under a reset stone.
        

**Clues (establish both visits cleanly)**

- **Months-ago recon:** a **cairn line** or discreet **chisel marks** on two stones indicating “search pattern” and a note like “vent suspected” encoded as symbols (durable).
    
- **Two-weeks return:** the returner doesn’t “camp” again—they **reopen the cache** and go. So the evidence is:
    
    - a cache stone that was **recently lifted and replaced** (fresh soil smear on the underside; the reset isn’t perfect),
        
    - a **fresh rope end cut** or newly missing piton from the stash (absence as evidence).
        
- **Entrance clue (explicit but not free):** the cache contains a **durable direction key**:
    
    - a **scratched copper strip** or carved pebble: “Shaft—north spoil slope—rain-cut sink.”
        

(So: first trip leaves almost nothing; second trip leaves “cache disturbed + gear taken” and then they’re gone.)

---

## Scene 9 — Hidden Vent Shaft Entrance (Requires skill to locate; leads down)

**Scale:** opening 4–5 ft across, partly masked by turf/stone

**Overview / Set Dressing**  
Not a visible “entrance”—just a rain-scoured sag in the turf where stone has slumped, exposing a narrow void that exhales colder air. Up close, you can spot worked rock edges and the faint geometry of a ventilation raise.

**Finding it**

- Should require deliberate searching **in the right area**, guided by clues from Scenes 4/7/8.
    
- Visual tells: unnatural straightness of one edge, air draft, scoured stone, disturbed lichen.
    

**Clues (timeline)**

- **Two-week-old activity:** a **fresh rope line**, **new piton scratches**, and a **recent knot**—this is where the returner went fast and sure.
    
- **Months-old recon:** at most, an older piton hole or a single weathered mark—because the first trip was about _finding_ this place, not setting it up.

# Clues

### FACT 1 — Serpentine mine here; sealed by Addermarch

- **Scene 1 (Approach / warning stones):** warning stones name **serpentine / green war-stone** and state **SEALED / FORBIDDEN BELOW** under Addermarch authority.
    
- **Scene 5 (Headhouse):** unmistakable **mine infrastructure** (stone headhouse framing, sorting slab, ring-bolts/bar sockets).
    
- **Scene 7 (Plug):** plug is a **built seal** (faced slabs + packed spoil), not a collapse.
    
- **Scene 4 (Tower):** Addermarch-cut marker recording **victory + sealing order** (“sealed the workings,” “do not reopen”).
    

---

### FACT 2 — Secondary entrance exists (vent/raise); it was sealed too

- **Scene 4 (Tower):** stone-scratched **schematic map** shows **MAIN MOUTH** and **AIR MOUTH** feeding the same workings; **AIR MOUTH = CAPPED**.
    
- **Scene 7 (Plug):** Addermarch sapper carving listing closures: **MAIN ADIT PLUGGED** / **AIR RAISE CAPPED ABOVE**.
    

---

### FACT 3 — Explorers were here; they found and used the secondary entrance

**Explorers were here**

- **Scene 8 (Explorer camp):** durable camp remnants (fire-reddened stones, stake holes, broken lantern part, bits of wire/cloth/oilcloth).
    
- **Scene 8 (Camp cache):** hidden cache spot is **disturbed** (stone reset wrong / fresh soil smear) indicating a **recent return** to retrieve gear.
    
- **Scene 3 (Officer’s Mess) or Scene 2 (Barracks):** a single deliberate **datum mark** (tiny chisel nick) on a prominent stone consistent with mapping/bearing-taking.
    

**Camp points to shaft; shaft was used**

- **Scene 8 (Camp):** a **durable locator token** (scratched copper strip / carved pebble): “**rain-sunk hollow above north spoil slope**” (plus one anchor like “below tower”).
    
- **Scene 9 (Shaft):** clear reopening/entry signs: **fresh digging spoil**, **recent tool marks**, **piton scratches/rope abrasion**, optional fixed rope.
    
- **Scene 5/6 (Main adit):** **no sign of recent entry** via the headhouse/adit (supports that explorers used the shaft instead).
