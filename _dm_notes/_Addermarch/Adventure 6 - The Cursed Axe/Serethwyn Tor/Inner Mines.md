**Duncan's route:** 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9

2250 XP for moderate

### 1: Entrance Shaft

Entrance shaft - reached from camp. Flooded, washed away by spring storms. Signs rangers kept watch here, but haven't been recently. Descends 40 feet to mine. Water dripping down; DC 10 Athletics to avoid slipping. Fall based on how badly fail. 

(Further back shaft on mines map - closer in shaft is completely destroyed; once served as winch to lift ore from lower level)
### 2: Mines Level 1

This is the "back" area of level 1. Mined out completely. 

**Moderate combat; Serpentine wights**

Have old coins - a few hundred silver. Avatus' symbol on shields. One is wearing a serpentine necklace - **gains a bonus action life drain**. 

6 wight minions (140 XP each, total 840 XP)
2 Wights (700 XP each, total 1400 XP)

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195269-wight (use Vitality Theft from: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4486044-wight-mcdm instead of life drain; the one with the amulet can use life drain as a bonus action)
 

### 3: Heading In

Come to shaft area, "front" of first level. Ruins of winch, cast off ore, some mine tailings. Rusted tools. Treasure with a good perception check - some scattered bits of uncollected serpentine. DC 18 to find. Also some completely crushed hobgoblin bodies - totally destroyed cannot animate - with coins, Avatus' amulets. 

Safe place to short rest.

### 4: Level 3 "Main Area"

Wights and wight minions milling around this level. Use the map, run in initiative order, and have a moderate combat spread out around the mines. Creatures are licking the walls, scrabbling for any dropped bits of serpentine ore. 

These are serpentine ghouls. Use:
Ghoul Craver (minion): https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485850-ghoul-craver (40 XP each)
Ghoul: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485851-ghoul-mcdm (200 XP each)
Ghoul with serpentine amulet: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195007-ghast (450 XP each)

Five "groups" of 600 XP each, all "packs" with at least some minions.

Examples:
10 minions + 1 ghoul 
5 minions + 2 ghouls
4 minions + 1 ghoul with amulet
3 ghouls
1 ghoul + 1 ghoul with amulet

### 6: Shaft Descent

80 feet down. Pass through the serpentine temple antechamber. DC 22 Perception to find loose stones and be able to crack way out to antechamber if desired. DC 12 Athletics check - still water dripping. Damage is based on how badly you fail.

### 7: Lower Mines "Back"

This area is not mined, it is staging area for tools, etc. All decayed now. Improvise a few interesting things to find with good Perception. Can also potentially hear sounds of scrabbling at walls from area 4. 

Not safe to rest unless creatures in area 4 are killed. 

Stairs up to level 3 are cracked - only a 4 foot gap, should be jump-able, but wights are too stupid to try.

### 8: Antechamber to Serpentine Temple

Twisting passage in the back with a weird green glow (faint). 

### 9: Serpentine Temple

Boss fight. Duncan's dead body. Axe. Heart of the fey tree. 

**Boss fight**
