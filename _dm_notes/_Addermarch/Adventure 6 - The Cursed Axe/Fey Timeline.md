Singing Tree defeated on May 18th

14 days until regrow chance starts
5 days for each root to regrow

So, for portal:
- (DR:: 1715-05-23): One root regrows, four intact
- (DR:: 1715-05-28): One root regrows, five intact
- (DR:: 1715-06-02): One root regrows, six intact
- (DR:: 1715-06-07): One root regrows, seven intact, portal opens at dusk if tree is awake

For tree:
- (DR:: 1715-06-01): 1/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-02): 1/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-03): 1/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-04): 2/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-05): 2/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-06): 3/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-07): 4/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-08): 5/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-09): 6/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-10): 7/8 chance tree has regrown
- (DR:: 1715-06-11): 8/8 chance tree has regrown

(for each day, roll 1d8 at dawn; tree regrows at dusk that evening if roll the number or lower on the die)

The portal cannot open the day the tree awakens, must be 24 hours later (at dusk)
