Arvanko lives mostly alone in a camp around a small watchtower on a hill about 1/2 mile from the eaves of Torvaine Forest, about a day's walk east of Roscombe. 

Recluse. More or less retired Ranger - he is about 270, so approaching old age. He was born not long after the Avatus wars, grew up in high mountains in a small stoneborn village near Brovna. His village destroyed in Great War - most of his kin moved south to Aurbez, he wandered. Joined the Rangers in the years after the Great War, mostly Westcliff area. Saw some things. About 50 years ago felt too old to keep fighting (during Peace of Cece I) Retired to isolation. Wanted to create not destroy. 

Picked up stone carving which he had practiced as youth before the war, but put aside for many years while fighting, from 1520 - 1675 roughly. 

Took 10 years to reestablish his skill. 
Another 10 to plan out his masterpiece. 

Now working on carving a monument out of the hilltop - a standing wall of names. 

"He’s turning the whole hilltop into a low, circular stone wall inscribed with the **names of the fallen**—not kings and dukes, but Rangers, scouts, village defenders, and “small people” who stood the during the terrible years after the Great War, especially during the Hobgoblin Wars."

At the four cardinal points, large standing stones are waiting to be carved into symbols - a tree, a fox, a watchtower, a staff

He knows history, though his focus is the more recent past, he has talked to Rangers who survived the Avatus wars. Knows about Serpentine. Can give the context for the wars. Can talk about how most serpentine was destroyed. Ledger. 

Don't know what happened to the Ranger ledger, but if you want to find more, their was a hill fort up in the mountains that was the command center during the war, when we pushed Avatus out. Rangers pass through every few years to make sure it has not been disturbed; lore says that the underground command center was buried with the commander of Avatus' army inside. If there is anywhere undestroyed serpentine survived, it would be there.

Encounter: he is a recluse, initially Indifferent and Hesitant. Can either try to warm him up, or can try to convince him to talk 

Base DC 15 for either. Fail at convincing to talk, can't try again until get him to be Friendly. 

Can improvise, but fall back is sending them on a minor quest:
probably a Medusa lair,
