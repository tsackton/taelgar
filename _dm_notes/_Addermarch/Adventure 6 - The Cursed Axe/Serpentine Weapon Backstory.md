## Basic Plot

In the ~1380s, +/-, when [[Avatus]] is drive out of Addermarch, the locals (maybe proto-Rangers) note the danger of the Serpentine weapons, and aim to destroy them. Many are destroyed, but some are not. Some kind of register or notes are compiled, which also has various battle records and notes about ambiguous sites. 

For a while this is kept, and perhaps copies are made and stored in Sembaran records during the reign of Derik I; but eventually it is forgotten about. 

Recently, the mysterious "Patron" has recovered the register - we don't need to know who or what this patron is yet, or where they recovered the register from. 

However, they have now quietly started exploring, to check the accuracy of the register and then try to recover some of these weapons, but quietly: 
- The Patron **never says “serpentine weapons” to anyone**. Their visible goal is always “Dominion history / Avatus-era archaeology / old paychests,” and they use **one or two intermediaries** per site.
- Piri, Dolf, and Duncan don’t know anything about the underlying serpentine angle. They just see _“someone with a map and some coin who thinks there’s old Avatus loot out there.”_

## How Piri & Dolf Find the Dagger (Forest Tomb)

We know:
- They’re scouts.
- Dolf steals a jeweled dagger from an “Avatus tomb” in the forest.
- This happens right before DR 1715-03-09.

We want:
- A Patron connection that’s **subtle and deniable**, not public “tomb hunting.”
    
### Step 1 – Patron → Antiquarian

- The Patron identifies, in the notes/records, something like:

    > “Serpentine lieutenant lost with pay at a forest ambush south of Torvaine; body and weapon not recovered.”
    
- Rather than show up themselves, they send or hire **one antiquarian / “historian of the Dominion”** to Torvaine _in the previous campaigning season_ (say DR 1714).
    
- Public cover:

    - “I’m compiling a history of the Avatus Wars in Addermarch.”
    - Wants **battlefield sites, Dominion inscriptions, coin types**, not “cursed blades.”
        
- This visitor:
    
    - quietly asks the Torvaine garrison/steward if there are any scouts who know the southern forest well and can show “old Avatus graves or rumor-sites.”
    - Piri and Dolf, being competent, get tapped as guides.


### Step 2 – The first look (1714)

On one of those escort trips in 1714:

- Piri & Dolf take the antiquarian to a stretch of forest ridge / low hill:
    - scars of ancient earthworks,
    - some broken cairn stones,
    - maybe locals already call it “The Traitor’s Hollow” or similar.
        
- The antiquarian:
    
    - takes sketches,
    - notes fallen stones and any Dominion markings,
    - but **does not excavate** – he’s not a miner, and he doesn’t want to attract attention with big digs.
        
He leaves for winter with just notes and sketches.  
Piri and Dolf, meanwhile, have:

- **seen the site**,
- heard the antiquarian’s muttered enthusiasm about “officer burials”,
- and had their imagination nicely primed.
    
### Step 3 – Winter passes, the ground moves

Over winter 1714–1715:

- You already have **late snows + heavy spring thaws** in canon.
- That’s exactly what:
    - slumps soil on an old cairn,
    - cracks a covering stone,
    - or exposes a bit of worked masonry and a glint of something below.
        
By early March 1715:

- On patrol, Piri & Dolf notice:
        - “Huh, that cairn the scholar was excited about?  
        It’s more cracked open than before.”
        
### Step 4 – The unsanctioned second trip (March 1715)

Crucially, **this part is _not_ the Patron’s doing**:

- Dolf, greedy and curious, convinces Piri to go back **on their own**, off the books:    
    - “Remember how worked up that scholar got about this place? Bet there’s coin in there.”
- They pry up more stones (now loosened by the winter), break into the shallow officer’s grave / collapsed shelter:
    - bones, some rusted gear,
    - a small coffer with **old Sembaran royal silver**,
    - and the **serpentine dagger** that once belonged to the lieutenant.

From there your existing chronology proceeds:

- Dolf pockets the dagger → curse → kills Piri (1715-03-09) → Wulfram → Bartoz → PCs → [[Trueflame]].

**In-world, no one except the Patron and that antiquarian ever knows** that this was one of a handful of “weapons not recovered” flagged in a 300-year-old ledger. To Torvaine, it looks like:

> “Our scouts got greedy, broke into an old Avatus grave, and found something they should not have.”

---

## 2. How Duncan & the Stranger Find the Axe

Here, the Patron’s hand can be _slightly_ more direct, without being obvious.

We know:

- Duncan is a boastful shepherd from Haldrenn,
- he meets a mysterious “treasure partner” / stranger,
- they go looking for treasure, find the axe, and Duncan goes mad.

### Step 1 – Patron → Field Agent with a specific lead

From the Register, the Patron has something like:

> “Dominion hill-work collapsed with serpent captain and men inside. Site sealed and blessed. Weapons presumed buried with them.”

That’s a much sharper target than the forest ambush; suggestion of a central depot and the main command center for the region - might be a lot more than at a random ambush. Crucially, seems to have never been explored. 

The Patron hires or instructs a **single field agent** (your stranger):

- cover: independent scholar / antiquarian / treasure-hunter,
- mission: “Go to the uplands and quietly locate the old hill-work. Confirm whether any Avatus-era relics or pay survive. Bring me what you can.”

No mention of “serpentine weapons” at all. The agent just knows the Patron is oddly interested in officer sites.

### Step 2 – The stranger in Roscombe

To fit your weather:

- The stranger likely arrives in the fall, and **winters in Roscombe**, but makes some expeditions in Oct/Nov/Dec. 

- He:    
    - asks **discreet questions** about “old Dominion ruins on the hill,” 
    - hears the usual folklore about a **collapsed mine / cursed old work** above Haldrenn,
    - explores what he can before snow and mud make serious climbing impossible.

In doing so he:
- identifies the **general site** of the old hill-work,
- sees, but cannot yet safely access, a partially collapsed entrance or suspicious sinkhole.
    
### Step 3 – Duncan the linchpin

Once the snows begin to break:

- The stranger needs:
    - a local who knows the **exact goat tracks** up the hillside,
    - is reckless enough to go into a half-collapsed hole,
    - and is _cheap_.

Duncan is perfect:

- He’s known as a **boastful talker**, always going on about secret caves, rumors of old treasure, etc.
- The stranger feeds that:
    
    - “You have no idea how valuable old Dominion silver is to collector. Help me find the old hill-work, and we both walk away rich.”
        
- Duncan agrees, thinking “finally, someone who takes my treasure talk seriously.”
    
### Step 4 – The thaw + the push up the hill (mid-March 1715)

By **mid-March**:

- The “big late storm in April” is still ahead, but:
    
    - some snow has melted,
    - ground is treacherous but navigable,
    - erosion has slightly widened cracks and shifted stones around the old entrance.
        

Duncan and the stranger:

- go up on a marginal but “just barely possible” day,
- squeeze into a newly-opened crack into the old gallery,
    
- find:
    
    - buried Serpentine Guard dead,
    - coin chests with the same royal silver,
    - and **a serpentine battleaxe**.

The stranger likely wants to:

- catalogue and carry the weapon back like a high-value specimen,
- maybe not even realizing just how cursed it is.
    
Duncan, under that first wash of influence, insists he should carry it, or grabs it first. After that:

- curse takes hold → paranoia → he kills the stranger → flees,
- Haldrenn assumes the late storm killed him, not knowing he’s been elsewhere, guided by the axe.
    
Again: the **only truly “Patron-motivated” step here is sending the stranger to Haldrenn in the first place with that Register-derived lead. Everything else looks locally like:

> “Some outsider convinced Duncan to help dig up an old Dominion ruin. It went bad.”

Exactly the “secret strings” feel you’re aiming for.

## The Stranger - Timeline

### Late Summer DR 1714 – Torvaine Watch

- **Late 1714-08** – The Stranger arrives at **Torvaine Watch**, already carrying his own notes about Avatus-era campaigns (compiled elsewhere before coming to Addermarch).
    
- He **hires Piri and Dolf** for a few days of scouting in the south woods:
    
    - They show him old earthworks and the **stone ridge cairn** that later yields the Serpentine dagger.
        
- He **does not excavate**:
    
    - Lacks tools and manpower, the ground is stubborn, and he judges it a **small officer’s grave**, not a command post.
        
    - Marks it carefully in his notebook and tells them he might “come back with proper gear next season.”
        

_(This sets up Dolf’s later “if a rich scholar thought it mattered, there must be treasure” decision.)_

---

### Early Autumn DR 1714 – Drifting Around Roscombe, Low-Key

- **Early–mid 1714-09** – The Stranger comes into the **Roscombe area** and **stays in the region**, but never in a way that screams “resident scholar”:
    
    - A few nights at the inn, a few nights at a wayside shrine, a few on the road.
        
    - People in Roscombe see him **occasionally in the market, at the inn, or asking directions**—odd, bookish, but just one more traveler.
        
- He may **ask a couple of questions** about “old Serpent forts in the hills” or “the Avatus wars” in passing, but:
    
    - no extended archive sessions,
        
    - no long-term arrangement with Sister Maera.
        
- Result:
    
    - He’s vaguely remembered as “that quiet fellow who liked old stories,”
        
    - but nobody’s going to bring him up _unprompted_.
        
    - Showing his likeness later is exactly what’s needed to jog memories.
        

---

### Late Autumn DR 1714 – Meeting Duncan on the Highmoor

- **Late 1714-10 / early 1714-11** – With weather turning but passes still open, the Stranger begins walking **higher into the Highmoor**, following his own rough triangulations for a likely **Serpentine hillfort site** above the upland villages.
    
- Somewhere **in the hills above Haldrenn** (not in the village), he encounters **Duncan**:
    
    - Duncan is still roaming high with the last of the grazing while most shepherds are already drawing flocks down.
        
    - They meet near a cairn, a spring, or a known vantage point—somewhere locals use but outsiders would only find by wandering.
        
- Conversation hits instantly:
    
    - Stranger asks about **old ruins / “Serpent stones”** on the heights.
        
    - Duncan knows the stories of **“the old Serpent fort on the hill where the tower fell”**, and can roughly point the way.
        
- They **go look together**, but only superficially:
    
    - They find the **grassy ringbank and tower stump** of the ruined redoubt, but
        
    - the ground is hard, daylight short, and there’s **no obvious entrance**—only surface ruins.
        
- Before storms close in, they **make explicit plans**:
    
    - The Stranger will remain “somewhere around Roscombe” over the winter.
        
    - Duncan will bring his flock down as usual but **meet him again in the hills** once the snows break.
        
    - They agree on a **general rendezvous window—late March / early April—and a particular landmark** (a certain standing stone, stream fork, or lone thorn tree) for their spring meeting.
        

> Key: the Stranger is _never_ seen in Haldrenn. All of this is done on the high slopes, in Duncan’s “second home” on the moor.

---

### Winter DR 1714–1715 – Lurking, Not Researching

- **1714-11 to 1715-02** – The Stranger winters **in the Roscombe–Highmoor region**, but in a way that’s easy to forget:
    
    - Drifts between **Roscombe**, small roadside chapels, and cheap lodgings; disappears for **days at a time** walking the lower hills and woods.
        
    - He keeps mostly to himself: writing in his notebook, watching the weather, occasionally buying supplies in town.
        
- He **does not**:
    
    - install himself in the archives,
        
    - become a known fixture at the temple,
        
    - or loudly advertise that he’s hunting Avatus relics.
        
- He **does**:
    
    - quietly refine his **own maps and notes** from larger-city research done years before,
        
    - double-check rough distances with carters and drovers (“how long from Roscombe to the upper pastures above Haldrenn?”),
        
    - and wait for a break in the weather and the rendezvous window with Duncan.
        

Overall effect:

- Roscombe folk remember someone like him **only when shown the picture**:  
    “Yes… I _do_ recall a scholarish fellow that winter, always out walking… asked once about old wars, didn’t he?”
    
- But nothing about him screams plot hook until the PCs connect the dots.

### Late March / Early April DR 1715 – Spring Rendezvous & Ascent

- **Late 1715-03** – Around the same time **Duncan quits Haldrenn** (your fixed point) after months of boasting about treasure, the Stranger leaves his winter haunts and heads up to their **pre-arranged meeting spot** on the Highmoor:
    
    - Still **not entering Haldrenn**; he goes straight from Roscombe → upland track → rendezvous stone/tree.
        
- They meet **in the hills as planned**:
    
    - Duncan arrives with basic gear and all his pent-up treasure dreams.
        
    - The Stranger arrives with mapping kit, notes, and simple tools.
        
- From there, they **head together to the Serpentine redoubt**:
    
    - snow still lingers in hollows,
        
    - the ringbank and tower stump stand as they saw them in autumn,
        
    - and this time they have **time, tools, and intent** to look for hidden access.
        
- Shortly after, heavy weather and freeze–thaw shifts have opened the **new fissure / sinkhole** into the redoubt’s tunnels, and you roll cleanly into:
    

> **Early April–Early May DR 1715 – Excavating the Redoubt, finding the battleaxe, and Duncan’s corruption**


### Early April–Early May DR 1715 – Excavating the Redoubt

Now they disappear from local view for several weeks.

- **(DR:: 1715-03-30 to 1715-04-10)** – Guided by Duncan, they reach the **Serpentine redoubt**:
    
    - From below it’s just a grassy ring and tower stump; but recent freeze–thaw cycles or a small slide have opened a **new fissure / sinkhole** into the old tunnels.
        
    - They rig ropes and begin cautious **exploration and light excavation**.
        
- **What they do over ~4–5 weeks (high-level):**
    
    1. **First forays**:
        
        - Reach mid-level galleries, find **bones, rusted gear, minor coin caches**.
            
        - Confirm this is indeed a **Serpentine field HQ**, not a minor outpost.
            
    2. **Deeper pushes**:
        
        - Clear rubble enough to access the **command section** and **pay vault**, discovering larger **chests of Avatus-era coin** and war records.
            
    3. **The axe**:
        
        - In the innermost chamber, they find the **Serpentine captain’s remains** and with them the **battleaxe**.
            
        - The Stranger sees a potent relic to study or sell; Duncan, already keyed up by weeks of treasure fever and isolation, takes the axe for himself.
            
- Throughout April:
    
    - They **sleep in rough shelters or natural hollows** near the site, maybe in a shepherd’s bothy or hollow tree—anywhere except Haldrenn.
        
    - A mix of distance, bad weather, and the fact that they’re basically bivouacking means **no one in the village ever sees the Stranger.**
        

---

### Late April–Early May DR 1715 – The Axe Tightens Its Grip

- **(DR:: 1715-04-15 to 1715-05-03)** – The longer Duncan bears the axe:
    
    - the more he becomes **paranoid, possessive, and jumpy**.
        
    - He begins to hear whispers about “finishing the captain’s work,” “keeping what is yours,” and “never letting another claim your blade.”
        
- The Stranger pushes to **wrap up and get out**:
    
    - He wants to **move coins + documents back toward civilization** (probably via Roscombe, then onward to his patron’s city).
        
    - He talks about “what we’ll do when we reach the lowlands,” and may want to **separate** some of the best pieces for his unseen patron.
        
- Duncan resists:
    
    - He doesn’t want to leave the axe behind,
        
    - doesn’t fully trust the Stranger,
        
    - but is worn down by cold and exposure.
        
- Eventually:
    
    - they agree to **go down to Haldrenn “just for a night or two”**: to rest properly, sort the coin in a cottage, and plan a trip out.
        

---

### DR 1715-05-04 – Return to the Village & Murder

- **(DR:: 1715-05-04)** – After weeks in the hills, Duncan and the Stranger **arrive in Haldrenn** together, heading straight for Duncan’s cottage.
    
    - This is the **first and only time** villagers see the Stranger, and even then most only see a **lamplight silhouette or hear a second voice** in Duncan’s house.
        
    - They arrive late, drag gear inside, no real socializing.
        
- That night in the **root cellar**:
    
    - The Stranger wants to **count and divide the coin**, talk about transport, and perhaps quietly put certain relics aside for his patron.
        
    - The axe’s curse twists this into betrayal in Duncan’s mind.
        
    - In a surge of paranoid rage, Duncan **kills the Stranger**, starting the small **fire** that leaves scorch marks and breaks the cellar latch.
        
- **Immediately after**:
    
    - Duncan, horrified but still under the axe’s grip, **flees back into the hills**, eventually heading toward the Singing Tree and the fey mess you’ve already set up.
        
    - Haldrenn only understands part of this: Duncan left long ago; they assume he died in the storm and the burned body is some unlucky stranger or a twisted remnant of his folly.
