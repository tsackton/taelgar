## Setup

have three leads could follow: 
- old coins and related treasure, and hint from Owen Tavish they should ask about battle sites and forts
- picture of the stranger Duncan killed (know he was not from the village of Haldrenn)
- Drou now has Speak with Dead

plus, Caradoc promise to come speak to him before they leave (he will give magic items)

Remind them who they know:
- Owen Tavish and Isolde of Roscomb, at the Temple of the Sibyl
- Gareth Howell, knight
- [[Elowen Duval]], castellan
- [[Colette du Bois]], scout rescued from goblins
- Bertrand LeBlanc, innkeeper at [[The Traveler's Rest]]
- [[Marvis Windstone]], dwarven rope-maker
- [[Wymar Miller]], the miller's son, who bought old coins from Fazoth from Torvaine Watch

## Lead 1 - History

Wymar is an obvious place to start. Could also just ask Elowen or Colette or Gareth if they know anyone, or ask for other leads. 

### Wymar Miller
Coin geek. The son of the current miller, middle-aged, has enough money to be a prominent person in town. Happy to talk, especially if allowed to buy coins (potentially at a discount). A bit transactional.
Can tell them:
- Coins are not Derik I - they are older! From the House of Entranca. Probably minted by Anselm III, who was the king of Sembara 400 years ago, in the DR 1350s and 1360s. He doesn't know the exact dates but knows he was the king in Sembara when Avatus attacked Addermarch. 
- Another cache! Where did you find them? These coins are very rare.
- Basically he should clarify the timeline and narrow in on the window when Avatus occupied Addermarch. These could have been used to pay taxes the Avatan lords imposed; gold coins are rare. 

could be a chief clerk or archivist in Elowen Duval's household: 
- Master Ernault, older man, can give basic history, has records of [[Carlinshire]] dating back to its creation in the wars against Avatus. Can give basic history, but doesn't know details. Might have some clues - both in borders of Carlinshire and some old orders "The hill-fort above Haldrenn, once called the Serpent’s Redoubt, to be dismantled; stones not to be reused, by order of Captain Sariel." (something like that)

however, the "history" thread should eventually lead to the suggest to either (a) head for Valcroix, or (b) talk to the Rangers. "Rangers don't come around much to Carlinshire these days, things are too safe - they are all off to the south worrying about the Darkwood. But if you are looking for Rangers, you should go talk to Arvanko the Stoneborn - he lives about a day's walk to the east, there is a small hill on the edge of Torvaine Forest with a watchtower on top, you can't miss it."

Unlikely to head to Valcroix - takes a lot of time - if they do, just need to improvise both Torvaine Watch and Valcroix. 

If the head to rangers, see: [[Roscombe Ranger Camp]]

## Lead 2 - Picture

Obvious starting point: [[Bertrand LeBlanc]], innkeeper at [[The Traveler's Rest]]

### At the Inn
#### Bertrand
Friendly, no rolls needed to get information
Can give them:
- Stranger stayed at The Traveler's Rest for about six months late Sept to early March maybe? 
- Kept to his room a lot
- Occasionally would be gone for a week at a time, sometimes more
- Generally ate by himself, always had his nose in a book
- Knows he came from Valcroix past Torvaine Watch last fall, and left for the Highmoor in the spring; says he was very reluctant to speak of his purpose, but his coin was good
- Outfitted for a big expedition before he left; bought a month of hard tack and dry rations
- can suggest stablehand [[Rethan Cole]] or chamber maid [[Emma Cole]] (his niece and nephew, both work at the inn)

#### Rethan
Stablehand; looks up to his uncle, will happily talk if Bertrand asks him to
Maybe in his late teens or early 20s, son of Betrand's younger sister
Can give them:
- Yeah, I saw him around; I tended his horse
- Always asking about tracks up into the mountains, above the Highmoor
- Packed him up for long-ish journeys, up to a week, but often came back scowling and unhappy it seemed, though he'd try to hide it
- Once, though, he came back happy, I remember because he tipped me a gold coin. He rarely tossed around money but he seemed unguarded this time. It was before the first snow last winter, before Viatela. He was smiling, said that he'd be gone by March. Seemed like he found something or someone he was looking for. 
- Seemed to be outfitting for an expedition before he left in March. Asked especially about rope; I directed him to [[Mavis]], the ropemaker; she might know more

#### Emma
Rethan's older sister, maybe 3-4 years older than him
Curious, will talk but will ask lots of questions, why do you want to know that kind of thing
- He was secretive, but once I did see a bunch of maps and notes spread out in his room when I went up to bring him water. Looked like a map of [[Carlinshire]]. Lots of notations on it. Clearly looked like he was working on something or trying to find something. I didn't recognize most of the words - I think it was in a different language - but I did see a few places up in the mountains marked "Avatus" and circled. I think that was a name? I think there was an ancient war against him long ago? 

### Marvis Windstone
Middle aged dwarf woman, heavy set and strong, can usually be found making rope at the rope walk outside the main gates, or at her market stall. Part of the small dwarven community in Roscombe. 
Remembers the party - they bought a lot of rope before the underdark adventure
Opens with something like "Back for more rope, eh? Hope the last batch served you well - in caves was it? Glad to see you made it out anyway"
Knows:
- Oh, yeah, remember him. Wanted 100 feet of rope - had to special make it. He was a grump - charged him double, he didn't seem to mind. Certainly had plenty of money. 
- Sounded like he was outfitting to go explore some caves or old ruins or something. Didn't talk much about it. He was pretty rude actually, told me "I'm on serious business looking for the lost history of Avatus' occupation here. Stop bothering me with your idle chatter."

### Others in Town

Probably no one else obvious they can show the picture to. He never went into the Temple of the Sibyl, so Owen or [[Isolde of Roscombe]] won't recognize him. Probably stayed away from [[Elowen Duval]], too. [[Colette du Bois]] might recognize him, if they talked briefly at some point, but doesn't recall telling him much - he seemed stand-offish, like he was on a secret mission. 

The vibe should be "he tried not to make a splash" basically. Wasn't disguised, but avoided attracting attention. 

## Lead 3 - Speak with Dead

Most obvious candidates are:
the Stranger himself
someone from Torvaine Watch

Should just review [[Serpentine Weapon Backstory]] to figure out information that can be gleaned this way

## Caradoc - Magic Items
