## Setup

have two pieces of information:
- old coins and related treasure, and hint from Owen Tavish they should ask about battle sites and forts
- picture of the stranger Duncan killed (you know he was not from the village of Haldrenn)

plus, Caradoc promise to come speak to him before they leave (he will give magic items)
