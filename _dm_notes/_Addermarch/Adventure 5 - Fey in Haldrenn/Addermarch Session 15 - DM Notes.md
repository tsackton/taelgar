this will be:
- back in village, potential search of Duncan’s house. maybe something there
- talk to Caradoc, learn about his past. he gives them magic items
- set off somewhere
- maybe a combat? maybe more of a downtime/town session

will need to figure out details including whether i want this explicitly tied to a central big bad

---

## Overview

Basic story is that Duncan found a cursed axe, with some history / provenience that is similar to cursed dagger, but left open whether there is a larger connection about why these items are all awakening now. 

The cursed axe whispered to him, eventually driving him to seek the heart of the singing tree. 

## Scene 1: Village

Duncan lived alone in a small stone cottage on the edge of the village; it once was his parents until they died five winters ago, a bad sickness spread through the village. 

It has stood empty since Duncan vanished. 

People can tell the story in more detail:
- Duncan didn't have much to do. He would take the sheep up to the highlands in the summer, but spend most of the winters and springs hanging out at Aelwen's *(AYL-wen)*, the brewer, whose hearth often serves as an informal pub in the winters. 
- Always boastful, people just thought he talked big. Kept talking about a secret treasure, but he'd always been a big talker, prone to boredom and running his mouth. 
- A few months ago, in mid-March, he said he had had enough of sitting around and was going to get the treasure. He never came back. People thought he died in the cold when that big late storm came through in April. 

A few other notes:
- Aelwen can give vibes; she thinks he seemed serious, not just goofing off. 
- Bran will tell them about how a couple of weeks ago he thought he saw a fire and shouting at Duncan's cottage in the middle of the night. Karl went to look the next morning but didn't see anything. 

In his cottage:
- simple one room cottage; hearth, bed, small table. hearth cold. straw bed. 
	- shepherd's cook by door, wrapped in the middle (broken and hastily repaired), DC 12ish
	  - dried blood on entrance (DC 15ish)

root cellar out back - half buried stone cellar with a wooden door. no signs of disturbance on the outside (DC 12ish to notice the latch is broken)
- inside, signs of a struggle, scorch marks everywhere
- cold, damp, musty. haphazard piles of apples and turnips scattered, beginning to turn
- straw in the back, a body beneath

but: remove damage resistances

Can find:
- a sack of 120 ancient gold coins, 300 ancient silver coins, a pendant that looks like a amulet of The Warlord from a long time ago
- a partially burned set of notes, scribbles really, ramblings of a madman
	- needs to find a new heart for his master
	- the axe will help
	- "It haunts my dreams" -> occasional lucidity
	- must go home, get the heart from the old stories

## Scene 2: Caradoc / Roscombe

Backstory, info dump. 

Caradoc is indeed Aurenxis (AWR-en-kiss)
Can improvise this

"This is serious."

## Experience

Killing the haunt - Medium, or Hard if they properly bury the body, possibly more (375 - 500+) depending on how they approach this. 
Bringing news back to Caradoc - Easy (250)

## Treasure

Will start next session with Caradoc giving Drou and Yvan some of his old magic, and offering everyone another potion.

## Notes

back in town talk to Helen - temple admin at temple of the mother, she tells them basic story (see dm notes), points to Alewyn and charcoal burners
talk to Alewyn  - she fan girls a little bit, happy to have them in her house, feeds them stew and sauteed apples with butter for lunch, Yvan gives her 1 gp - tells them Duncan hung around a lot in the winter, but something changed - sounded serious - was always going off into the hills
talk to Bran and Karl on way to Duncan's cottage - Bran says he say fire and heard shouting ~2 weeks ago - karl checked it out, didn't see anything but it felt creepy didn't look too close
investigate cottage - roll well - Yvan finds blood on door frame outside; inside Drou finds tracks and signs of a struggle, Fazoth finds broken shepherd's crook - tracks lead outside, to root cellar
root cellar door latch is broken - inside signs of a fire, burned apples and turnips and straw - dead body
fight immolated spirit - immolates yvan to start, he suffers almost dies; fazoth misses with witch bolt; yvan hits with witch bolt and does a ton of damage; drou uses shatter
creature attacks yvan, again hurting him, but fight wraps up as double witch bolt plus eldritch blast plus sorcerous burst wears it down, finished by drou's dissonant whispers
search - find ancient coins, amulet of the father, fazoth thinks they are about 300 years old look like loot 
find scraps of paper
yvan makes a very good likeness of the dead body with painter's kit
tell town
head toward roscombe and caradoc
talk to caradoc - he reveals he went by (check name) while in the feywild, but hasn't been in many years. worried, tells them about morlaith (which they already know). says if they are going into danger should stop by, he has some old adventuring gear for them
talk to owen tavish before dinner - tells them about history of war with avatus, confirms king on coins is derik i - connection to serpentine dagger
suggests battlefields is a good next step if they want to learn more

Caradoc pulls Fazoth aside, tells him he knows of his family, and they should say Caradoc is (fey name - look up)
