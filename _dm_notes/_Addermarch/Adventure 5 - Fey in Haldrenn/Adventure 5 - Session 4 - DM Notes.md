## Recap

Recap and update basic plot line.

(1) Some time ago (left undetermined so far), a villager from Haldrenn named Duncan left, boasting of secret treasure. 

(2) Ten days ago, animals started going mad. 

(3) Last night, Umbraeth's worgs attacked the village. 

(4) This evening, a hollow man (plant creature from Briarheart) was going to attack village; killed by party.

**The Backstory**

Duncan, the villager, uncovered a serpentine battleaxe, similar to the [[Serpentine Dagger]]. It possessed him, made him stronger, and lured him into the Feywild to steal from [[Morlaith]]. He took the heart of the singing tree, which broke its song and made him strong. 

With its heart gone, the Singing Tree began singing a song of madness and anger. Morlaith did not interfere as the Singing Tree prepared its revenge, and Morlaith allowed the portal, that had been shut, to open. 

What is not clear is whether there is a common thread between the serpentine dagger and the axe. Possibly there is a common enemy "activating" these. A servant of Umbraeth? Something from Avatus' domain awakened anew? Something else? Can leave this unclear for now. 

## The Adventure

The party is currently in the Feywild, near the Singing Tree. 

The will (1) fight the Singing Tree, and (2) rescue a trapped fey from [[Lord Serenveil]]'s domain, who can tell them what happened (heard it from tree while trapped). 

They should leave the feywild at the end of this session, knowing:
(1) they can close the portal by chopping down the wind chime branches, but be careful the tree will resist
(2) this will only be a temporary measure, because the singing tree will regrow in a few weeks (give them an exact number), and when it does the tree on the far side will regrow too, eventually. 
(3) to stop this forever they need to find Duncan and return the heart to the singing tree
(4) clues for the last thing:
- talk to the villagers of Haldrenn, someone might have heard something
- the fey will tell them to talk to (need a mysterious name), who used to travel the feywild extensively and might know more

## Set the Scene

The tree in the middle of a clearing. Spooky. Two large root covered mounds - difficult terrain. One has sapling growing out of it. 

The big tree in the middle. Part 1 is combat. Part 2 is hearing the voice crying out from one of the tangled mounds. 

### Combat

Tree is scorched in many places - old burns that have not healed, it seems. 

Use singing tree stat block with these changes:

(1) resistance to bludgeoning and piercing; immune to psychic; retain vulnerable to fire
(2) 100 hit points
(3) slam attacks reach 15 feet are +5 to hit, advantage against grappled targets, do 2d6+4 damage; remove grappled component

Villain actions:

Grapple: roots pull everyone close. DC 13 Str save, on failure grappled and pulled to 10 feet from tree. While grappled take 1d6+2 damage at start of each of your turns. 

Sing: uses sing attack against everyone. on fail, roll random target to attack. save ends at end of turn.

Summon: create needle swams

### Rescue

Two fey - tall, elegant. servants of lord serenveil. were trapped, attacked the tree. one was killed, the other survived. 

Can talk about fey politics a bit. improvise. 

Will give Fazoth a carved wooden wand, intwined with silverly light. functions as rod of pact keeper +1. 

## Treasure

Currently, not counting potions:

Fazoth: 1 common
Drou: none
Yvan: 1 uncommon, 1 common

the fey can give Fazoth a rod of the pact keeper (serenveil token)
maybe there is another fey - killed by the tree - with something for Drou?

Given out 2 common, 1 uncommon
Can give out another 2 uncommon from the fey?
- one is rod of the pact keeper
- one is ??

only gave rod of pact keeper for magic. caradoc should give something drou can use and maybe something else for yvan?

speak to fey. he is Vaelithar (VAY-lih-thar)
comes from Twilght's Edge
tells story - memory from when trapped
man from mundane world with a battle axe, impossibly sharp, a glowing green gem attached
attacked
took heart
song got corrupted, turned to anger and violence
must return heart to stop it. until then cannot be destroyed, will regrow. 
some background on briarheart vs serenveil vs gloomshaper
tells how he and Liraene had attacked tree, burned it, but got captured
does not know who the person from the mundane world was, but says if you need to learn more go seek Aurenxis (AWR-en-kiss), the transmuter, an alchemist who used to travel in the feywild a lot and might know more. 
(meta: Aurenxis, as Isaac predicted, is actually Caradoc; but characters don't know this yet)
digs up dead companion, Liraene (Lih-RAY-neh)
says goodbye to her
takes items - pendant which he brings with him back to Twilight's Edge; silver ring (braided silver, 6 small orange gems; not magical but very pretty); silver wooden wand, rod of pact keeper +1
tells the party: the tree will regrow in 2 weeks, maybe 3 weeks time. already see a sprout forming (the tree decayed to dirt within minutes of being killed). closing the portal will buy more time
departs, party goes outside

---
destroy the portal - freeze the wind chimes so they make a mismatched tone, and then drou plays notes to match the correct tune, which sets up a feedback loop that causes them to burst from the resonance. destroy 4, leave 3 intact. 
will regrow of course - not permanent by any means - but will take longer (meta, adds 2 days to timeline for each wind chime destroyed)

---
return to town after stopping to camp for the night and long rest. end in mid-afternoon of the next day as arrive back at haldrenn. 
(meta: clock starts at midnight on day they arrive back to town, so the midnight prior; each midnight ticks up by one, so the next midnight count will be at 1)
