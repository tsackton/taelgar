## Basic Outline

Duncan stole treasure from [[Morlaith]], so in return Morlaith stopped watching the passages from the Feywild into Addermarch, at least in this area. There is a particular fey crossing which now has two problems:
- Singing Tree is getting back at Haldrenn for an ancient perceived slight, and probably can't be reasoned with, just needs to be destroyed (this is the Hollow Men)
- Various nasties from [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]] domain

Everything is coming through a portal that opens on the first breeze after nightfall, when strange sounds echo among the roots of a massive, out-of-place fallen tree.

The logic here should be that each night, a Hollow Man appears, and will keep appearing until the Singing Tree is destroyed or until 3 people are killed. 

The Singing Tree is hidden by a fey glamour except for a few hours each night during and after the Hollow Man's attack. When not hidden, it can be tracked by a combination of fey lantern and following the Hollow Men tracks. 

The Singing Tree itself is only about 5 miles from the village. There is a wooded area in the lea of the 4th ridge (just east of map below), and it is in this. 
## Haldrenn Map

Not very informative. 

Basic geography:
Village lies in the lea of the closest ridge line. West of the village is the forest; cart track leads roughly south, then turns west. Pastures also lie north and south of the village, and historically (although not now) in the next two valleys, where there are often small springs.

### **1️⃣ Approaching the Hollow at Dusk**

> The wind dies as you crest the rise. Before you lies a hollow in the moor — a fallen oak, half-buried in heather, its roots thrusting skyward like the ribs of some great beast. The air here feels thick, expectant; even the midges hang motionless. In the stillness, you hear it — a low murmur threading through the roots, almost like words carried by the coming night.


### **Portal Behavior**

**Condition:** Opens when the **first night wind** blows from west to east (the direction of sunset). 
**Manifestation:**
- The roots creak and bend into an arch.
- The hollow darkens into misty shadow threaded with faint starlight.
- Voices ride the wind—soft, unintelligible, like distant lament.     
**Crossing:**
- Waiting until nightfall allows safe passage.
- Imitating the wind’s song (DC 16 Nature or Performance) forces it open early.
- Disturbing the stillness (loud noise, cutting roots) breaks the effect until the next dusk.
- **Feel:** Cold air flows outward; hair and grass bend toward the hollow as if breathing.

| DC 14 Nature           | Recognize the wind’s resonance as fey magic, natural not ritual.                          |
| DC 16 Arcana           | Realize the gate links to the **Briarheart’s domain**; not broken, merely abandoned.      |
| DC 18 Religion/Insight | Identify Morlaith’s name whispered in the wind; sense lingering indifference, not malice. |

### **2️⃣ The Portal Awakens**

> As the first breath of evening wind sighs across the moor, it catches in the hollowed trunk. The roots creak and bend, their silhouettes forming a rough arch as the space within darkens and deepens. The murmuring grows into a chorus of half-heard voices — sorrowful, wistful, strangely indifferent. A cool draft flows outward, smelling of wet earth and something older than the world you know.

---

### **3️⃣ The Hollow Man Emerges**

> The whispers rise into a keening note, and from the shadow within the roots something steps forward — a figure woven of bark, straw, and thorns, its hollow face lit by a faint, inner glow. Each movement cracks like splintering wood. It turns toward you, head tilting in a gesture too human to be comforting, and in a dozen stolen voices it whispers, “The song must end.” Then it lunges.


---

### **On the Far Side (Feywild Glimpse)**

> Should the party cross, the ground softens underfoot — the scent of peat gives way to damp loam and moss. The moor is gone, replaced by towering trees draped in ivy, their canopies blotting out a twilight sky where no stars shine. The wind still carries the same voices, but here they hum within the living wood itself. Somewhere beyond the trunks, faint and haunting, a song rises and falls — the Singing Tree calling through the forest.
