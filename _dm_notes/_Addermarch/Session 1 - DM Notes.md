## Marshal Brask's Letter

Aida,

It is with great sadness that I write you. I am Marshal Hildo Brask, second in command of Torvaine Watch under Sir Einrik Arpaad. Our temple steward, Wulfram, has no doubt reached you by now with the news of Piri’s accidental passing and has returned your brother’s possessions to you. Unfortunately, our commander dispatched Wulfram so suddenly that I did not realize he was going until he had already gone. Otherwise, I would have sent this letter and these items along with him.

You will be pleased to know Piri was well liked by his fellows. He raised our spirits during the wet, boring winters here. He was quick with a joke and a song. He even took up whittling small trinkets. I thought you might appreciate the figure he carved for me, which I have included. His fellows and I have pooled some coin together. I know no amount of gold can ease your loss, but...

(the letter trails off, obviously meant to be finished)
