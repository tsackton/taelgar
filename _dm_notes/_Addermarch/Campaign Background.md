# Notes

Set in Addermarch, based around a patron of some kind, an eccentric person with a fey connection, in a borderland village. 

Keep open the possibility the patron is not entirely on the up-and-up. 

Everyone has their own reasons for joining up, whether money or something else.

First adventure ideas:
- Silverypine Watch? Could work with some slight modifications as the pre-adventure, set on the road from Addermarch to ~village~
- Otherwise might have to improv something? But kind of like Silverypine Watch idea

Second adventure could be from Flee, Mortals (goblin lair)

Session 0 rules / ideas:
- Lean into zany/heroic a little bit, rule-of-cool style
- Award XP instead of milestone leveling? But can only level up in town.

Need to develop:
- Addermarch, a bit; at least some basic maps/outlines revised from OneNote
- The main village, in detail
- The patron

## Setup

Initially, focus on a small area of western Addermarch, maybe something like four settlements:
- A small market town, connected by a cart track to the river valley (maybe Lissanvale?); presumably fortified (and maintained), perhaps with a castellan 
- A largish farming village, with maybe 100 people, near some significant/interesting site, probably mostly farmers or herders (maybe mostly cattle? sheep?)
- A small forester village on eaves of woods
- Maybe a second farming village
- Maybe another settlement of some kind?

Then, a few local points of interest:
- A ruined castle on a hill
- A stone circle
- Maybe one other thing

Patron: alchemist with a strange background, need to think a bit on this. maybe not fey related?\
