## Background

Caradoc has recently had word spread among the taverns in Addermarch that he is looking for mercenaries to assist him in dangerous tasks, for good pay, and that anyone who wishes to join his service should be in the town of Roscombe by the third Sunday in April.

Roscombe is a town in the lightly populated northwestern highlands of Addermarch, about 50 miles from the crossroads at Valcroix. This is hilly forests and mountains, much less settled than the prosperous Aben river valley, where people scratch out a living from the hard land. 

The road, more of a cart track really, follows the relatively lower Umber for the first 15 miles or so (15.5 exactly), passing along small villages. It enters Torvaine Forest as it turns south, away from the Umber, and ascends the gentle wooded slopes for another 15 or so miles (16.5 exactly), before passing Torvaine Watch, a small keep and toll gate on the road that guards the valley. 

From Torvaine watch, continues another 17 miles before emerging from the forest in a high-elevation valley, and crosses the Dunburn at a ford, and continues another 3 miles to Roscombe. 

Mounted soldiers on good horses can make the trip from Valcroix to Torvaine Watch in a long day, in good weather, but even with the road, it is a 3-day trip for a loaded wagon, with another 2 days to reach Roscombe from the watch. 

**Torvaine**

- **Pronunciation**: **TOR-vayn**
- **Inspiration**: A blend of "tor" and "-vaine" (reminiscent of "fane," meaning temple or sacred space), giving it an air of reverence or old magic.
- **Vibe**: Implies a forest that is not only elevated but holds a sacred or mystical quality, like a temple in nature.

10.5 + 7 + 3.5 = 21
7 + 6 + 3.5 = 16.5
12 + 3.5 = 15.5 

## Travel

It is late spring - the middle of April - and you've been stuck in the crossroads town of Valcroix for some time. 

At the towards the end of March, a late season storm dumped more than a foot of snow into the hills. Ten days ago, the weather turned, and a week of rain turned the roads to impassable mud. Now, finally, it has been sunny and clear for the past three days, the road seems to have finally dried out a bit, and you are eager to get going. 

Oona Stonebridge, a halfling peddler traveling alone, with her cart is hiring adventurers to travel with her, serving as guards and company, and will pay 5 gp per person if you join her. 

### Scenes

Assuming they join her, run all the A and B scene, but changing the feral dogs to **two mohlers** from Flee Mortals. Lore is these are pests in the woods. Some kind of monsterous creation from long ago (unleashed by [[Avatus]] but this wouldn't be common knowledge). Will be a bit strange to Oona that they are here, normally the watch from Torvaine Watch keeps the road clear. 

Even more strange to see peddler dead. 

**Timing** is slightly different. 
Day 1 - along the river, 10 miles
Day 2 - into the forest, 5 miles then 3 miles in forest, slow going
Day 3 - forest, encounters happen, end after 8 miles so 26 miles total
Day 4 - watch midday (after 4 miles)
*Watch*
from leaving the watch, takes 2 days to reach Roscombe. So if they don't long rest at watch, arrive Roscombe midday after 6 days of travel.
