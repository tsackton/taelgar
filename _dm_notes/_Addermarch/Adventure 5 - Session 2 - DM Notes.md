The logic here should be that each night, a Hollow Man appears, and will keep appearing until the Singing Tree is destroyed or until 3 people are killed. 

The Singing Tree is hidden by a fey glamour except for a few hours each night during and after the Hollow Man's attack. When not hidden, it can be tracked by a combination of fey lantern and following the Hollow Men tracks. 

The Singing Tree itself is only about 5 miles from the village. There is a wooded area in the lea of the 4th ridge (just east of map below), and it is in this. 
## Haldrenn Map

Not very informative. 

Basic geography:
Village lies in the lea of the closest ridge line. West of the village is the forest; cart track leads roughly south, then turns west. Pastures also lie north and south of the village, and historically (although not now) in the next two valleys, where there are often small springs. 


## Scene 1: Wolf Combat

Ended on the cliffhanger of approaching the village, under attack by fey wolves. 

Begin with fey wolf combat. Worgs will taunt players, mention [[Morlaith]]. 

Abysal Hyena (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485764-abyssal-hyena), XP 40 each
Worgs (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4831031-worg), XP 100 each
Death Dog (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194961-death-dog), XP 200 each

1 Death Dog, 3 Worgs, 15 Minions

200 + 300 + 600 = 1100 XP

During combat, villagers are at risk, although make sure no kids die and don't make it too hard. 

## Scene 2: Aftermath

Can speak to villagers. With the party having found Rowena and helped against wolves, villagers will be very happy to talk. Assume party will keep watch at night, but generally should not make this eventful. 

## Scene 3: The Next Day

Problem with the adventure as written is there is nothing for the party to do during the day. 

Can learn about:
- Duncan, who went missing some time ago and was never found. Foolish man, boastful. 
- Morlaith and the ancient tales of dangerous fey

Next morning, someone in the village is worried about dreams. Had a nightmare, Hollow Man coming. 
Sister Helen has more lore.

If they search for fey, can find a brownie or sprite or something this, a fairy of some kind. Can reveal more of the story of Morlaith - Morlaith is angry, a human took something that did not belong to him, and now Morlaith is punishing the humans, something like that, can improvise but basic idea is Morlaith is not evil but is uncaring and responds without empathy. 

(e.g., normally Morlaith keeps the Singing Tree and things like it in the Feywild, but stopped maintaining the boundaries)

(brownie/sprite might be from Serenveil's domain for interest, maybe a traveler, just curious, but also now worried about passing through Morlaith's domain to return)

Basic idea is should get clues to piece together that, (a) something bad might happen tonight, and (b) the source cannot easily just be discovered. 

Use the information from the published adventure for village support, fire options. 
## Scene 4: The Hollow Man

The Hollow Man comes. Initially the clue is subtle, a sparklingly trail in the distance leading east (probably won't need to develop this clue yet) and making it obvious that the Hollow Man serves the Singing Tree as his master, and came from it. This is the opportunity to track. Potentially play up the lantern, faint pulsing as if strong fey is somewhere.
