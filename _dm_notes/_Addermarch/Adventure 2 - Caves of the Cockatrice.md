## Setup

A few events start the session, which begins on the 3rd Sunday in April (Day 8):

### The Traveler's Rest

Introduce the inn and the innkeeper. It is a Sunday morning, unseasonably warm and pleasant after a month of snow, rain, and bad weather. Over breakfast, innkeeper brings two letters.

>[!info]+ Inns and Taverns in Roscombe
> ***The Traveler's Rest.*** The only inn in Roscombe, a well-built two story building against the wall, near the South Gate (where the road from Valcroix enters town). Run by Bertrand LeBlanc, charming middle-aged man, with a personal connection to the Traveler. Efficient and organized, and a decent cook as well. 
> 
> ***The Raven's Roost.*** A popular tavern on the market square, where the locals hang out. Run by Madeline Brewer, a young woman, daughter of the old tavern keeper who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Madeline took over the family business and has been thriving. Known for their beer, and the primary brewer in town. 
> 
> ***The Toad.*** A slightly run down tavern, also on the market square. Known for music but a bit seedy. Run by Rhys Dafydd *(REES DAV-ith)*, an older man who's lived here forever and knows all the stories, but doesn't really put much effort into maintenance and has no (living) children (won't talk about family). 

#### Owen Tavish

A short letter from Owen Tavish, the priest of the sibyl at the temple in town, who has gone south before dawn to meet Sir Gareth, who is temporarily keeping watch on the fort, to help cleanse the ghost. Urges Fazoth to keep the dagger locked away and safe. Asks to speak with Fazoth and the party when he returns. 

>[!info]  Letter from Owen Tavish
>Dear Fazoth, and company,
>
>I write in haste as I depart this morning before dawn. Sir Gareth Howell has requested divine aid to cleanse the haunting at Torvaine Watch, so I ride south to aid him. I dearly wish to speak with you regarding the cursed dagger you have recovered, but it will have to wait until I return, for duty calls me now. Should you wish, you may leave the dagger in the care of Isolde, the temple steward at the Temple of the Sibyl, who can keep it under lock and key in the temple vaults. I leave this up to your judgement, but no matter what, keep it secret, and keep it safe! 
>
>The blessings of the Sibyl on you,
>Owen Tavish

#### Castellan

The Castellan of the Roscombe Manor, Lady [[Elowen Duval]] (EL-oh-wen doo-VAL), has also written a short note. It is sealed with green wax, imprinted with the Duval seal, showing a stylized valley between two mountains with an oak tree in the middle. 

>[!info]  Letter from Lady Elowen
>Dear Fazoth, Drou, and Yvan,
>
>Thank you for speaking with me yesterday. Overnight, I have received more news from the Sir Gareth and his company of soldiers. I did not realize you had managed to defeat such a large number of zombies! Sir Gareth says he found the watch deserted, with only the ghost and the dead bodies of 10 defeated undead. He sends his thanks to you for making the road safe again for travelers. I join him in this, and in appreciation I have sent a small purse to Bertrand to fund your stay in town for the next week. 
>
>I am aware that you are intending on joining Caradoc's service. However, I hope that if your duties allow, you will join me at the manor for dinner next Friday night. I would get to know you better, as there are at times small tasks that might be suitable for such a group as yourself to undertake, with suitable compensation. 
>
>I have also heard that one of your number is an accomplished musician, and if she would be willing, I would dearly love to hear her play at dinner. 
>
> In dedication to the service of Earl William Valois and the holy protection of the Sibyl,
> Your servant,
> Lady Elowen Duvall 

#### Move On

Let party digest this and do things around town. There is the main market on Wednesdays and Sundays, so if there is a desire to sell anything else, today is the day. Can also go to the temple, or do anything else in town. 

Caradoc will be in town by late afternoon and is expecting to meet the party at The Raven's Roost around 6 pm. 

### Caradoc

Set up the Raven's Roost, and introduce [[Caradoc]]. Bit of an air of mystery about him. Tells them he often has need for unusual ingredients in his work, and is too old now to tromp around the hills and forests finding them. Will, of course, pay well, in coin or product, as preferred. 

Lives outside the small village of Brantor, about a 4 hour walk. Not much there - about 80 people, mostly shepherds, but can arrange lodging in the village if the group wishes. But it is well-placed for his work (he says cryptically, without explanation). Happy to send letters or come visit Roscombe if they'd prefer the larger town.

Introduce first adventure - he needs the gizzards of a cockatrice. They are rare around here, but there is a place in the hills where the shepherds keep the sheep from straying because they sometimes don't return, and it is rumored to be a cockatrice lair. It is only about a day's walk to the west, through mostly cleared lands, but the last few hours to the lair are up a bit of a steep hill. You'll know it by the old standing stone circle nearby. 

He will pay 50 gold pieces each for successfully returning the gizzard of a cockatrice, plus they may keep treasure they recover from the lair. Alternatively, he will offer two potions each (choose from potion of healing, potion of climbing, potion of advantage - max 1 each, potion of resistance - max 1 each).

## Travel to the Cave

The cockatrice cave is about 15 miles southwest of Roscombe, in the hills. Travel is easy, mostly through cleared pastureland, but the approach is a bit trickier. From the cleared pastures, can see the rocky outcropping in the woods want to reach, but getting through the woods is not trivial.

The party may pass through or near the village of Kilrath. If they talk to anyone on the road, may here about Giles, a local boy that went missing in the forest a week ago. 
#### A1: Rocky Hill

DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate through the woods. Failure get lost and realize only after traveling some distance. 

Finding the rocky outcropping leads to:
- Scramble up a steep hill, and see in small, rocky valley below what looks like once was a circle of standing stones. There are five stones in total, each about 12 feet tall; four remain standing but one has fallen over and cracked. 
- The stone circle is set in a small dell, with rocky slopes on all sides. Trees grow elsewhere but seem to avoid the dell itself, which has some grass but is otherwise open. 
- There is a cave entrance in the side of the dell, to the northeast.

#### A2: The Standing Stones

Once five stones, but the northeastern stone has fallen. Stones are oddly cold to the touch and the area near them is chilled. Can hear faint sounds of laughter -- sounds cruel and unpleasant -- and the clash of swords, as a duel. But can't see anything. 

Written on the stones in faded letters, in a strange alphabet (mariner language) in an unknown language (old Tyrwinghan), that warns travelers to not be fooled by fey tricks and warns fey not to pass the stones. Mentions Lord Umbreath a lot, who seems to be responsible for a lot of misery in these parts.

If someone enters the circle, make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a [quickling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17299-quickling) sneaks through. Will try to hide in the grass, and make mischief in general.

#### A3: Cave Entrance

The entrance to the cockatrice lair is obvious. It is a narrow but very tall slit in the hills. For the first 25 feet, it is like a wide gully, the sky visible above, but it gets narrower until the actual underground entrance appears. 

The entrance is littered with rubble. Close inspection (DC 13 Investigation or Nature) reveals the rubble is made up of shattered pieces of what look like sheep statues. 

## Caves of the Cockatrice

![[cockatrice-cave-map.png]]


>The rough-walled tunnel opens up to a series of larger caverns ahead. Numerous pieces of broken stone lie on the ground, many appearing to be finely carved. One piece is recognizable as a stone humanoid hand, broken off at the wrist.

### C1: Cavern Entrance
*At the junction of four rough-walled natural tunnels, a lifelike statue of a dwarf stands solemnly, its gaze fixed upon its two broken arms scattered at its feet. The air is cool and carries a faint whisper of distant water.*
#### Set the Scene
» The cave is dark. The heroes need a light source to see clearly.
» The atmosphere is damp, with the scent of earth and moss prevalent.
» Gentle wisps of wind emanate from cracks in the north wall, through which can be heard the faint sound of running water.
» The dwarf statue appears remarkably detailed and lifelike.
#### The Dwarf Statue

The statue is incredibly lifelike, suggesting it is a petrified dwarf. Unfortunately, the petrification is permanent, and the dwarf cannot be restored.

» **Wisdom (Perception) DC 12** There is a pouch at the feet of the dwarf under some rubble that does not appear to be stone. The pouch contains: 12 gp, 45 sp, 183 cp (all somewhat dated Sembaran coins, at least a few decades old but not likely worth anything special), a very nice pearl (100 gp, Identify focus), a potion of healing, a set of [Thieves' Tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#ThievesTools25GP) in a leather case, a [map](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#Map1GP) of the surrounding area with several places marked with cryptic symbols in a map case, a wooden wand, and silk purse full on [caltrops](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/equipment#Caltrops1GP). 

The wand is a [Fernian Ash Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/215729-fernian-ash-focus) and radiates evocation magic. 

» **Intelligence (Investigation) DC 12** A closer look at the statue reveals it is a petrified humanoid. The unfortunate explorer is dead and cannot be restored from their petrified state (see area C5 for more information).
####  The Northern Wall
Any character inspecting the cracked northern wall notices gentle breezes and faint sounds of running water. 

» **Wisdom (Perception) DC 13** An ancient Sylvan glyph is spotted etched into the stone of the north wall. 

» **Intelligence (Arcana or History) DC 14** Recognizes the glyph as the mark of the Shadow King, a dark fey lord.

» **Strength (Athletics) DC 14** The cracked wall can be broken through, but the noise alerts the cockatrice and her hatchlings in area C4.

If a character touches the glyph, they are momentarily overcome by a feeling of intense panic, as if something is chasing them. Then the wall fades for a moment, revealing the passage to area C2.

#### Move On
The party can choose any of the four tunnels branching from this cavern. The the northeast passage leads to area C6. The southeast passage leads back outside. The two western passages lead to area C5. Discovering the hidden passage to the north leads to area C2. Proceeding noisily may attract unwanted attention from creatures deeper within.

### C2: Throne of the Gloomshaper
*In this cavern, a large sinkhole reveals an underground stream flowing west to east, 20 feet below the cavern floor. In the northwest corner, a cracked statue of an fae (missing its head) sits atop an ornate stone throne, holding a glyph-marked darkwood bracelet.*
#### Set the Scene

- The room is dark; the characters need a light source to see.
- A sinkhole in the center exposes an underground stream 20 feet below.
- A cracked statue of a humanoid - missing its head - sits on a stone throne in the northwest corner.
- The statue holds a glyph-marked darkwood bracelet in one hand.
- This room is a safe place for a short rest, if the naiad has been pacified
#### The Statue
The statue is a depiction of some unknown fey lord. Perhaps [[Lord Umbraeth]] himself, or one of his [[Duskhounds]]. Perhaps an ally or prince. It is hard to say, as the head is missing. 

**Intelligence (History or Nature) DC 12** Realizes the statue is not a petrified creature but a centuries-old depiction of a fey lord. Success by 5+, suggests this is very old, many, many centuries old. 

The [darkwood bracelet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9041715-darkwood-bracelet)is etched with ancient writing in Sylvan and has the following properties in addition to its description:

- Radiates Conjuration magic.
- The bracelet is attuned to the fey gate in area C4, as are the cockatrice and her offspring, giving the wearer has advantage on **Wisdom (Perception)** checks to notice those creatures.

#### The Sinkhole
There is no obvious way to descend to the stream without a rope, but with an anchored rope this descent is possible (Strength (Athletics or Acrobatics), DC 8, on failure slip and fall taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage). 

The stream is only about 4 feet deep, but is very cold. Spending more than 10 minutes in the water requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid 1 level of exhaustion. 
#### Move On

- The party can explore the stream below by navigating the sinkhole.
  - The western branch leads to area C3.
  - The eastern branch leads out beyond the caverns, quickly becoming too narrow to pass through. 
- Exits from the cavern also lead back to area C1 or deeper into the dungeon.

### C3: Waterfall
*In this 20-foot-high cavern, a narrow waterfall cascades from above into a pool in the middle of tthe floor, then flows out through a tunnel connecting this area to C2. Mist fills the air, and the sound of rushing water echoes throughout the chamber.

#### Set the Scene

- The room is dark; the characters need a light source to see.
- The cavern is filled with mist, which makes the room [Lightly Obscured](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LightlyObscured) even with a light source. 
- The ground is damp and slippery due to the waterfall's spray.
- The sound of the waterfall is loud, making it harder to hear other noises.
- **Wisdom (Perception) DC 13**: Characters notice a narrow ledge behind the waterfall.
- This room is a safe place for a short rest, if the naiad has been pacified

#### Call to Action
- There is a Naiad hidden in the pool in the room, driven mad by the dark influence of Duskmire. 
- **Wisdom (Perception) check DC 13** the sounds of something moving in the water can be heard, but there is nothing to see.

#### The Naiad
Hidden in the pool is an invisible [Naiad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/909494-naiad). It has been trapped here for centuries and has gone mad with the dark influence of Duskmire seeping into this area.

The Naiad will cast Hypnotic Pattern as soon as it can. If it manages to daze the entire party, it will move quickly to tie them up, and then wake them. Will ramble for a while about nasty disgusting mortals polluting its precious water, play up the obsessive madness here. May mention the Gloomshaper?

There is a cause to the madness: a starving [blood borne ooze](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485789-blood-borne-ooze) lurks in the pool. The naiad wants nothing more than it to be gone. She will do her best to push or drag a party member into the pool, after which they will be attacked. 

The ooze was carried here by an explorer years ago, and cannot feast on the naiad.

#### The Waterfall and Pool
The waterfall cascades from a source hidden in the darkness above, flows through the room, and exits via a tunnel. 

A blood borne ooze hides in the pool, looking like nothing more than a discolored smudge. If any creature enters the water, besides the naiad, it will attempt to attack and feast. 

If the blood borne ooze is defeated, the naiad will not object to the party recovering the treasure from her pool - this, to her, is also mortal contamination. 

Two explorers have died in this pool:
- A human ranger, long ago
- A human bandit fleeing justice who carried the blood borne ooze, a year or two ago

The following treasure can be found:
- The bandit's purse. The leather has rotted away, but the following contents can be recovered: 21 gp, 93 sp, 366 cp, a heavy silver signet ring set with a stylized valley between two mountains with an oak tree in the middle, a silver brooch set with small pearls around a knot work design with the same mountain/oak motif in the middle, and a garnet solitaire ring made of gold and set with a single large garnet. The metal is tarnished but can easily be polished. 
- Three ivory dice.
- A rusted breastplate, two rusted daggers, a rusted long hunting knife, and what look like the rusted remains of a dozen or more arrowheads. None are worth anything, but the naiad will insist these be removed.
- A disintegrated scroll case; the parchment inside has rotted away.  
- A strange [lantern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2188385-lantern-of-tracking-fey) that seems oddly intact, although unlit
- A corroded silver arm band, and 39 corroded silver coins (Sembaran, but 100 years old)
- A small gold amulet, in the shape of a wand with a subtle heart shape. This is a holy symbol of the Sibyl. Has a prayer, in Sembaran, that seems to be a prayer for safety in battle ("Sibyl, keep the Warlord's eyes on me as I face danger"). A unique design, not like anything you've seen before. 

#### Move On

- The party can proceed to area C2 by following the stream through the sinkhole.
- Climbing up beside the waterfall could lead to unexplored areas above (at the DM's discretion).
- Returning to previous areas like C1 is also possible.
- Caution is advised as the noise from the waterfall may mask approaching dangers.

### C4: Hatchery

*This small cavern is filled with humidity from a bubbling pool of hot mud. Piles of cockatrice eggs line the edges of the cave, home to ten cockatrice hatchlings and one slightly larger cockatrice. As you enter, you witness a statue of a shepherd boy against the far wall suddenly turn back to flesh, only to be swarmed by the hatchlings and petrified once more.*

#### Set the Scene

- The room is dark; the characters need a light source to see
- A bubbling pool of hot mud fills the cavern, creating a warm and humid atmosphere.
- The sound of bubbling mud and chirping hatchlings echoes throughout the chamber.
- Steam from the hot mud slightly obscures vision.
- Piles of cockatrice eggs are scattered along the cave's edges.
- A statue of a shepherd boy stands against the far wall.

#### Call to Action
- Unless the characters have made significant noise, they likely won't be noticed immediately. 
- Any movement towards the cockatrice hatchlings or the eggs will provoke an angry attack
- The cockatrices will run around in a panic if the adult is killed or if more than half their number are killed. 
- Any attack will attract the attention of the fey cockatrice in area C5, who will appear at the beginning of round 6. If the characters defeat everyone in this room, they may have a chance to hide. 
- **Any creature that enters the hot mud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.**
#### The Boy

The boy appears to be a local shepherd who wandered into the cave. A **Wisdom (Medicine) DC 12** check confirms that he is petrified. If the characters have the means to cure petrification (such as **greater restoration**), they can restore him. He will also revive in 12 hours on his own. 

His name is Giles, and he is from a nearby village called Kilrath. He is very scared, having been repeatedly petrified over the past week, but he is too big for the cockatrice hatchling to eat. 

#### Eggs

The eggs can be collected and might be valuable to Caradoc. The fey cockatrice in area C5 will prioritize attacks on anyone carrying cockatrice eggs. 

#### Move On

Exits from this cavern lead back to area C1 or deeper into the dungeon. Proceeding quietly may prevent attracting attention from the adult cockatrice in nearby areas. The party can choose to explore further or retrace their steps to previous areas.

### C5: Cavern of Frozen Fear

*This rough-walled cavern is the main lair of the cockatrice. Tall columns of stone rise to the rough ceiling, and a rune-decorated gateway of worked stone stands before the rock wall to the north, swirling with magical energy. As you enter, you notice a few statues of animals—some of sheep, a deer, small animals—scattered throughout the cavern.*

#### Set the Scene

» The cavern is dimly lit; the swirling energy from the fey gate casts eerie shadows.
» Tall stone columns provide ample hiding spots for creatures.
» Statues of sheep, deer, raccoons, and other wildlife are positioned randomly, some appearing frightened.
» Two podiums flank the gate, holding glowing crystals of violet and green. The green crystal has a large crack, sending intermittent pulses of arcane energy into the walls and floor.
» The air is thick with the smell of ozone and damp earth.
» Around the base of the gate, something sparkles catching the light

#### Call to Action
- If the party has made noise, the fey cockatrice is hiding behind some rubble. Otherwise, it is pecking aimlessly at a broken piece of a sheep statue.
- If the party detects the cockatrice, it will attack, flying out to attack and then misty stepping back into the shadows. 
- The cockatrice will fight to the death to protect its lair.

#### Fey-Touched Cockatrice

The fey-touched cockatrice, the central boss of this lair, resides here. Its proximity to the unseelie gate has twisted the creature's nature.

- **Stealthy Predator**: It has proficiency in the Stealth skill, giving it a **+3** modifier on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Fey Magic**: It can cast the **misty step** spell as a bonus action, no components required.
- **Challenge Rating**: 1 (200 XP).

**Tactics**

If it becomes aware of intruders, the cockatrice attempts to hide among the statues, flies out to attack its foes, and then uses **misty step** to return to the shadows. If the characters manage to sneak up on it, they find the cockatrice pecking at the leg of an undamaged statue of a deer.

The cockatrice has darkvision and prefers to fight in the dark. It will first attack any character holding a light source, attempting to extinguish it to hunt more effectively.

**Statues**
A character or a cockatrice can attempt to topple a statue onto a creature within 5 feet of the statue. Doing so requires an action and a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, and forces the targeted creature to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained under the statue (escape DC 12).

**Columns**
The two natural columns of stone within the cavern can be used as cover. Because the cockatrice hatchlings have trouble maintaining focus on other creatures, whenever a character goes out of sight behind a pillar, any hatchlings aware of the character immediately forget about them, and go off in search of other targets.

**Fey Energy**
Any creature that moves within 15 feet of the gate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** or take **3 (1d6) lightning damage**.

#### Investigating the Fey Gate

*Understanding the Gate*

- The fey gate is unstable, with chaotic energy arcing from the cracked green crystal.
- A **Intelligence (Arcana) DC 14** check reveals:
  - The gate was once a portal to the unseelie realms of the Feywild.
  - Repairing the cracked crystal could stabilize the gate or harness its energy. Destroying the crystal would close the gate forever. 

*Interacting with the Crystals*

- Adjusting or repairing the green crystal requires a **Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) DC 15** check. ***Improvise alternatives here. Acid, for example, can destroy the crystal completely.***
  - **Success**: The crystal stabilizes, reducing arcane pulses. Characters gain advantage on saving throws against the gate's lightning damage.
  - **Failure**: The crystal shatters, releasing a burst of energy. All creatures within 20 feet must make a **DC 13 Dexterity saving throw** or take **7 (2d6) lightning damage**.

*Treasure*

- The fey energy has turned some fragments of stone to gems. Can collect 5 gems with a little work: two malachite, two lapis lazuli, one obsidian, one pale blue quartz. None are polished. All common, inferior gems (2d6 x 5 gp each, divided by 2). 
#### Move On

- Exits lead back to previous areas like C4 or deeper into the cavern network.
- Interacting with the fey gate may open new pathways or adventures.
- Proceeding cautiously is advised due to potential arcane hazards and remaining cockatrice threats.

### C6: Rubbish Heap

(cleared)

This is a rubbish heap, where random bones are scattered. The fey energy has reanimated one - it will rise to attack, it's shadow attacking separately. No treasure.

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485996-shadow-mcdm
https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4486000-skeleton-mcdm

## Aftermath

Party should find Caradoc in Brantor to give him the cockatrice and get their reward.

Optional: have two darklings follow the party from the standing stones on their way back, and move to attack at night. 

### XP

There should be a total of 10 rewards so if they miss some they can still level up, and if they get everything they will have a boost on level 3. 

4.5 from hard rewards
2 from easy rewards
4 from standard rewards

1 easy, 1 standard, 1 hard guaranteed = 300 xp
2 standard almost guaranteed = 200 xp
(so should get a minimum of 500 xp - need 525 to level up)

undead in C6, fey king statue, a bit of exploration = 150 maybe
defeating the naiad is tough, as is closing the gate = 300 unlikely to get
