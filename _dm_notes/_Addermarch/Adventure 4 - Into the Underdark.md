## Setup

- Currently Sunday. Reintroduce Roscombe, the destruction of the serpentine dagger. Market day, if anyone wants to buy or sell anything. 
- Reintroduce inns, Caradoc:
	**_The Traveler's Rest._** The only inn in Roscombe, a well-built two story building against the wall, near the South Gate (where the road from Valcroix enters town). Run by Bertrand LeBlanc, charming middle-aged man, with a personal connection to the Traveler. Efficient and organized, and a decent cook as well.
	**_The Raven's Roost._** A popular tavern on the market square, where the locals hang out. Run by Madeline Brewer, a young woman, daughter of the old tavern keeper who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Madeline took over the family business and has been thriving. Known for their beer, and the primary brewer in town.

[[Caradoc]]

- Meet the party that evening at the Raven's Roost, as usual, for Caradoc comes to Roscombe every Sunday for the market and stays the night. 

## The Mission

Caradoc is pleased; the party has proven resourceful and skilled. Wonders if they are up for a more difficult challenge. 

There grows deep beneath the ground, in the dark tunnels where sun never shines, a strange kind of living rock, that can be harvested and used in alchemical recipes. Called uligium (oo-lee-ghee-um) by the scholars of Chardon and in the ancient texts, it is rare, but can be recognized as it will slowly ooze and flow towards heat, especially fire. Tends to look like a whitish patch on a wall. Be wary, for it will (slowly) grow over the unawares, if you happen to fall asleep nearby!

Will hand them three metal vials. Bring back as much as you can! Will pay 150 gold for each vial that you fill. Easiest way to harvest it is to pour some lamp oil in the bottom of a vial, and light it with a wick, and let the stone crawl into the flaming vial itself. 

There are many caves in the hills to the west, but most are shallow. The nearest deep cave Caradoc knows of is about 30 miles to the west, into the hills. 

## Adventure Outline

Part 1: reaching the cave
- about 15 miles over clear ground, and then 15 miles over difficult terrain into the hills, with no obvious paths. 
- over clear ground can move at up to a fast pace, and are passing through pastures and small villages, mostly. 
- the hills are at most a normal pace, and probably slower. use "hill" terrain for navigation and search DCs

Part 2: entrance
- this is an ogre lair, and need to fight or otherwise distract / deal with the ogre to pass through into the deeper parts of the cavern

Part 3: deep caves
- tbd

## Part 1: Travel

https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Hazards

Possible encounters/obstacles:
- In the pastureland, might run into people. Improvise, etc. 
- in the hills, could run into monsters

#### Ankheg

An ankheg has recently emerged from hibernation in the pasturelands, and has killed several animals already. 

Might run into shepherds going to ask for help from Lady Eowen.
Might run into desolate dairy farmers whose cow was killed and eaten.

https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485772-ankheg-mcdm

#### Hills

Random encounters. Roll 1d6. 

1-2. A predator on the hunt. Either an [owlbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4485976-owlbear-mcdm), at dusk, or a pack of four dire [wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775812-dire-wolf) during the day. Both will press the attack on one individual, seeking to knock them out and drag them away, but will flee if seriously threatened. Start Hostile, and start from an Ambush if possible. 

3-4. A hermit named Norman. Old man, tangled hair, a little crazy. On a walk collecting food. Doesn't like people, starts Indifferent bordering on Hostile. "Hey what are you doing in these hills? My hills!" But if get him to talk, can tell them about the cave. "Stay away from there, big big big man, always hungry." He is compassionate but also rather impulsive and tactless. 

5-6. (Only while traveling, not at rest). Giant insect territory. Either two [wasp swarms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4486013-swarm-of-insects-mcdm) (add 30 foot fly speed and change attack to sting, doing 2d4 piercing + 2d6 poison, or 1d4 piercing + 1d6 poison) with four [giant wasps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16898-giant-wasp), or two [spider  swarms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4486015-swarm-of-spiders-mcdm) with two [giant spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775821-giant-spider). Will fight to the death to defend their territory, but will not chase retreating characters outside territory. Give a chance to detect territory. For spiders, territory has [webs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Webs); for wasps, territory has [razorvine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Razorvine)

Finding the cave: requires a search, using survival. DC 15, failure means spend 8 hours fruitlessly hunting, but can try again in the morning.  Consider running random encounter during search, and having ogre be alert? 

## Part 2: Entrance Cave

The entrance to the deeps is a large open cavern that is now used by an ogre as his lair. The ogre has a nasty pile of straw and leaves as a bed; a smoky area with a giant iron cookpot over a fire; and a pen for his two dogs. There is the rotting carcass of a cow near the fire. 

[Ogre](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/fm/creatures-ls#Ogre)
[Dogs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/fm/creatures-ad#Bears) (use Little Bear stat block with Powerful Jaw and Fearsome Growl traits)

Combat:
1x ogre
1x dog

Ogre will attempt to surrender if reduced below 50% HP; dogs will try to flee if reduced below 50% HP, but ogre might attempt to stop them. 

Ogre cavern has a 20' by 20' entrance, stretches 60' back. 

There are also scattered pieces of treasure, although finding them all requires a DC 15 Perception check:
- 10 scattered silver trade bars (1 lb each, worth 5 gp each)
- A decorated silver ewer, engraved with dancing satyrs (25 gp)
- Two barrels of good winter apples (5 sp per barrel)
- A bolt of good cotton cloth, undyed (about 100 square yards = 500 sp)
- A small gilded bracelet (25 gp)

At the end of the ogre lair, a narrow passage (too narrow for the ogre) drops about 150 feet with several ledges to a wide cavern, which provides the entrance to the deep section. 

## Part 3: The Deeps

## Resting in the Deeps



## Deeps Map
![[Caverns Map]]

## Deeps Room Descriptions
### Room 1

Entry passage. Vertical descent. 70', then a ledgy area, then 80'.
### Room 2 (Uligium)

First chamber. Large, dry ("rotunda" vibe). 
Three exits: wide, high ceiling passage to the southwest; narrow crawlspace to the south; wide, low passage to the southeast. 

Crawlspace leads to patch of **uligium**. 

A large ogre skeleton lies in the middle of the chamber. Will stand and attack anyone who enters - was killed by ogre above who took the lair. Will reanimate each night until the ogre above is killed, after which it will not reanimate once destroyed. 

[Ogre Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/782427-ogre-skeleton)
### Room 3

Passageway descends to a pit that drops seemingly endlessly into darkness. If they really press on here, improvise but should be a pretty difficult descent into great danger. 
### Room 4

Large open corridor, some boulders along the sides but generally an open and easy passage. No combats, no hazards. Slopes down

### Room 5

Slopes gently up. Becomes very narrow, although tall. 

### Room 6

Opens abruptly into a giant pit, about 20 foot in diameter. No hazards other than the pit. 

### Room 7

Four [piercers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17191-piercer) lurk on the ceiling above the intersection here. Will immediately drop on anyone moving below. 

West passage leads to a pit that drops down to area 10. 

### Room 8

Huge open room, the back (south-ish) wall collapsed and filled with rubble. A passage beyond, but basically impossible to reach. Bits of glowing luminescence in the rubble, but whether algae/fungi or crystal is hard to see. 

The rubble is unstable: attempts to shift it causes small avalanche of stones, DC 12 Dex saving throw or 1d6 bludgeoning damage. 


### Room 9 (Uligium)

A small cavern reached by a narrow crawspace, with no entrances or exits. 

Three [gray oozes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16909-gray-ooze) lurk here near the Uligium.

### Room 10

Unremarkable chamber. Active cave formations. 

### Room 11

Unremarkable chamber. Active cave formations. 

### Room 12

Unremarkable chamber. Active cave formations. Fungi are cultivated by the kobold as a potential warning. 

**Spore Cloud Fungi**: A cluster of delicate fungal growths releases a puff of harmless but choking spores when disturbed. Creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spores. Anyone who fails glows with a faint light for 1 hour, giving them disadvantage on Stealth and all attacks against them have Advantage

### Room 13 (Uligium)

This small chamber is reached only by a crawlspace, which requires a DC 13 Perception check to notice. Can only be traversed  by a Small creature. 

[Poisonous Gas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#PoisonousGas) leaks into this chamber from a crack below, and pools here in a high and dangerous concentration. 
### Room 14

Unremarkable chamber. Could add a [Gelatinous Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16869-gelatinous-cube) patrolling along here and room 15 if desired, controlled and fed by the kobold.

**14A**:

This small passage has a series of rat pens, with pretty fat rats in them. 

Surrounded by poison mushrooms: use pseudodragon ability here.
Bad smelling odor from poison mushrooms. 
Also a tripwire on each side that triggers a loud fall of rubble (DC 13 Dex saving throw, restrained and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage on failure, requires DC 13 Strength check to escape, disadvantage if small).
### Room 15

See above. 

### Room 16 (Uligium)

A chasm separates a deep pool from the rest of the cave system. Three [darkmantles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16837-darkmantle) lurk on the ceiling above the cave, and will ambush anyone trying to cross the water or reach the Uligium.

### Room 17

Dead end - rubble. However, there is a strange fungus garden here. 

- Neatly cultivated patches of glowing mushrooms, separated into categories (food, alchemy, illumination).
- Handwritten wooden signs stuck in the ground with labels like "DO NOT EAT (UNLESS DESPERATE)."

[Shriekers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17013-shrieker) at the entrance alert Zibzik to intruders. 

**Glowing Warding Runes**: Small, glowing runes carved into the walls around the garden emit a faint hum when approached, which gets faster and faster as you approach. Ultimately does nothing except say "Go away, these are mine!"

### Room 18

River runs through here. 

[Green Slime](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#GreenSlime) drips from the ceiling where the river enters and oozes along the wall here. 

A [Cave Fisher](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560751-cave-fisher) lurks in a hidden nook in the ceiling (DC 15 Perception to spot), with its filament dangling over the entrance to the room (DC 17 Perception check to spot; otherwise first person in line blunders into it). Cave fisher will run if seriously hurt, trying to hide in the darkness of the ceiling. 

Drawn up on the shore is a crude raft and there is an area that is carved out where water pools and can be draw up with a bucket. 
### Room 19 (Uligium)

A wide open, slippery flowstone drops to the river. Requires a DC 12 Dex saving throw or slip into the river, potentially getting washed into room 18 and the cave fisher's line. 

Uligium here is on the opposite side of the river, on the wall. 

### Room 20 **Cooking/Living Space and Laboratory**

**Description:**  
This room is a chaotic mix of practicality and eccentricity. The air is warm and slightly acrid, carrying the smells of fungus stew and alchemical experiments. A crude firepit sits in one corner, surrounded by pots, scavenged utensils, and a bundle of dried herbs. The rest of the space is dominated by cluttered shelves and tables laden with oddities—half-finished magical contraptions, bottles of glowing liquids, and piles of notes written in Zibzik’s scratchy Draconic.

**Details:**

1. **Firepit and Cooking Supplies**:
    
    - A small ring of carefully arranged stones holds a low-burning fire fueled by dried fungus logs.
    - A bubbling pot hangs from a makeshift tripod, filled with a thick, greenish stew of unknown origin.
    - Nearby, neatly stacked wooden bowls, spoons, and crude metal knives suggest Zibzik prides himself on his cooking.
2. **Shelves and Tables**:
    
    - Shelves are crammed with mismatched jars containing strange ingredients: powdered lichen, dried river slime, crushed crystals, and something that looks suspiciously like eyeballs.
    - A table in the center of the room serves as his workspace, strewn with half-built magical devices, including a rudimentary wand that occasionally sparks with static.
    - Crumpled scrolls with failed spell formulas lie in a pile on the floor.
3. **Decorations and Oddities**:
    
    - Small clay figurines of dragons, kobolds, and other creatures are arranged on a shelf like trophies.
    - A glowing rock hangs from the ceiling, tied with string, acting as a makeshift lamp.
    - A crude mural painted on the wall depicts Zibzik blasting an enormous foe with a beam of magic while a crowd of adoring kobolds cheers in the background.


### Room 21 **Bedroom**

**Description:**  
The bedroom is surprisingly tidy compared to the rest of the lair, though it still reflects Zibzik’s quirky personality. A low cot made of woven fungus stalks sits against one wall, draped with mismatched blankets and pelts. The room has a peaceful air, with glowing mushrooms in small jars providing soft, ambient light. A locked chest and a collection of shiny trinkets hint at his private treasures.

**Details:**

1. **Sleeping Area**:
    
    - The cot is lined with fungus padding and covered with colorful pelts—some scavenged, some dyed with natural pigments.
    - A lumpy, misshapen pillow stuffed with moss and animal fur sits at the head of the cot.
    - At the foot of the bed, a small clay dragon figurine serves as a "guardian" of his dreams.
2. **Personal Treasures**:
    
    - A locked chest reinforced with scraps of iron contains his most prized possessions, including rare alchemical ingredients, a few gold pieces, and a tattered book of spells he can barely read.
    - On a low shelf, Zibzik has arranged shiny objects collected from the river, including coins, shards of glass, and polished stones. Each is labeled in Draconic with whimsical names like “Star Stone” or “The Shiniest Thing.”
3. **Other Touches**:
    
    - A small "warding circle" is scratched into the floor with chalk, surrounded by tiny dragon statues. He believes it keeps bad dreams away.
    - Several small jars with glowing mushrooms and bioluminescent moss provide light. One jar is decorated with crude drawings of stars and labeled “Zibzik’s Night Light.”
    - A stack of old kobold clan tokens sits under the cot, hidden but not discarded, showing he still holds some attachment to his past.

## Kobold Wizard

**Zibzig Sparkscale**

#### **Personality and Roleplaying Tips**

- **Eccentric and Grandiose**: Zibzig constantly refers to himself in the third person and exaggerates his achievements. "Behold! The brilliance of Zibzig, Master of Light and Shadow!"
- **Skittish but Curious**: He’s wary of outsiders but cannot resist showing off his magical creations or asking invasive questions about the surface world.
- **Inventive and Resourceful**: Always fiddling with small contraptions or sketching runes in the dirt. He mutters to himself about “theoretical combustive resonance” and other arcane nonsense.
- **Emotionally Complex**: He’s proud of his independence but sometimes lonely, leading to mixed reactions to visitors—both suspicion and excitement.
- **Speech Quirks**: Talks rapidly, often mixing Draconic words with Common. Throws in sound effects ("POOF!") to emphasize his points.
#### **Desires and Goals**

**Annoyed because cave fisher just moved in, and is preventing him from using the river**

- **Recognition**: Zibzik wants to prove he’s more than a raiding kobold—he dreams of being remembered as a great wizard or alchemist in some grand tome.
- **Self-Sufficiency**: He left his clan to escape the endless cycle of raiding, but he’s determined to show he can thrive on his own.
- **Creation of a "Perfect Spell"**: Zibzik is obsessed with inventing a signature spell that will make him famous. He might ask for input or test early (chaotic) prototypes on visitors.
