## Premise

Basic premise is that Cha'mutte won, finding a way to kill all the [[Embodied Gods]], and likely in the process somehow destroying the mechanism by which divine magic works / incorporeal gods grant prayers. 

Basic vibe is Arcane, with chalyte functioning as Hextech. 

Maybe Cha'mutte still dies in the end, sacrificing himself; his death this time leaves scars of crystalized chaos as well, generating a second kind of magic gemstone. 

The vibe is steampunk, with no electricity, but with gunpowder (or gunpowder analogs anyway, maybe made with the chaos gemstone), airships, and steam engines used to mass produce chalyte powder, etc. 

Consequences:
- Elves and Lizardfolk cannot survive without their Firstborn magic, and are extinct
- Orcs are free of Thark, so everone is a "Free Orc" (DND 2024 5e rules)
- Dwarves, Halflings, and Stoneborn potentially survive, radically changed (use DND 2024 5e rules, not Taelgar rules)
	- Halflings no longer have silent speech, or ancestral mind. 
	- Dwarves no longer have thuhr, or runic magic
	- Stoneborn (Goliath) cannot survive in the mountains without magic, and have descended to lower elevations, possibly if anything more common
- Clerics and paladins don't exist (or if they do, draw power from a handful of surviving relics, not prayer)
