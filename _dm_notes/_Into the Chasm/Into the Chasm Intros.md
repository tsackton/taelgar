**For as long as anyone remembers, the Great Chasm has split Zimkova like a wound—an impossible cleft that plunges into endless depths, from which strangeness emerges: spires of impossible buildings, unexpected lights, storms and winds that seem to defy gravity, and unusual and unseasonable plants. 

Although many see it as the home of Zeyfa, the cruel west wind of the Zimkovan legends, not all do: the kenku monks of the Kemeko Monastery see it as a place of safety and refuge, and the mystics of the Vejo Vaikai believe the Chasm is a place of elemental balance.

The summer of 1729 in Zimkova started fine and fair, but by late August, rumors of an orcish horde lead by a fearsome orc calling herself the Ravager of Winter, had started to spread across Breva. In early September the news came: a great battle had been fought north of the Great Chasm between the dwarves of Nidzahar, apparently aided by a large contingent of Stoneborn, and the orcish horde. The Ravager was killed, and the bulk of the orcs were defeated - but scattered bands fled south to Breva like angry wasps, and the Mezhai – the woodswalkers – and many others were kept busy defending the people.

And so few noticed as the first signs of the Chasm changing. A summer thunderstorm, thick and warm, burst forth in October. But this had happened before, although rarely. A sandstorm, thick and dry, with scorching heat, in November. A boulder of volcanic stone, aflame with green fire, which tumbled down the southern rapids and floated all the way to the Green Sea was remarked upon as mighty strange. 

In December, a rainbow appeared that stretched across the sky and a day later, shattered into hundreds of thousands of shards of glass was widely seen as an omen - but few could agree on what it meant. When that rainbow sign was followed by a living sheet of ice that drifted down the Teft like a predator, leaving dead fish and frozen banks in its wake, many across Breva began to believe Zeyfa was angry.

At the start of January, the sky above the Chasm turned black, and held, blotting out the sun, for five days and nights. And so on January 8th, two weeks before Quintarum, the Sembaran feast day of the Wanderer, the Vejo Vaikai gathered some of their wisest mystics, and sent them, protected by the warriors of Kemeko, to investigate.

It is now January 25th. More than two weeks have passe and none have returned from the Chasm.


EOLO & EKKO INTRO

Eolo, you have traveled far from your homeland—following old stories of the Kemeko, those kenku monks who dwell on the sheer cliffs of the Great Chasm, dancing with the winds. You traveled south through the Sentinels and across Zimkova asking after the Kemeko. Although kenku are not unheard of here, few are used to interacting with them, and the Kemeko – although not a secret – is not well-known. Questions about the Great Chasm bring mostly muttered curses and warnings about the cruel west wind, Zefya.

But you learn of a group of mystics, the Vejo Vaikai, who live in the forests of Breva, along the banks of the Selgrava (SELL-grah-vah) before it joins the Teft. Arriving there, you found worry carved into every face.

There, you met Ekko—a fellow kenku, but unlike you, he carries the weather of the Chasm in his feathers. Raised at Kemeko, now walking with the Vejo Vaikai, he knows its storms, its moods, its long silences. And he fears what has begun.

Ekko, the weeks of waiting for your mentor Eidrikas (AYD-ree-kahs) to return from the Chasm have been hard, and your worry has been growing. Despite the advice of the remaining elders, you long to go after him.

When Eolo arrives - earnest, confident, certain that travel to the monastery is safe - you agree to accompany him, and the two of you set out on the winter morning of January 23nd, flying across the frozen winter landscape, towards Kemeko, which you hope to reach in two days.

ICE STORM

As you fly side by side, across the winter landscape, you watch the Chasm. It is calm tonight, and you are looking for a place to camp before the final push to Kemeko tomorrow.

But then you hear a sound rising, like the noise of icebergs crashing and you see clouds begin to thicken over the Chasm. Shards of ice begin to drift upward from the Chasm—upward, against gravity—spinning faster and faster. Before you can react, the storm explodes around you, a tornado of snow and ice, and you are buffeted left, right, up, down. The sky tilts: up and down have no meaning, and you are surrounded by a whiteness so complete as to be like darkness. The wind howls louder, and you feel your wings straining, breaking. You fold into a ball and fall into the Chasm.

 JUSTAS & FINNAN INTRO

After an unexpected fall of hunting orcs, Justas and Finnan, you are wintering in the small village of Dravnieki (DRAHV-nyeh-kee) on the banks of the upper Teft. The village was attacked twice by orcs, and you are here in part as a favor to the village elders, as added protection in case more dangers come out of the winter. Other than the rumors around the Chasm, it has been a quiet winter, although you wonder about the omens, and think maybe a journey to the Chasm would be interesting, come spring.

But the black sky above the Chasm, visible even here, seventy-five miles away, changed your plans. None in Dravieki or the surrounding villages dared head north, but you felt a pull - perhaps a memory of the halflings, or the whisper of the kestavo, or perhaps just your curiosity and sense of duty to the people of Zimka. Either way, by January 10th you had gathered supplies and started the trek north. In the winter forests 10 miles a day would be making good time, and you didn’t always make good time. But by January 22nd, you’ve reached the outflow, where the Teft spills out of the Chasm, and are making your way along the edge towards Kemeko, when you receive a message from Jrain, your friend and woodswalker.

A mysterious woman, speaking only Old Zimkovan, and terrified of being near the Chasm or speaking to the monks of Kemeko, has emerged from the Chasm, and Jrain is bringing her to you to see if you can understand her and decipher her story.

You agree to meet them in two days time - January 24th - at a well-known campsite along the north side of the Chasm.

JRAIN INTO

The fall was tiring, with much toing-and-froing across the forest of Breva hunting orcs. And so you hoped to spend the winter in peace. But in late December, you got word from the Vejo Vaikai that an expedition into the Chasm was being planned, and they asked if you and your bird-messengers could come to Kemeko to help coordinate. 

And so you were at Kemeko when the day turned to night and the darkness from the Chasm blotted out the sky, and you watched Eidrikas (AYD-ree-kahs) of the Vejo Vaikai and the kenku Pakrinek of Kemeko and their companions soared down into the depths. Your birds watched as they descended, and at first, their care and caution seemed to be paying off. But a week and a half ago, you woke to a feeling of searing pain, and just caught a hint of a stormcloud of superheated steam spreading through the Chasm. It reached the top only has fog and mist, but now you can only watch and wait with the others, hoping Eidrikas and his companions avoided the fate of your birds. 

Two days ago - January 22nd – a woman— (who you later learned was named Kalima)--an Old Zimka speaker from a culture thought long gone—staggered out of the Chasm, terrified, half-frozen, unable to speak with the monks. No one knows how she survived, or why she came.
 
Thinking of Justas and Finnan - speakers of her language, and talented at calming fears and untangling stories - you sent your birds to ask them to come north to Kemeko to help untangle this mystery. Fearing every day might matter, and discovering they were already on their way, you collected the mysterious woman and set out from Kemeko to meet them and see if they can untangle her mystery.

You agree to meet them in two days time - January 24th - at a well-known campsite along the north side of the Chasm.

 ICE STORM

As you greet Jrain and the mysterious woman, and before you have exchanged more than a few words, you hear a howling from the Chasm. A sound rises, the howl of icebergs crashing and snow swirling. The clouds above twist into a spiral, lightless and cold. Shards of ice begin to drift upward from the Chasm—upward, against gravity—spinning faster and faster until the air becomes a storm of hail and ice, and you can see no more than 10 feet from you.

Before you can react, the storm explodes around you, a tornado of snow and ice, and you are lifted from the ground. The sky tilts, or the wind takes you: up and down have no meaning, and you are surrounded by a whiteness so complete as to be like darkness.

KALIMA STORY NOTES

Her people have been here for seven by seven by seven generations, and the west wind demands a sacrifice each sunset.
