**Characters: Riswynn, Oskar, **Keno-To**

> Ken-To (Played by Isaac)
> Stoneborn monk who lives in Yuvanti peaks.

Three weeks ago, an unusual comet crashed into the mountains above the monastery of the Stoneborn in the mountain peaks west and above Tharn Todor.
 
A cloud of black smoke and ash now hangs over the mountain, and you have had dreams of a fire spreading from the mountain and consuming the land below, and a red hand reaching up from cracks in the ground.
 
A few days ago, a wounded deva staggered down the mountain, warning you of a ritual to summon a servant of an ancient evil from beyond this world.
 
Unprepared to tackle the challenge alone, you left the deva in your hermit's hut and sought help in Tharn Todor.
 
## Notes

One week after end of the Chuul adventure this starts.
 
## Deva Battle
 
Returning to Ken-to's hut, the wounded deva is being attacked by magma mephits and two spined devils.
 
## Mountain Paths
 
NOTES: two goats; seems confused initially and won't attack, seem skittish and blocking the path though and if they approach too close will attack.
 
Lingering snow, not fresh snow. Narrow path up.
 
Instead of glyph, a smear of ash in the form of a symbol that does not seem to quite stay still.
 
If they get ash off then will "revert".
