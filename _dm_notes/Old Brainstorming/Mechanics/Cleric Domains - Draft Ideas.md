Doing a little brainstorming linking Cleric Domains to particular deities, both for humans and non-human races. Focusing on the "major" PC races (humans, halflings, dwarves, lizardfolk, goliath, elves).
 
Ultimately would like to have the following:

1. All the standard PHB/XGtE domains are linked to Eightfold Way deities
2. Non-human races have a subset of the standard PHB/XGtE domains based on racial traits, and linked to firstborn; may also have some additional "race-specific domains" either from UA/SCAG/GGtR or to be homebrewed
3. Non-Drankorian cultures act like other races, having access to most but not all of the standard PHB/XGtE domains, plus something extra?
 
Basically some thing seem off, like a Trickery domain Goliath or a Nature domain dwarf…need to think a little about this. Probably would help to have non-Drankorian religions a bit more fleshed out first

**FOR HUMANS**
 
The "dominant" religious tradition of the Eightfold Way, common and popular in former Drankorian territories:
 
**The Mother (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)**
 
Life, [Knowledge?]
 
**The Father (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)**
 
Light, [Protection?], [War?]
 
**The Night Queen (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)**
 
Grave, [Twilight?]
 
**The Warlord (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)**
 
War, Forge
 
**The Sibyl (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty)**
 
Knowledge, [Arcana?]
 
**The Wanderer (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)**
 
Trickster, [Tempest?], [Knowledge?]
 
**The Wyrdling (genderless deity of chaos, luck, fate, and storms)**
 
Tempest, [Trickster?]
 
**The Wilding (genderless deity of nature and elements)**
 
Nature, [Tempest?], [Light?]
   

**FOR DWARVES**
 
Dwarves are pretty diverse, albeit perhaps not quite as diverse as humans. They do not have access to Nature domain
 
**Warrior**
 
War
 
**Stoneworker**
 
Forge
 
**Traveler**
 
Trickster
 
**Farmer**
 
Life, Grave?
 
**Rune-Caster**
 
Knowledge
 
**Ruler**
 
_Order_
 
**Priest**
 
Tempest, Light
 
**FOR GOLIATH**
 
Entamba is just one firstborn/god. Goliath nature lends itself well to Tempest, Life, Forge, War, probably Nature, maybe
