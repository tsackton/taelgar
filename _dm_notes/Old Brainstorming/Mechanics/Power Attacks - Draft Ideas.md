Interesting discussion on Reddit here re: GWM/SS: [https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/p1h54s/martials_without_gwmpam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/3d6/comments/p1h54s/martials_without_gwmpam/)
 
I find the feat tax of GWM/SS kind of annoying, but as both main campaigns get into Tier 2 / Tier 3 want martials to keep up.
 
Probably the easiest solution is to introduce Martial Maneuvers as free things that you can do, then drop the damage part of GWM and SS and add +1 Str to GWM and +1 Dex to SS.
 
Options would be something like:
 
Power Strike: when you attack with a martial weapon that you are proficient in that has the heavy property, you can choose to make a power strike. You take -PB penalty to hit, but do +2xPB damage on a ht.
 
Headshot: when you attack with a martial ranged weapon that you are proficient in, you can make a targeted shot at a vulnerable part of your enemy. You take -PB penalty to hit, but do +2xPB damage on a ht.
 
Not sure about restricting to martial weapons vs restricting to certain classes. Also kinda leaves monks and sword+board fighters out? Polearm types still have polearm master as an option. I guess sword+board could have shield master and let them make a bonus action before Attack.
