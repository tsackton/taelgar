Lifestyle Costs:
 
- If you choose to do a downtime activity, you need to pay lifestyle costs for the time you are spending on downtime.
- If you don't engage in downtime, it is assumed that you carry out odd jobs and other small tasks to pay for a modest lifestyle with no associated costs
- Lifestyle costs per day: 1-2 sp (squalid, poor); 1 gp (modest); 2 gp (comfortable); 4 gp (wealthy); 10+ gp (aristocratic)
 
Options:
 
- Some choices have prerequisites, either in terms of fame/access, or specific connections. Others will be more difficult or have reduced benefits without access to particular connections.
- Other choices may have consequences for the reputation of the character. Characters who acquire a reputation for lawlessness in particular will likely be kicked out of the Great Library
 
Resolving Downtime:
 
- Decide what you want to do, and roll an appropriate skill check. There may also be a chance of a complication. The DM will tell you whether you gain the desired benefit, or if something happens (good or bad).
