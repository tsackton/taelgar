Monks of the Way of the Third Eye follow a tradition that teaches them to align their ki with flow of extraplanar energy through the world, allowing them to see things others cannot. These monks learn to see what is hidden, and perceive the flow of time to allow glimpses of the past and the future.
 
As a monk of the Way of the Third Eye, you gain the following benefits.
 
**3rd level**
 
_Sense Aura._ As a bonus action, you can spend 2 ki points to perceive the aura of one creature within 60 feet that you can see. This effect lasts for 1 hour, or until your Concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The effect ends early if the target dies. While the effect is active, you gain the following benefits:

- While you can see the target, you know if it’s under the effect of any magical or psionic effects, its current hit point total, and its basic emotional state.
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma checks you make against it
- You always know the target's location.
- When you hit the target with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 additional ki to do an extra 1d10 psychic damage.
 
_Aural Echoes_. You are attuned to auras and the echoes they leave behind. When you meditate on an item for 10 minutes, you gain a faint impression of its history and purpose. If it is magical, you learn that. You also learn a short phrase or sentence describing something about the history or purpose of the item. In addition, you can expend ki for additional effects:

- For 2 ki, you can cast the _Identify_ spell on this item
- For 3 ki, you can perceive a moment in the past from the perspective of the item. While you can attempt to guide your vision to a specific time, the exact moment you perceive will be determined by the time that left the strongest aural echo on the item.
 
**6th level**
 
_Enhanced Senses._ You can extend your perception around you. As an action, you can expend 1 ki to search for auras within 60 feet of you. This perception can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature this way, you can use your Sense Aura ability without having to see the target.
 
You can also use this ability to cast the following spells using ki: _darkvision_ (targeting self only, 1 ki), _see invisibility_ (3 ki), or _locate object_ (3 ki).
 
_Improved Aura Sense_. While you are perceiving the aura of another creature, you can use an action and expend 1 ki to cast _detect thoughts_ on that creature. This ability does not require concentration, but if your Sense Aura effect ends, it ends as well.
 
**11th level**
 
_Shield Aura_. You can shield your aura, protecting yourself from scrying and divination. You can cast the _nondetection_ spell for 3 ki.
 
_Cleanse Aura_. You can cleanse negative affects affecting others. As a ritual requiring 10 minutes of meditation, you expend 5 ki while touching a creature. You sense if the creature is suffering from any curses or magical effects, and can choose to remove all curses affecting the creature and dispel magical effects affecting that creature of 4th level or lower. For each magical effect of 5th level or higher, make a Wisdom ability check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. You can choose to remove the effect on a successful check.
   

**17th level**
 
_Aura Search._ You can cast your mind through the Plane of Consciousness to find others and perceive the world from a different vantage point. Using this ability, you can expend your ki to cast the following spells: _locate creature_ (5 ki), _scrying_ (6 ki), or _clairvoyance_ (4 ki).
 
_Truesight_. Your senses are completely attuned to the Plane of Consciousness. You can perceive auras around you without effort, and can now use your _Sense Aura_ ability without expending ki (although you can only focus on a single aura at a time). In addition, you can use this ability and expend 7 ki to cast _true seeing_.
