_“If we were to dwell forever in Arat’s domain, spend eternity in Their bosom, we would grow weary of existence, and wish to end it. Ours are short, fiery, but quick lives, and we must accept that."_  
—Saint Mordan, quoted in the Scrolls of the Divine
 
Humans are one of the younger races in Taelgar, late to arrive and make their mark, and shorter lived than the Elder races. Yet, they spread like wildfire, full of drive and ambition. Humans are by far the most numerous inhabitants in the lands of Taelgar, building mighty empires, trading across vast distances, and settling in every corner of the land. Unlike most other races in Taelgar, humans do not have a special connection to any part of the land; without a homeland, they make their home everywhere.

## Human Traits
 
Humans are the consummate generalists, and as such have a lot of flexibility in their skills, traits, and backgrounds. Your human character has these traits.
 
**Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice increases by 1. Alternatively, increase three ability scores of your choice by 1.  
**Age**. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.  
**Alignment**. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.  
**Size**. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.  
**Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  
**Versatility**. You gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice.  
**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write three [languages](Languages). One of these must be a trade tongue, and the second must be the native tongue of your homeland or the area you grew up. The third language can be any of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
 
As a human, you are more versatile than other races. Unlike most other races, your subrace is not a property of your ancestry and heritage, but rather reflects the diverse gifts you were born with. You may choose one of the following paths, either of which allows you a choice of additional benefits:
 
### Path of Training

Humans are quick learners, you more so than most. You may have devoted years to perfecting a particular discipline, or you may be a generalist with wide interests. This could represent formal education, or training gained from experience as a wanderer, merchant, solider, pit fighter, or anything else you can imagine. If you choose the path of training, you have a prodigious ability to pick up new skills. You may select one of the following traits:
 
1. **Exceptional Versatility:** You gain one additional skill proficiency of your choice, one tool proficiency of your choice, and fluency in one language of your choice.
2. **Polyglot:** You learn three additional languages, and gain the ability to create codes and ciphers. Your codes can be broken by magic or by a successful Intelligence check against a DC of your Intelligence score plus your Proficiency bonus.
3. **Weapon Training:** You gain proficiency with four weapons of your choice.
4. Alternatively, you make select one feat from the **Feats for Skills** table, giving you proficiency or expertise in a particular skill. You gain all benefits of this feat except for any associated ability score increase.
 
### Path of Grit

Humans are not the strongest, faster, nimblest, smartest, or wisest race, but they have grit in spades. If you choose the path of grit, you are hard to keep down. You may select one of the following traits:
 
1. **Human Determination**: When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
2. **Human Resilience:** Choose one ability score. You gain proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.
3. **Human Endurance:** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
4. **Fit of Mind and Body:** Three ability scores of your choice increase by 1 each. These cannot be ability scores you increased with your base ASI feature.
 
### Path of Talent

Some humans are born with a natural affinity for certain skills. If you choose the path of talent, you are a natural talent in a particular area. You may select one of the following traits:
 
1. **Athlete:** When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement. In addition, climbing doesn’t halve your speed, and you can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
2. **Actor:** You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. In addition, you can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
3. **Observant:** If you can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips. You have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.
4. **Keen Mind:** You always know which way is north. You always know the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset. You can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
