Some way to show health on tokens. Either bar without numbers, or a status indicator (bruised, bloodied, wounded, near death).

Spells with costly material components don't require them (this is a stupid gold tax that is totally irrelevant anyway because I can just give you less gold, so what is the point of me adding 500 gp of treasure to somewhere and have it immediately spent on components).
 
**HOWEVER**, spells with consumed material components still require you to provide the consumed material component.
