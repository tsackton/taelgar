Monks of the Way of the Awakened Mind follow a tradition that teaches them to align their ki with the flow of extraplanar energy from the Plane of Consciousness that permeates the world, manipulating this energy through force of will. These monks can extend their perception into realms others cannot see, learn to channel this extraplanar energy into physical force, and even step between dimensions.
 
**3rd level**
 
_Soul Sight._ When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you become attuned to the auras that surround all conscious creatures. As an action, you can focus on the aura of one creature within 60 feet of you, that you can see. This focus lasts while you maintain Concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), for up to 1 hour or until you decide to drop your focus. While focusing on a creature's aura, you are aware of its basic emotional state, have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks you make against it, and know its current hit point total. As part of the action to focus on an aura, or later as a bonus action, you can expend 1 or more ki to learn additional information about the target. For each ki you expend, you can learn one of the following:

- If the target is affected by magic, and the school of magic of each effect, if any
- Whether the target is affected by any poisons or diseases
- The resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities of the target, if any
 
_Fist of Planar Power_. You draw on the energy of the Plane of Consciousness to create a blast of force that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 force damage, plus an extra 1d10 force damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don’t move it.
 
**6th level**
 
_Extraplanar Step._ You learn to twist the boundaries between dimensions. As a bonus action, you can teleport up to your monk level squared (floor 10) feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you reach 17th level you can teleport to any location within range you can visualize or describe, even if you cannot see it (however, if you attempt to teleport to a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you take 4d6 force damage, and are not teleported). Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or a long rest, or expend 3 ki to use it again.

**11th level**
 
_Rider Within._ As part of a ritual requiring 10 minutes of mediation, you can search for the aura of another creature, and attempt to perceive using the target's senses. If the target is within 1 mile, you can expend 5 ki to force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC, modified by your knowledge of and connection to the target as noted below. If the target fails the saving throw, you learn the approximate distance to the target (and direction, if the target is within 1000 feet), and can perceive using its senses for up to 10 minutes, while you maintain Concentration. You are blinded and deafened to your surroundings while perceiving this way. On a successful save, the target is not affected, is aware of your attempt, and you cannot use this ability against the same target for 24 hours. A target can choose to fail the saving throw. The target's saving throw is modified as follows:
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Knowledge**|**Save Modifier**|
|Secondhand (you have heard of the target)|+5|
|Firsthand (you have met the target)|+0|
|Familiar (you know the target well, or have previously used Sense Aura ability on this target)|-5|
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Connection**|**Save Modifier**|
|Likeness or picture|-2|
|Possession or garment|-4|
|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like|-10|
 
When you reach 17th level, the range of this ability becomes unlimited, as long as the target is on the same plane of existence as you.
 
Magic that protects the target from scrying also prevents this ability from working on that target.
 
**17th level**
