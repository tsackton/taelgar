**Bonus Proficiency**  
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.
 
**Wrath of the Flame**  
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to scorch your foes. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on this saving throw.
 
You can use this feature a number of time equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
 
**Touch of Fire**  
Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, small, non-magical fire (such as produced by a candle, coals, or a small campfire) does not harm you. In addition, you can use your action to extinguish up to a 5' square of non-magical flames that you can see within 60 feet, or to ignite a flammable object that you can see within 60 feet, as long as the object is not being worn or carried.
 
**Channel Divinity: Divine Inferno**  
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the flames of your Deity. As an action, you present your holy symbol and a fiery inferno bursts forth from you. All creatures you designate within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.
 
**Soul of Flame**  
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, when a creature within 30 feet of you takes fire damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of fire damage.
 
**Divine Strike**  
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
 
**Avatar of Fire**  
At 17th level, your blessed affinity to fire becomes more powerful:

- You gain immunity to fire damage
- When you deal fire damage, you ignore resistance to fire. [but save until 17th level?]
