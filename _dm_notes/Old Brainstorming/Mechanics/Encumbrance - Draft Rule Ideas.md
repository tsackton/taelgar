## Overall goal
 
The main purpose of tracking encumbrance is to make wilderness travel more interesting. There should be challenges you need to overcome to spend a long time hiking far from civilization, and it is not particularly fun if all those challenges are just combats. Needing to keep mounts alive, forage, pick what equipment you can bring, etc, all make for meaningful decisions, both when traveling and on what to spend your money on. Also, making exploration an actual part of the game makes certain characters more viable and increases the use of utility spells that are otherwise pointless.
 
However, tracking weights are annoying, and so there needs to be a compromise between you can carry everything and you need a spreadsheet to play the game.
 
In my opinion, the best way to make that compromise is at the item weight stage. Keep encumbrance rules, but hand-wave the weight of a lot of equipment, especially small, non-expendable items (tools, instruments, arcane focus, kits) and consumable magic items (potions and the like).
 
Also, limiting the amount of gold you can have in general is annoying, but having to be clever about carrying stuff out of a dungeon is good in my opinion. So also hand-wave the weight of "party wealth" by assuming you can convert a lot of your coin into gems, precious metal trade bars, and similar. The weight of gold only matters when you are collecting coins from a dungeon, and even then make it lighter than standard.
 
## How much can you carry?
 
Your Strength score determines how much you can carry at a time:

- You can carry up to 5 times your STR without suffering any consequences of encumbrance
- You can carry between 5 and 10 times you STR and be "lightly encumbered"
- You can carry between 10 and 15 times your STR and be "heavily encumbered"
- You cannot carry more than 15 times your STR
 
## Encumbered condition
 
When you are encumbered, you suffer disadvantages due to the weight you are carrying:
 
##### Lightly Encumbered
 
If you are lightly encumbered, you movement in combat is reduced by 10 feet; if this would reduce your movement to 0, it instead reduces your movement to 5 feet. Out of combat, your normal overland pace is reduced by 1 mile per hour.
 
##### Heavily Encumbered
 
If you are heavily encumbered, you movement in combat is reduced by 20 feet; if this would reduce your movement to 0, you cannot move until you drop some weight. Out of combat, your normal overland pace is reduced by 2 miles per hour. In addition, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
   

## Movement with Encumbrance
 
Unencumbered:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Speed|1 minute|1 hour|1 day (8 hr)|Effects|
|Fast|400 feet|4 miles|30 miles|-5 penalty to passive perception|
|Normal|300 feet|3 miles|24 miles|-|
|Slow|200 feet|2 miles|18 miles|Able to use Stealth|
 
Lightly encumbered:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Speed|1 minute|1 hour|1 day (8 hr)|Effects|
|Fast|250 feet|2.5 miles|20 miles|-5 penalty to passive perception|
|Normal|200 feet|2 miles|16 miles|-|
|Slow|150 feet|1.5 miles|12 miles|Able to use Stealth|
 
Heavily encumbered:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Speed|1 minute|1 hour|1 day (8 hr)|Effects|
|Fast|125 feet|1.25 miles|10 miles|-5 penalty to passive perception|
|Normal|100 feet|1 miles|8 miles|-|
|Slow|75 feet|0.75 miles|6 miles|Able to use Stealth (disadvantage)|
   

(may need to tweak these a little bit to adjust 1 minute movement, but that should not come up much; also penalties may in general be too strict).
 
## Additional Modifiers
 
##### Dropping your backpack

You can allocate as much of your gear as you want to backpacks, pouches, sacks, etc, that can be easily dropped during combat. As a free action on your turn you can drop your gear; these items are not accessible during combat.
 
##### Dwarven racial traits

Dwarves ignore the weight of armor they are wearing when calculating endurance.
 
##### Size

For each size over Medium, double your encumbrance thresholds (this also applies to e.g. Goliaths which have the Powerful Build trait). For each size below small, half your encumbrance thresholds. Small and Medium creatures use the default thresholds.
 
## Adding up Weight
   

**these are notes, this is all taken care of with sheet***
 
There are more or less three categories of stuff:

1. Combat gear (weapons, armor, shield, spellcasting focus, could also include thieves' picks, herbalism kit, and similar; also ammo/potions/other consumable magic items)
2. Travel gear (bedroll, mess kit, rope, out-of-combat kits, rations, torches, etc)
3. Treasure (coins, but also gems, art, trophies, weapons/stuff you want to bring to town to sell, etc)
 
Combat Gear and Travel Gear can both be either fixed or consumable.
 
The point of encumbrance is not to make combat more challenging, but to make exploration require some thought to overcome (e.g., if you don't track encumbrance, what's to stop players from carrying 100 days of food).
 
Also, the point of encumbrance is not to make accumulated wealth a pain, but to make you have to think about what you want to carry back from the dungeon.
 
Implications:

1. Track combat weight and travel weight separately. Assume treasure is part of travel weight. This means encumbrance should rarely be an issue in combat, but you run the risk of losing your gear if things go poorly.
2. Allow a generous conversion of coins to pounds (maybe 100 per pound at least), and allow party wealth to just automagically get converted to high-value gems, etc, so it doesn't weigh anything.  
Bookkeeping is still a problem, as adding up weights is a pain, especially dealing with consumables which change.
 
Possible compromise: since the usual trade off would be you eat food and replace it with treasure as you adventure, basically say that you can allocate a certain amount of weight to consumables, which is fixed even as you use them up. However, in exchange coins \<5000 don't count against encumbrance (after 5000, coins are 100 per pound). In addition, party gold \<5000 also doesn't count, which means in practice the party can carry (N*5000) + 5000 coins, where N=number of PCs. This also means you really can basically ignore the weight of coins, except in unusual circumstances (trying to carry home a dragon's horde, for example).
 
##### Determining weight carried, version 1:
 
Make a list of all items you carry on your person and into combat: add up the weight of all weapons, armor, shield, spellcasting focus, permanent magic items. Ignore the weight of consumables (potions, ammo) if the amount is reasonable. If you want to carry 100 potions into combat or something like that, may need account for them (e.g. could introduce an explicit bundle size, and require more than one bundle to have weight). This is your **Combat Gear Weight.**
 
Make a list of all traveling gear you carry in backpacks, sacks, and containers. A reasonable number of small items (\<= 1 lb) can be ignored. This is your **Traveling Gear Weight.**
 
Make a list of all consumables: food, water, spare ammo, torches, etc. Add 5 lbs for water, 2 lb per day of food you want to carry, and 1 lb per torch/quiver of ammo/etc. This is your **Consumable Weight**.
 
Traveling Weight and Combat Weight will rarely, if ever, change. Consumable weight does change over time as you use items.
 
**Spare Capacity** is what is left, and what you can use to carry treasure, etc.
 
With a well designed equipment sheet, this should be pretty easy to track.
 
**Simplified item counting**

Adding up weights and tracking this is a huge pain, it is better to use a well-designed equipment sheet that does the work for you.
 
The one designed here: [https://idiomdrottning.org/item-sizes/](https://idiomdrottning.org/item-sizes/) has a lot of amazing ideas. However a few modifications are in order:

1. This sheet is far too concerned about tracking *where stuff is*. All I care about is "can you drop it in combat" or not. So basically just need a "backpack" container and a "on your person" container (and then armor)
2. Tiny items (excepting gold) are probably not worth tracking, except in bundles
    1. A bundle of 100 tiny items is a small item, and tiny items \< 100 don't count against weight
        1. To make this work with the slot system: a small pouch holds 100 tiny items, and a medium pouch holds 500 tiny items.
            1. To give free coins, everyone gets one medium pouch that doesn't count against encumbrance
            2. Ammo needs to be more generous and easier to handle; e.q. 20 arrows = 1 lb per RAW, not a medium item -- the medium seems to be accounting for bulk
3. Easier to use smaller slots, so you have 1 slot per unit strength (instead of using stones) -- this means that a medium item is 1 slot, 5 small items fit in a slot, and a big item takes 2 slots. Downside here is that a 20 STR Goliath (double carrying capacity) would be able to carry up to 120 slots. That seems hard to manage? Of course with this system would still be 40 slots…
    1. Certain exceptionally bulky/heavy/awkward items are "heavy" and take X slots but outside of armor (special case) these are pretty rare and can be adjudicated as needed (e.g. trying to carry a solid gold statute from a dungeon would be more than 2 slots). A ladder or a chest also, but again these are odd things to try to carry. I think all the "heavy" weapons are fine as just big items.
    2. Rations should stay around 2 lb per day; practically I would take this to mean either you could bundle 3 rations per slot, or that
