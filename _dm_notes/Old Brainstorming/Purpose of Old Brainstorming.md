While organizing my old notes, I have a lot of material that seems obsolete and is definitely not canon or not used in game, but might have ideas to mine and I'm interested in just preserving the files for posterity. 

For now I'm creating a new folder here, instead of Worldbuilding. 

Homebrew contains old ideas for homebrew material, mostly subclasses and species (races).
