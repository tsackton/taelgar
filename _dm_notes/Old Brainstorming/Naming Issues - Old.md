**Arat/Melikor:**
 
Not necessarily settled on Arat / Melikor names. originally were stolen directly from Tolkein (Eru or Aru / Melkor), other than muscle memory no real reason to stick with similar things. Mike and I at one point came up with 'Am' as the name of the joint divinity of which Aru and Melkor are two halves, so sticking with names starting with 'A" and with "M" has a nice symmetry.
 
**ADDED 1/13/2021: Going with Arha and Malik**
 
**Goliath:**
 
Still don't really like Goliath racial name. Maybe Stoneborn? Then desert variant could be Sandborn. Goliath names themselves are twists on Xhosan (Entamba is a slightly skewed version of mountain in Xhosan), but added a bit more hard vowels, th and k/d endings.
 
**Lizardfolk:**
 
The gods are from Basque names, roughly.
