# City Overview
 
Adderfell is an old city, and was richer and fancier back in the day when it was a center of trade between Sembara and Dunmar in the previous age; was ruined and has been partially resettled now. The region is known for cider and especially apply brandy, and Adderfel is one of the major routes by which they are transported downriver. The area was resettled because it is a natural port (beyond which navigation on the river is not possible) and central to the river valley. 
 
Adderfell a center of trade and commerce where products from the upland river valley (chiefly apple brandy and cider, but also timber and metal) are gathered and shipped downriver by three major competing local merchant houses (and many minor merchant families). It is built on the ruins of an older settlement, which shows in several ways. The old stone walls of the city, while they have been repaired many times, are truly ancient and it shows in the weathering of the stone and the precision of the craftsmanship. Occasionally throughout the town older stone has been reused in newer building, creating an interesting architecture effect. Most notable, however, is the large plaza paved with smooth white marble and featuring a large fountain in the center.
 
Rising above the bustle of the trading sectors of town is the Earl’s manor, perched on a rocky outcropping above the city. While three sides of the outcropping are shear cliffs, isolating the manor from the town below, on the western side (towards the walls) the slope, while steep, is scalable. Leading down from the manor is a switchback road carved into the side of the hill (also ancient), which passes through a series of barracks and meets the defensive fortifications of the main town gate. 
 
Outside the walls and below the manor cliff is a small swampy area of cattails and reeds. A small community of lizardfolk live here, mostly in small wooden huts built over the water. In the northwestern part of town, another settlement has grown up outside the wall, but this is a human community mostly of poorer peasants and folks who are laborers who have moved to town in the past generation or two as its wealth has increased. They live in small shacks along the sometimes swampy and damp lake, and outside the protection of the stone walls. 
 
Adderfell and the region surrounding it is best known for the local apple brandy, which colors a lot of their cuisine and customs. For example, a custom especially espoused by the locals who have lived in town for a while is to serve a glass of an apple cordial, sometimes poured over sharp apple or pear sorbet, both in between courses and as a dessert. The lizardfolk have also adapted apples in their cuisine, and are known for seafood dishes incorporating apples or apple brandy, including a lake fish with apples speciality and freshwater mussels with apple brandy. This “lizard cooking” has a loyal following among some (although not all) the humans in town.
 
These days, things are tense in Adderfell. Crime has increased and there are attacks and thefts at night by unknown assailants. Outside the walls people are barring their doors at night. The lizardfolk communities despite being normally open and welcoming have withdrawn and are closed to visitors, as is the ruling district/manor house. While the military/manor area is pretty safe, and the docks are heavily guarded as are the main warehouses of merchant families. However alleys and streets of the historic district are pretty dicey right now, and Cinder Court is clearly trying to create fear and unrest in the town.

**Additional Notes and Details**  
_Halflings and the Winter Market._ Every year several groups of wandering halfling merchants and travelers come to spend the winter outside Adderfell. They usually arrive in late November, and stay through late February or March, selling trade goods and the like and spending the cooler and rainier parts of winter off the roads, which turn to mud. When the first traveling groups arrive, they set up a Winter Market on the outskirts of the Poor district along the lake, which is typically a big and exciting event, celebrated with feasts and performances (echoing e.g. winter solstice celebrations).
 
_Conflict among the Brandy Houses_. Several warehouses, distilleries, and cellars of merchant houses that produce the apple brandy the area is famous for are located in the northern part of town, inside the walls and adjacent to the old town and the docks. There are three major houses: House Caford, House Aedmor, House Rawley. They are usually in conflict with each other over land and money. Earl Eofric has not focused on the commercial aspects of his rule, happy to just take the money for a license and let them be, so the Houses are somewhat free to build their influence. However, the Cinder Court has been bad for business and at the moment the houses are united in their desire to deal with the problem (but are focused on a local solution). 
 
_The old plaza._ In the center of the old part of town is an ancient plaza, constructed of totally smooth, enormous paving stones with a magical fountain in the center that creates water for itself. This is a relic of the old city before the Blood Years and the Great Plague. It has become something of a central meeting point and heart of the town - many people get water from the fountain, and there is a daily morning market on the plaza, as well as high-status shops lining the streets. To the east towards the water is more run down and the plaza also mark the eastern edge of the fancier part of town. These days the area east of the plaza heading for the river is Cinder Court territory. 
 
_Apples everywhere._ The area has several local customs devoted to unique ways of cooking and drinking apples. In fancy meals, the locals serve a glass of an apple cordial, sometimes poured over sharp apple or pear sorbet, both in between courses and as a dessert. The custom is particularly popular / emphasized in the hustle and bustle of the docks, with small market stands offering a hot meat pie and a glass of a low-grade apple brandy for lunch, for example. The lizardfolk living outside of town have also adapted the local fondness for apples, but tend to prefer seafood, and so have developed a local cuisine around seafood and apples that is has a strong following in the town.
 
_The cliff_. The central feature of Adderfell visible from a distance is a striking cliff rising in the middle of town. The land generally slopes down in rolling hills dotted with orchards towards the lake, but here there is a remanent of harder stone jutting out of the landscape, upon which Earl Eofric’s manor is perched. Historically this was a sacred site, and so the manor house incorporates some ancient distinct stones from a runic circle here. On the east side of the cliff, the slope is slightly more gradual, and an ancient stone road has been carved into the side of the cliff, ascending in switchbacks to the top. This area also have barracks carved into the cliff wall. When the area was first resettled, it was as a military outpost, the military district and ruling district were built first and fortified. Later, the trade, craft, and historic districts grew up around them as the wealth in the area recovered. Finally the poor district sprawled outside the walls.
 
**Other City Locations**
 
_Shops._ Most shops are located in the trade area, up from the docks; or alternatively near the market plaza along the warrens of streets and small alleyways in this area. The exception is weapons and armor; there are a weaponsmith and an armorer in the military district near the bottom of the steep climb, adjacent to the trade area. There are also goods available at market in the old town, and two large food markets (each several times a week), one in the poor area outside the walls and the other in the trade district.
 
_Old Town Market._ Market has a variety of peddlers, tinkers, and merchants. Most simple goods are available, and some additional people. [Simi](Simi.md) the bookseller regularly spends mornings at the market; also [Hanse](Hanse.md) the jeweler, a friend of Simi.
 
_Temples_. There are four temples in town: 

- The biggest, located in at the edge of the historical district, is dedicated to the eightfold gods as a whole, and is built in a the stereotypical octagon with alcoves in each wall. 
- In the Earl’s manor, there is a small temple dedicated to the Wildling
- In the docks district, there is a small shrine dedicated to the Traveler
- In the barracks, there is a small shrine dedicated to the Warlord
- There is also a new temple to the eightfold gods under construction in the craft district
 
_Lizardfolk swamp._ Lizardfolk are not welcoming to strangers at the moment, having closed off their community to outsiders in light of the ongoing dangers of the Cinder Court. If the PCs have a compelling reason to want to come here, can potentially attempt a skill check to be allowed in (can also attempt to sneak in), but would need a convincing reason.
 
_Historical district._ The most obvious feature is the huge plaza and fountain, but there is also an ancient tower that is the home of the Mistress of Letters (Lady someone), who is a reasonably accomplished wizard. She has two apprentice wizards that live with her; otherwise not much magic in town. Between plaza and lake is increasingly Cinder Court territory; main base of operations is out of an abandoned warehouse here.
