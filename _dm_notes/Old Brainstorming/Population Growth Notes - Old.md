Growth rate equals birth rate - death rate, where all are expressed in x per 1000 individuals.
 
Birth rate of 40-50 considered high, although presumably much higher in pre-modern times, maybe 100-200?
      

**Elves**
 
We can get around 2.15 births per woman if we assume that about 10% of elves don't have children, 20% have 1 child, 45% have 2 children, 15% have 3 children, and a small fraction (10%) have much larger families.
 
Assume this is pre-downfall, and post-downfall numbers shift a bit lower, with fewer larger families and a few more with no children.
 
By 1600-1800, the population will be in excess of 500k, and only 0.1% of the population will be the originally created ones (assuming a 50k starting size). Could also get a similar result but with even fewer "originally" created by assuming 5k starting size and the first two generations have 3x fertility.
