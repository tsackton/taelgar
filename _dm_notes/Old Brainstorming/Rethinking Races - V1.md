Sept 2020:
 
Some notes on a bit of a race redesign after a year of playtest experience and with an eye towards increased customization from Tasha's.
 
Logic here is that subraces aren't really subraces in any actual sense. Only Elder races have subraces, and they represent specializations not different lineages. The subrace idea really draws from Tolkien a lot and I don't like the essentializing nature of it.
 
I also think balance concerns are a little overblown. This is for a home game not a min-max party fest and even then, how badly broken can races really be? No one ability should be character-defining, and it will be fine.
 
Finally, ASI customization should be built into the races, as well as possibility of trading ASIs for a feats.
 
So, basic structure: each race has biological traits (darkvision, movement, etc), plus a +1 ASI, plus perhaps some flexible choices (human skill proficiency, dwarven tool/weapon choice, etc). Some things are a bit gray, e.g. keen senses to give elves proficiency in perception, but I think that could be argued to be biology.
 
So you pick a race, then a subrace, then decide whether to take ASIs or a feat. Then you take languages based on race/background, each race has a number of languages they know, mostly based on culture/age.
 
Thinking how this would work for dwarves:
 
Base Dwarf:  
+1 CON, 25 ft speed, not slowed by armor, darkvision 60 ft, common plus 1 language, dwarven training (weapons or tools)
 
Castes then give +1/+1 or a feat, plus runes and some additional training
