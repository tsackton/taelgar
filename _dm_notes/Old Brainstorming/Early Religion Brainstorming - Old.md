Two “real” deities:  Arha and Malik
 
Neither good or evil -- fundamental aspects of the Divinity, which is Unfathomable to mortal minds.
 
Arha is aspect of creation, life, birth  
Malik aspect of destruction, death
 
Together form a duality - both are necessary, there can be no creation without destruction of the old, etc. But many people find Malik uncomfortable to pray to or acknowledge.
 
However mostly worshipping by aspects; descendants of Drankorian empire follow eightfold way, worshipping eight aspects who each are balanced by both Araht and Malik.
 
The eightfold aspects:  
The Mother (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)  
The Father (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)  
The Night Queen (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)  
The Warlord (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)  
The Sibyl (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty)  
The Wanderer (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)  
The Wyrdling (genderless diety of chaos, luck, fate, storms, and weather)  
The Wilding (genderless diety of nature and elements)
 
Eight Virtures (maybe):  
Mother - faith  
Father - justice  
Night Queen - compassion  
Warlord - courage  
Sibyl - love  
Wanderer - charity  
Wyrdling - hope  
Wilding - prudence [??]
 
Eightfold Way based on Drankorian religion tradition. Most people have small shrines in home, larger communities have a shrine or temple. Worship focused on daily devotions at home and feast days/festivals. Also wandering priests/monks, who ask for alms. Major feast days about 1/month, with a few months with extra.
 
(this is Sembara, Chardon, Cymea, etc)
 
Older forms of worship exist too of course:  
-the original inhabitants of the western inner sea followed the old gods (names/pantheon? Or animistic spirits?)
 
Non-human (Firstborn) races typically worship their “god”(s) / Firstborn only, although typically acknowledging Arha (and sometimes Malik) as the creator but seeing them as distant “clockwork gods” 
 
Racial gods typically not worshipped by other races, but not impossible.
 
Demigods/godlings/fey are also common, kind of like saints
   

leaving relationship between "firstborn" and Arha/Malik delibrately vague, dwarves would really think of firstborn just as their gods I think. They would recognize that they are distinct in some way from Arha/Malik but would worship them to intercede with gods, Dwarven clerics would draw their power from the Bahrazel, etc.
 
**Thought 6/19/2020**
 
Divinity comes from belief, which creates power out of the formless Void of Arha / Malik. So minor miracles are common, as power creates worshippers and more belief. Gods want to survive and grow, but ultimately are checked by Arha and Malik, who are the gods and are not the gods. Some beings also exist that are truly separate from Arha and Malik, and exist whether they are believed in or not. Most prominent among these are the firstborn, created from the Void by Arha and Malik. But some others must exist - the “true” dragons, for example, and perhaps some other demigod type creatures. Perhaps Shakun? These are also typically what “evil” gods are, and also the lords of the outer planes - which will need a serious rethink at some point. Need to think about how gods exist - are they just a force in the world, or do they have some real physical presence in outer planes?
