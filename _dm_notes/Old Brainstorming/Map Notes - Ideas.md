Southern archipelago:
 
Volcanic  
Tropical  
Rocky
 
Put equator right at the bottom of the map
 
Chardon valley:  
Big lake in between Voltara and Chardon. Change rivers to flow into lake  
Forest, broken up by civilization  
Trending towards meadow and then sandy beaches towards the coast  
Coast is the jewel of the empire -- resorts and such  
Don't need much in the way of highlands here tbh
 
Sembara: wet, lots of rivers, land sloping down
 
East: desert on high plateau?
 
Weather: comes off ocean to the east
