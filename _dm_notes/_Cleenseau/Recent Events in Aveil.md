The situation in Aveil:

There are three major things going on:
* The three fey (Night Witch, someone in the Madour Hills, the one impersonating [[Marguerite Deschamps]]) are having a competition about who can cause the most mischief, defined in a complex way by Umbraeth, before the 1st day of spring
* The Baroness is hunting the Night Queen, on orders from the lich, and stirring up trouble against the Duke
* The guerilla caves are a bit of a red herring; the Baroness is ultimately trying to push people into the to suck up resources and let her hunt Night Queen/get do-gooders out of the baronry, but it is mostly a nothingburger, although there are a LOT of them to explore and a couple of zombies in each one

Recent events:
* Night Queen temple in Aslain was burned - part of lich attack on Night Queen infrastructure
* Messengers are a big part of the hunting - each of the fey is taking a different approach. The Maudor one is hunting messengers; the Night Witch is corrupting a town and hoping to corrupt a second time; the fey impersonator is causing mischief with orders and in general trying to disrupt baronial operations


What does Jean-Luc know about Aslain:

* Two temples, Mother & Night Queen; Night Queen in old ruined area but (miracle to describe) still worshippers and a small community of dedicants that lives there with a disciple; popular burial place despite being in ruined old town
* Dwarven community, builders and stone masons
* Rich farmland all around; the Lord of Aslain controls an unusual amount of farmland (~15 sq miles) and three villages nestled around Aslain
* Up the Leandre is more sparsely settled

What do people in Aslain know about Veltor state:
* Lots of talk about lack of messages, no help
* Organized an army and marched up to caves; lots of folks still up there but there are lots of caves
	* Exploring this could help get sense that caves are not a good use of time
	* Not baronial
* Some division in the barony around what the baron is doing; not everyone thinks the night queen/duke are the biggest problems; big talk in the town, but mostly people are going with her, especially after the revelations about the Night Queen temple


Town of Veltor - close up around the keep, keep main thing in town. Merriweathers have a small clothing business and there is a law guild and some scribes and stuff, small bit of economy related to upkeep of the barony. Also several bankers. Not a ton of industry though.

Baroness is in the west - what is she doing there? It actually isn't super clear although conceptually I need to know this game. She is a disciple of the lich who has been trying to destroy the night queen resistance. Probably hunting rumors of someone important, but she will claim to be hunting necromancers. Real goal is she has been tasked by the lich to find something in the eaves of the wood - rumors of an old war weapon?

* Umbraeth is now looking to switch to betraying the lich, but carefully carefully carefully in case it doesn't work, so has (recently) asked his various minions to try to drop hints, esp re: baroness
* Squire can talk about feywild general history
* Damien overheard something via a (now used) potion that let him hear
	* He overheard a conversation between Areschera and Duskhound that become Umbraeth. She was describing her two most recent successes - a Tyrwinghan merchant she falsely accused of arson in [[Houille]] that is particularly exciting, he was executed. A young lady in Veltor who was accused of necromancy by her husband. She's been hinting to husband that this was wrong and is close to getting him to kill himself  (she doesn't use names in this)
	* Duskhound 
* Ida will receive a clue (see 1st bullet)
	* A fake messenger bringing a letter from the King to the Army of the West
* Midnight Lady has betrayed Umbraeth and doesn't want to go back, happy in peydon. she killed the duskhound (or banished it) new one is heading there to punish her. she wants the lich to win and hopes the portal gets closed

In Veltor there isn't a lot else going on - Damien escape other people not party 

A couple of possibilities - if Damien has escaped she is going to charge [[Perette]] with helping him escape - or the PCs if she thinks she can make that stick, but she is going to dangle the necromancer hint of the baroness to see if they follow up after feeding them the cursed dust and attempting to charm them.

Her story is going to be that she was questioning him, because she was doubtful of his story and wanted to be sure himself, but obviously his escape means he is clearly guilty. Trying to get Victorine onboard with his, it explains why he wasn't in the jail cell, etc. 

Previous rumors:

There is scattered news from the north of Aveil: that the baroness is hiding in the old guerilla caves in the hills while dozens or perhaps a hundred zombies wander through various villages, or alternatively, that the baroness' fortified seat (Velator) has fallen or perhaps been abandoned. Or that the baroness is raising troops. (Several people are heading north chasing what they feel is pretty firm word that the baroness is raising troops).

> All of these are false actually - an Aslain family was raising troops, not the baron & a number of people (but not the baron) were hiding in the guerilla caves.
