High level structure:
* Early / Mid Jan: Massive confusion and back and forth as units are ordered around aimlessly and confusingly to try to defeat 3 outbreaks: A mummy + skeleton caravan in Enford, zombie horde in the Aine Hills near Ainwick, and an odd oozing undead zombie brain near Dunmore
* Late Jan: All defeated but with much more loss of life; all three colonels are dismissed for mismanagement (general is under lich control) and lack of clarity is introduced to chain of command
* Late Jan: False rumors of huge skeleton army sends south + north watches to Enford; center watch is disbursed over the entire wall
* Late Jan: False rumors of an orc horde gathering in the mountains causes some panic
* Feb 4th: New zombies in Aine Hills only
* Mid Feb: crackdowns on kestavo and hunting zombies with disbursed center watch; south + north still waiting in Enford
* Late Feb: "Army of the Interior" to address the undead; south watch is disbanded and much of the soldiers ordered to report to Embry for the army of the interior muster; most majors/captains/colonels dismissed; north and center watch redistributed to a smaller army of the west
