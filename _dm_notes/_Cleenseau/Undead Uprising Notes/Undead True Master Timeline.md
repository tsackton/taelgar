Cleenseau specifics:
- Two more attacks coming. Jan 12, from Beury. Jan 13, Cleenseau, from south.
- Receive word of council Jan 27
- Wealth tax collectors 


Army of the South is almost entirely destroyed - numerous orders were sent to disperous just before the attack, lots of small companies died trying to break the siege of fellburn. A last desparate attack succeeds Jan 20, but the army is shattered, reduced to 1/3 its normal strength.

This is the last major battle of the zombie uprising, and then the aftermath starts.
