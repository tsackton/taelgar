High level structure:

* Baroness just letting zombies wander in a few key places: boggy east; guerilla caves amongst Veltor; along/from the Enst (baron actually specially attracting to Enst)
* Makes it hard for the barony to function; news moves slowly (partially this is intentionally to collapse communications west of Rinburg)
* Continues until mid-late Feb unless PCs do something
* Rinburg has the lake problem; hard to solve; duke will eventually, unless PCs do something
* Second problem: taxes - the baron will intentionally screw up the wealth tax - take from folks they shouldn't, etc

No army movements or specific details or messages. Minimal comms until early Feb (after 2nd wave), at which point tax + such
