### 2. **The Miracle of the Empty Cauldron**

**Where:** _Beury_  
During a famine, a widow cooked each night in an empty pot, claiming she was “boiling the memory of plenty.” On the seventh night, the pot overflowed with stew. Villagers now eat communal stew from a single vast cauldron on this feast day, stirring it seven times before serving.

### 10. **The Miracle of the Kindly Wind**

**Where:** _Taviose_  
A wildfire from the Cleenseau Wood once threatened the hamlet, until the wind shifted abruptly and drove the flames back. The villagers said it was the laughter of the Wyrdling turning the wind aside. Every year, children climb the hill and shout blessings to the wind.

### 12. **The Miracle of the Ashen Hand**

**Where:** _Beury_  
After a fire destroyed half the village, one girl awoke with gray ash clinging to her hand that could not be washed off. She touched burned beams, and they became firm again. The mark vanished when rebuilding was done. Each year, children smear ash on their palms to bless the village.

### 13. **The Miracle of the Laughing Eel**

**Where:** _Ganboa and Auloutte_  
During the eel season, no catches came — until a young lizardfolk offered laughter to the river instead of bait. That night, eels filled every trap. The festival now includes contests of laughter by the riverbank — whoever laughs last wins a smoked eel.


### **The Miracle of the Empty Cauldron**

In the Year of the Withered Fields, famine struck the village, and a widow named Meret was seen each evening boiling water in an empty pot. When asked why, she said, _“I boil the memory of plenty, that it might feed the hope of tomorrow.”_  
For six nights, the pot stayed empty. On the seventh, it overflowed with rich stew — vegetables, barley, and meat enough for all. None could say where the food came from, but all who ate swore it tasted of warmth and light.

### **The Miracle of the Kindly Wind**

When the great wildfire came down from the forest, it burned with such fury that the people believed their homes doomed. Just as the flames reached the first thatch roofs, the wind turned — a sudden gale roaring from the west, bending trees flat and driving the fire back into the woods.  
By dawn, the flames had died, and the town still stood. No one ever found the cause of the wind, though many swore they heard laughter in its roar.

### **The Miracle of the Ashen Hand**

After a fire destroyed half the village, a young girl named Eliette awoke with gray ash clinging to her right hand that could not be washed away. When she touched the burned beams, they hardened and became firm again, as if renewed.  
For seven days, she worked tirelessly, touching each broken wall and roof until the village was whole once more. When the work was done, the ash mark vanished from her skin.

### **The Miracle of the Laughing Eel**

During a season when no eels were caught in the river, a young lizardfolk woman offered laughter instead of bait. She sat by the water all day, telling jokes and singing nonsense songs. That night, the river shone with silver scales, and every trap brimmed with eels.  
From then on, the people said the river had returned because it had been made to laugh again.
