### Create Goal
Prevent the baronial tax collectors from starting a fight with the lizardfolk.

### Define Central Conflict and Rough Plot
A group of tough and uncouth tax collectors are (illegally) attempting to collect taxes from Ganboa. This is one or two encounters at best. 

The first news of the wealth tax reaches Cleenseau January 29th, and increasing orders from Barony on Feb 4th and 5th.
Gareth and his crew shows up the morning of Feb 6th, in Beury first, then Asineau in the afternoon.

### Define the "roster" and "complications"
Need to define the tax collector group here.
