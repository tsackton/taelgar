The general group around Krauzeth consists of three factions of kobold:

faction A: fiercely loyal to Vraedhul and sees themselves as the guardians of her spawn, will do anything to see him restored and not convinced that she is dead. Leader Tizzit, older matriach, spellcaster. Swore to protect Krauzeth and restore him to his rightful place to Vraedhul as she fled. Has 6 loyal followers.

faction B: "new men" who are loyal to Krauzeth himself, more interested in loot and safety than restoring the glory of Vraedhul. Leader Krizik, one of three warriors who have pledged themselves to Krauzeth. Individually the three strongest warriors, all three believe Krauzeth is destined for greatness and will do whatever he says. 

faction C: the disillusioned, those who would prefer to slink off into the highlands and make their own way, but too scared of Krauzeth to do so. Leader Drubgrak and Vikka, sisters, plus the remaining three kobolds. Drubgrak has wings and believes it is a sign of her wisdom, and will not heed other's advice.

Krauzeth has set himself up with a small lair in an old bear den that he and the kobolds have enlarged, but it is still cramped and uncomfortable. He spends little time there, other than sleeping. 

This lair just below a ridgeline about 2-3 miles from the border stones, on the Addermarch side. Two ridges form a small valley, about 3000' in elevation (the ridgelines are more like 4200' and 4600' or so). Krauzeth has a tendency to prefer to fly along the valley, where he hunts wild deer, bears, and anything else he can find.

To the west is the smallholds of eastern Addermarch, under the control of the Earl of the Highlands, Rhiannon de Vaux (ree-AN-on de VOH). Krauzeth has been raiding here, mostly for food, taking both people and animals. He has destroyed three villages, and raided two others, and the Earl's first attempt to drive him back was a total failure and cost her sixty soldiers. 

The Aben garrison has been fortifying and recruiting, but has not ventured west of Tyrwingha.

General setup. Krauzeth is incautious and to some extent enjoying himself. He has never been out of the Plaguelands and the easy victims are thrilling him. One group of five rangers tried to  lead an attack with two dozen soldiers but were beated back. Some small group of survivors has retreated to the Aben garrison.

Need to make up some of the people in the Aben garrison which is a potentially likely way for the party to approach.

Other alternative is via the Earl of the Highlands

The dragon tends to raid at night, when his kobolds are at their strongest, and during the day the camp is not well secured. Since the failure of the ranger-led raid Krauzeth has felt strong and powerful, and is plotting his next steps.
