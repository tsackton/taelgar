In the aftermath of the Great War, Vraedhul (VRAY-dul), the Burning Shadow, arose from the remains of Cha'mutte, one of the first of his death clutch to awake. Awash in the chaos of Limbo well still in the shell, she was born was a deep affinity for the magic of Limbo. Fleeing east, she settled on the banks of the Nimrathë near a extra-planar weak spot to Limbo.

Over the years, she learned to manipulate this energy, and her lair grew with her thoughts into a series of jagged hills, with a deep crater bubbling with ash and embers in the center. She learned to craft magic items, and delighted in crafting cursed items and sending them out into the world. Sometimes, the ones she cursed would come seeking her help in removing the curse, and she would, sometimes, for a hefty price in gold and gems.

She attracted the worship of kobolds (meta - not clear from were?) and corrupted the very stones and creatures of the land with the magic of Limbo to form unusual servants. At times, she tormented Orenlas, although was never able to pentrate its defenses, and she searched the Plaguelands for treasures to add to her horde. 

In time, she spawned two younger dragons, Zaurmath (ZOWR-math) and Krauzeth (KROW-zeth), and delighted in them. 

Her realm, however, was destroyed by the limbo high tide of 1720, when the extra planar weak spot burst with energy, and her lair was overthrown and she and Zaurmath were killed. What overthrew her lair is unclear: perhaps she is still alive, but trapped in Limbo. Perhaps it was merely the explosion of chaotic energy. Perhaps it was some beast or force from Limbo, hungry to reclaim the magic she had stolen. Either way, her lair is now a jumble of chaos, and much, but not all, of the treasure gone.

Whatever it was, her youngest, Krauzeth, and a dozen kobolds, fled north in a desparate flight, and are now trying to establish a new base in the Tyrwinghan highlands, and grow strong enough to retake and rebuild his mother's lair.
