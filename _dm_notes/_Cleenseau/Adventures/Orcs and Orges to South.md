Level 3

What is really happened? 

For the last few years there have been bands of orcs maurdering in the "triangle" between the Enst, the mountains, and Bandit's Way. These groups usually come out of the mountains and raid for a bit, but are driving back by lack of food, battle loses, or competition from stronger groups. A few times a strong leader has gotten 100-150 orcs together, but they usually are noticed and hunted down.

In July 1719 a particularly and unusually cruel but intelligent ogre made his way down from the mountains (origin a bit mysterious) and started making a bit of a name for himself in the triangle. No word came to Cleenseau, but in Evis a few rumors amongst the caravan guards spread. 

After a few early foray's with mixed results, some deaths but some orc attacks repulsed, things seem to have quieted down. 

In late August and for the past 3 months, however, this ogre has gotten the orcs organized into a group of about 60, split over two warring bands. He has a moveable camp, and has started doing two things:

* Recruiting as many orcs as he can, usually with promise of war and pillage and human flesh for dinner and sport
* Enslaving some of the humans and forcing them to tend to a growing livestock herd of goats, sheep, pigs and horses
* Has been especially interested in getting horse-tenders to give him some calvary and weaponsmiths and so on

Why is he doing this? A dream. He had a dream that if he could build up an army, when the winter rains came, the border town of Cleenseau (the great bridge) would be ripe for plunder.

Story most of the orcs know though is that he's been watching the road -- they've had scouts lurking around.

Next phase is to move his camp, with his enslaved humans, and the livestock closer to town and build up a bit of a base of operations. He has recruiters out as well to try to get a few stragglers or whatever to join up.

He's going to eat most of the humans in a big orgy of destruction before a big push to take Cleenseau.
