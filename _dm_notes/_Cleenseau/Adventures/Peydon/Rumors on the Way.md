The party has an opportunity to pick up rumors along the way. In general, probably won't roleplay this out, unless people want, but instead just narrate.

Here are news and clues they will pick up along the road:
* 
* 
* A **herbalist in a distant town** offers protective charms against _watching eyes._ If pressed, she mutters: “They say in Peydon, **someone watches through the glass.** You’ll want something to keep your secrets close.”   
* A hunter, who used to pass near Peydon, **no longer does after sundown.** “It’s _too quiet._ No owls, no crickets. As if _something’s listening._”.
* **"A lost girl returned—different."** In a nearby village, a child who **vanished for a night** near Peydon was found the next morning. She **refused to say where she went** but now **never looks in mirrors.**

---

*  **"A knight rode into Peydon and never returned."** _(False, but sounds plausible.)_    
    - A drunkard in a tavern claims a **knight went to Peydon, boasting of slaying monsters, but vanished.**
    - In reality, **no such knight existed**—but it could make the PCs believe Peydon _eats heroes._

### **False Clues Planted by the Hag**

3. **"The hag hides in the woods, waiting for travelers."** _(A deliberate misdirection.)_
    
    - A rumor in nearby towns says that **the danger lies in the deep woods near Peydon, not inside the village itself.**
    - The hag **wants outsiders to waste time searching the forest** instead of looking inside the town.
4. **"The old church holds the secret."** _(Planted to send seekers the wrong way.)_
    

- A few months ago, **a ragged traveler came to an inn, muttering about an ancient church near Peydon where the dead first rose.**
- No such church exists—the hag **spread this herself** to lead away anyone investigating her power.

Here are the **refined misleading clues**—they should feel more believable while still subtly directing the players away from the truth.

### **False Clues Planted by the Hag**

5. **"A hag prowls the woods, waiting for travelers."** _(A deliberate misdirection.)_
    
    - In nearby villages, **woodcutters and hunters claim the roads near Peydon aren’t safe after dark.**
    - “They say a hag stalks the trees. Travelers disappear, and if you hear laughter behind you, **don’t turn around.**”
    - **Truth:** The hag deliberately spread this story so that _anyone investigating her will waste time in the forest_ instead of looking in the village. If the players go searching the woods, they might even find **ominous but meaningless signs**—twisted branches, bones, strange laughter—all designed to spook them.
6. **"The old chapel holds the secret."** _(Planted to send seekers the wrong way.)_
    

- A merchant passing through a town swears that **an old, ruined chapel near Peydon is haunted.**
- “That’s where the dead first rose. Something lingers there—**maybe that’s what cursed the village.**”
- **Truth:** There is no such chapel. If the PCs ask around in Peydon, the villagers **might hesitate** when asked about it—some might **pretend they remember it,** while others might **confidently give different locations.**
- The hag **planted this rumor among travelers** to lead people on a wild goose chase. If the PCs find the “chapel,” **they’ll find nothing but old stones and faded ruins unrelated to her.**

### **Refined False Clues with Subtle Red Flags**

7. **"A hag prowls the woods, waiting for travelers."** _(A deliberate misdirection.)_
    - **Initial Clue:** Woodcutters and hunters from nearby villages warn travelers: _“Don’t take the forest road after dark. There’s something out there. People have vanished.”_
    - **Reinforcement:** Some claim to have heard **cackling laughter in the trees, flickering blue lights, or glimpsed a twisted figure watching from the undergrowth.**
    - **Red Flags:**
        - **No one in Peydon has actually heard or seen the hag in the woods**—only outsiders repeat this story. Villagers **seem confused** when asked, like they weren’t aware this was a thing.
        - **The signs in the forest feel too staged.** Twisted branches, eerie symbols, and animal bones look recent and _conveniently arranged_, as if placed for effect rather than real signs of habitation.
        - **No actual disappearances.** If the PCs try to confirm the missing travelers, no one can name them—everyone _heard about someone vanishing,_ but no one knows their name or met them.

**(How players might catch the lie: Players who ask around town will notice the locals don’t corroborate the story, and anyone who checks the “evidence” in the woods might notice how unnatural and arranged it feels.)**

8. **"The old chapel holds the secret."** _(Planted to send seekers the wrong way.)_

- **Initial Clue:** A merchant passing through another town says _“There’s an old chapel near Peydon, right? That’s where the dead first rose. Something cursed that place.”_
- **Reinforcement:** A different traveler _confirms_ that they saw **a ruined chapel in the hills, with strange markings on the stones.**
- **Red Flags:**
    - **No one in Peydon agrees on where the chapel is.** Some villagers say it’s _“near the crossroads,”_ others claim it’s _“half-buried in the hills,”_ and some swear _“there’s no chapel around here.”_
    - **There are no official records of an old chapel.** If the players check with a priest or a temple archive in a nearby town, there’s **no mention of an abandoned holy site**—which is strange, because chapels don’t just vanish from history.
    - **The ruins (if they go searching) are meaningless.** If the PCs visit the supposed site, they’ll find **old foundation stones** that could have belonged to anything. No signs of undead, no curses, just an overgrown heap of rocks.

**(How players might catch the lie: If they ask multiple villagers, they’ll notice no one agrees on the location. If they check historical sources, they’ll find no record of a chapel ever existing.)**

This way, clever players who **ask questions, investigate inconsistencies, or think critically** will be rewarded with the realization that these are false leads.

Would you like any extra depth—maybe ways for the hag to realize they aren’t fooled and react accordingly?
