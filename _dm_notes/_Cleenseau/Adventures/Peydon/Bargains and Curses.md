**Bargain:** A woman asked for her sick child to recover.  
**Cost:** The child recovered but no longer recognizes their mother, treating her like a stranger.

**Bargain:** A guard wanted to be tireless and unyielding in combat.  
**Cost:** He never sleeps, but each night, he loses another memory of his childhood.

**Bargain:** A widow wanted to see her deceased husband one last time.  
**Cost:** She sees him in every reflection, but he is always turned away, whispering something she cannot hear.

**Bargain:** A scholar wanted to understand any language he heard.  
**Cost:** Every night, he forgets his own name and must be reminded of it in the morning.

**Bargain:** A farmer wanted his land to always yield a good harvest.  
**Cost:** His crops grow unnaturally fast, but only he can eat them—anyone else who does falls ill.

**Bargain:** A hunter wished to never miss a shot.  
**Cost:** His arrows always hit, but he cannot control what they strike—sometimes killing livestock, pets, or even villagers.

**Bargain:** A blacksmith wished for his forge to burn hot without needing fuel.  
**Cost:** His shadow is no longer his own—it flickers and moves, sometimes hammering when he is still.

**Bargain:** A farmhand wished to always wake before dawn, full of energy.  
**Cost:** He wakes before dawn, but now he can only sleep when the sun is shining—he grows exhausted but cannot rest at night.

### Costs for Specific Bargains:

1. **Always make a profit on their trades.**  
    **Cost:** No matter what, the merchant profits—but someone else always suffers for it. A neighbor’s harvest is ruined, a friend’s business fails, or a beggar starves as a direct result of each profitable trade.
    
2. **Make evidence of adultery go away.**  
    **Cost:** The evidence is gone, but his wife’s reflection now watches him with cold, knowing eyes. If she ever truly looks into a mirror, she will understand everything at once.
    
3. **Heal a limp.**  
    **Cost:** The limp is gone, but now their footsteps never make a sound—nor do they ever hear their own breath or heartbeat.

### Bargains for Specific People:

4. **The Miller** wished that his grain would always grind swiftly and his flour never spoil.  
    **Cost:** His mill runs even when no one turns the wheel, and in the quiet of the night, he swears he hears voices whispering in the turning stones.
    
5. **The Innkeeper** wished that his inn would always be full of guests.  
    **Cost:** It is always full, but now, no matter how many rooms he rents, there is always an unseen guest—an empty chair at a table, an untouched bed that seems slept in, a shadow moving where no one stands.
    
6. **The Cook in the Manor** wished that her food would always be delicious, no matter what ingredients she used.  
    **Cost:** It is—but every meal she makes tastes like ash to her, and she can no longer enjoy the act of eating.
    
7. **A Maid/Valet in the Manor** wished to always be overlooked and ignored when they wished to be.  
    **Cost:** Now, when they try to speak up or be noticed, people’s eyes slide past them, as if they were not there. Even calling for help in an emergency is a struggle.

### A Bargain for the Cost: "Can never speak the truth."

8. **Bargain:** They wished that no one would ever discover the secret they were hiding.  
    **Cost:** The secret is safe, but now, every time they try to tell the truth about anything, nonsense, riddles, or unrelated words spill from their mouth instead.
