On the second floor of the lord's manor is a guest suite where his lover often stayed. This consists of a grand bedroom, a small office, and a dressing room. Since his lover's death he has refused to come her.

Hidden in the dressing room, next to the wardrobe, is the Dollhouse of Peydon. This is wood, bone, and wicker replica of Peydon, down to the individual house and tree. 

Within this dollhouse are sewn dolls of each person who has made a bargain with Moria. These dolls walk as the real people do.

The dollhouse has several other features:
- it appears as a chest to anyone who has not made a bargain with Moria. This chest feels real to the touch but will not open no matter what. It does detect as magic, although Dispel Magic does not undo the effect.
- the lord's family and descendants can also see it
- anyone who has made a bargain with Moria believes that destroying their doll will cause them to die
- anyone who has a doll cannot leave the village
- destroying the chest would destroy the dollhouse - but the chest is impervious to all damage types except force.  AC 15, HP 15, Damage Threshold 7
- destroying the dollhouse does not undo the bargains but it does mean anyone cursed can leave the village

Finally, and its biggest power, is that Moria can, as a free action on her turn, appear in the dollhouse, touch a doll, and regain all her HP. The bargainer who was touched experiences a sharp pain and momentary disorientation (in combat, this would be stunned for a round).

The hag can also appear in the location of the dollhouse in 2 turns, but she cannot specifically sense anything about it unless it is attacked.
