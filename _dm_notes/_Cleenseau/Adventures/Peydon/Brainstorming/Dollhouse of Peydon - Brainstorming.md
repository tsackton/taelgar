Certainly! Here’s a revised take on **The Dollhouse of Peydon**, emphasizing it as a symbolic manifestation of the hag’s bargains and control, with clues that hint at its existence through uncanny details, subconscious glimpses, and eerie patterns.

---

### **The Dollhouse of Peydon**

**What It Is:**  
A meticulously crafted miniature replica of the village, hidden in the hag’s forest lair. Every villager who made a bargain with the hag has a tiny, sewn-cloth doll in the dollhouse, resembling them in unsettling detail (e.g., a missing button on a coat, a scar, a lock of real hair). The dollhouse doesn’t _directly_ control the villagers, but it symbolizes the hag’s psychic grip on their souls. As long as it exists, she regenerates by drawing power from their trapped will.

---

### **Clues to Discover the Dollhouse**

#### **1. Subconscious Visions (Shared Dreams)**

- **Children’s Nightmares:**
    
    - Kids in the village draw crayon sketches of a “tiny village in the woods” or mention nightmares about “stitched people.” One child’s drawing shows a doll with the magistrate’s distinctive mole.
        
    - A toddler (Adam, the voiceless boy) compulsively stacks blocks into a miniature village and cries when it’s disturbed.
        
- **Adult Sleepwalkers:**
    
    - Bargainers occasionally wake up with mud on their feet, having sleepwalked toward the forest. One villager mutters, “I saw myself… but small. So small.”
        

#### **2. Uncanny Resemblances**

- **Sewn Likenesses:**
    
    - The blacksmith’s wife finds a tiny, crudely sewn doll in her chimney that wears her late daughter’s necklace.
        
    - The magistrate discovers a miniature gavel on his doorstep—an exact replica of his own, but bloodstained.
        
- **Reflections in Water:**
    
    - Staring into the river, PCs might glimpse a distorted reflection of the village as a dollhouse version (DC 14 Perception).
        

#### **3. The Hag’s “Gifts”**

- **Ferryman’s Daughter:**
    
    - The ferryman’s daughter carries a doll with a sewn-shut mouth (she made a bargain to keep her father safe from the hag’s wrath). If questioned, she tearfully admits, “She said I had to be quiet… _forever_.”
        
- **Lord’s Lover’s Diary:**
    
    - A journal in the manor’s attic describes a dream: _“I walked through a house of cloth and straw. My hands were stitched to the walls.”_
        

#### **4. The Hag’s Carelessness**

- **Left Behind “Threads”:**
    
    - PCs find patches of moss-green thread (the same used to sew the dolls) snagged on thorns near the forest’s edge.
        
    - A drunk guard babbles about seeing the hag “mending a tiny roof” during patrol.
        

#### **5. The Bargainers’ Glimpses**

- **Captain Mara’s Flashback:**
    
    - When pressured, the guard captain reluctantly admits: “After I swore loyalty to her, I… I saw _myself_ lying on a table. My cloth body was torn, and she was laughing as she sewed it shut.”
        
- **The Miller’s Confession:**
    
    - The miller (who bargained for a good harvest) whispers: “I woke once with a needle in my hand. There was a scrap of fabric… it looked like _my face_.”
        

---

### **Discovering the Dollhouse**

- **The Ferryman’s Secret:**
    
    - The ferryman knows the hag frequents the “old weaver’s cottage” deep in the woods (abandoned decades ago after its owner vanished). He’ll reveal this if his daughter is threatened or saved.
        
- **Following the Thread:**
    
    - Tracking the moss-green thread leads to the cottage, where the dollhouse sits on a loom-like frame. The walls are papered with villagers’ signed bargains.
        

---

### **Destroying the Dollhouse**

- **Breaking the Bonds:**
    
    - Each doll is sewn with a thread tied to the hag’s regenerative magic. To destroy the dollhouse:
        
        1. **Sever the Threads:** Use silver shears (hidden in the temple) to cut the threads binding the dolls.
            
        2. **Burn the Bargains:** The hag’s contracts (paper scraps in the dollhouse walls) must be burned in the village’s hearth.
            
        3. **Sacrifice a Memory:** A PC must willingly surrender a cherished memory (the hag feeds on such things) to ignite the final blaze.
            
- **Consequences:**
    
    - Villagers freed from bargains collapse briefly, then awaken with no memory of their deals. The hag’s regeneration stops.
        

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Thematic:** The dollhouse reflects the hag’s obsession with ownership and manipulation without overt mind control.
    
- **Mystery:** Clues are tactile and eerie, rewarding observation and interaction with NPCs.
    
- **Player Agency:** Destruction requires creativity and sacrifice, not just combat.
    

Let me know if you’d like to flesh out specific NPC interactions or hag lair details!

### **1. The Lord’s Manor Attic**

**Location:** A dusty, locked attic above the lord’s bedchamber, filled with old furniture and moth-eaten tapestries. The dollhouse sits under a sheet, surrounded by tiny footprints in the dust.

**Clues:**

- **The Lord’s Nightmares:** Lord Peydon wakes screaming about “stitched faces in the walls.” His servants whisper that he refuses to enter the attic since his lover died.
    
- **The Maid’s Mending:** A maid nervously replaces a torn doll-sized curtain in the attic each night (the hag forces her to maintain it). If caught, she begs the PCs not to tell the lord.
    
- **The Lover’s Ghost:** The ghost of the lord’s deceased partner flickers near the attic door, silently mouthing _“break it”_ before vanishing.
    
- **Miniature Details:** The dollhouse’s tiny village square has a bloodstain exactly where Gareth’s execution took place.
    

---

### **2. The Temple Bell Tower**

**Location:** A forgotten alcove in the temple’s bell tower, hidden behind a loose brick. The dollhouse is draped in a burial shroud, with tiny grave markers in its courtyard.

**Clues:**

- **Sister Liora’s Visions:** The temple administrator (cursed to silence) sketches the dollhouse in her prayer book. She urgently points to the bell tower when PCs show interest.
    
- **Mute Child’s Drawings:** Adam (the voiceless boy) leaves crayon drawings of the bell tower with a glowing dollhouse inside. His dog barks at the tower door.
    
- **The Tolling Bell:** At midnight, the bell rings once on its own—the sound comes from the _dollhouse’s_ tiny bell, not the real one.
    
- **Ferryman’s Ledger:** Jarek’s smuggling records note “deliveries of tiny nails and cloth” to the temple.
    

---

### **3. The Abandoned Weaver’s Cottage**

**Location:** A crumbling cottage on the village outskirts, once owned by a reclusive weaver. The dollhouse sits on a loom, threaded with moss-green yarn that pulses faintly.

**Clues:**

- **Children’s Dare:** Village kids dare each other to peek through the cottage’s boarded-up windows. One claims they saw “a little house with dolls that look like Mama.”
    
- **The Blacksmith’s Daughter:** She carries a doll with her father’s hammer—identical to the one in the dollhouse. She found it outside the cottage.
    
- **Hag’s Thread:** PCs find patches of moss-green thread (used to sew the dolls) snagged on thorns along the path to the cottage.
    
- **The Weaver’s Journal:** In the cottage, a journal describes the hag commissioning a “village in miniature” before the weaver vanished.
    

---

### **Why These Work**

- **Quick Destruction:** A single axe swing, firebolt, or good shove destroys the dollhouse. No moral dilemmas or side effects—just a satisfying _crunch_.
    
- **Clues Reward Exploration:** Each location ties to existing NPCs (the lord, Sister Liora, the ferryman) and environmental storytelling (ghosts, children’s antics, odd artifacts).
    
- **Thematic Flavor:** The dollhouse reflects the hag’s arrogance—she hides it _in the village_ because she thinks no one would dare challenge her there.
    

Let me know if you want to flesh out a specific location’s layout or NPC interactions!

I like the weaver's cottage, but the clues are a little obvious. The clues I liked were: "the maids mending", "the lovers ghost", "the tolling bell". Could you modify these to fit the abandoned weaver, or come up with similarly subtle clues?

Thought for 17 seconds

Okay, let's see. The user wants the dollhouse hidden in the abandoned weaver's cottage but with more subtle clues than the previous ones they found too obvious. They mentioned liking the "maid's mending," "lover's ghost," and "tolling bell" clues, so I need to adapt those to fit the weaver's cottage setting.

First, the "maid's mending" clue. Originally, it was about a maid replacing tiny curtains in the attic. To make it subtler and fit the weaver's cottage, maybe the maid is repairing clothes with unusual green thread. The thread could be the same moss-green used in the dollhouse, hinting that she's involved but not directly pointing to the cottage. Players might notice the thread color and later connect it when they find similar thread at the cottage.

Next, the "lover's ghost." The original clue had the ghost near the attic. For the weaver's cottage, the ghost could be seen near the cottage, perhaps trying to communicate. Instead of mouthing "break it," she might drop a scrap of fabric with a partial map or a symbol related to the cottage. This requires the players to investigate the symbol or map piece, leading them to the location without being too direct.

Then, the "tolling bell." The bell tower clue had the dollhouse's bell ringing. For the weaver's cottage, maybe the loom inside the cottage creaks rhythmically at night, mimicking a bell's toll. The villagers could mention strange sounds from the cottage, but not connect it to a bell. The players would need to visit at the right time to hear it, making it a subtler clue.

I should also come up with a new clue involving the ferryman's ledger. Instead of obvious mentions of tiny nails, maybe he has entries about delivering "special thread" to the cottage, which the hag uses for the dolls. The players would need to infer that "special thread" is significant, especially if they find similar thread elsewhere.

Another clue could involve the mute child, Adam. He might play with a doll made of the same moss-green thread, which he found near the cottage. His drawings could show a small house with green threads around it, but not explicitly the dollhouse. This requires connecting his playthings and drawings to the cottage.

The weaver's journal is a good clue but needs to be more subtle. Instead of directly describing the dollhouse, it could mention a mysterious project commissioned by a "Midnight Lady," with sketches of tiny clothes and structures. Players would need to piece together that the project is the dollhouse.

I need to ensure the clues are there but not too on-the-nose. The goal is for players to gather bits of information that, when combined, point them to the weaver's cottage. Each clue should be a piece of the puzzle, requiring some investigation and critical thinking.

Also, the user wants the destruction of the dollhouse to be trivial, so once found, it's easy to destroy. The focus is on the investigation rather than a complex ritual. The clues should lead them there without making the location obvious from the start.

Let me structure each clue with the weaver's cottage in mind, using the elements the user liked but making them fit the new location more subtly. Maybe add a couple more clues involving NPCs and environmental details that hint at the cottage without directly stating it.

Here’s a revised set of **subtle, atmospheric clues** for the dollhouse hidden in the **abandoned weaver’s cottage**, leaning into eerie details and indirect hints rather than overt connections:

---

### **Clues for the Weaver’s Cottage**

#### **1. The Lover’s Thread** (Subtle Replacement for "The Lover’s Ghost")

- **Fabric Scraps in the Manor:**
    
    - The ghost of Lord Peydon’s deceased partner appears briefly in the manor, silently unraveling a scrap of _moss-green thread_ from her sleeve. If followed, she leads PCs to a hidden sewing kit in the lord’s study containing a half-finished doll’s dress made of the same thread.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The thread matches the cottage’s overgrown, ivy-choked loom (which PCs might only notice later).
        

#### **2. The Tolling Loom** (Replacement for "The Tolling Bell")

- **Rhythmic Night Sounds:**
    
    - Villagers complain of a “_knocking_” or “_steady clacking_” coming from the abandoned cottage at night. Investigation reveals it’s the sound of the cottage’s old loom rattling on its own—its treadle moving as if weaving invisible thread.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The loom’s rhythm matches the tolling of the temple bell (a hidden clue that the hag’s magic warps time/space).
        

#### **3. The Maid’s Mending** (Adapted for the Cottage)

- **Stolen Supplies:**
    
    - The manor’s maid nervously replaces a spool of moss-green thread in the kitchen each morning. If confronted, she claims the hag “_takes it for repairs_” and forces her to leave it by the cottage door at dusk.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The thread is identical to the frayed edges of villagers’ clothing (those who made bargains).
        

---

### **Additional Subtle Clues**

#### **4. The Ferryman’s “Special Deliveries”**

- **Ledger Entry:**
    
    - The ferryman’s records mention “_one bolt of twilight cloth, delivered to the weaver’s cottage_” (dated after the weaver’s disappearance). If pressed, he mutters, “_She wanted it for her… art._”
        
    - **Subtlety:** “Twilight cloth” is a local term for fabric dyed with nightshade berries—the same poison used in the hag’s bargains.
        

#### **5. Adam’s Silent Game**

- **The Mute Child’s Doll:**
    
    - Adam (the voiceless boy) carries a crude doll made of sticks and _moss-green yarn_. When asked where he got it, he points toward the woods and mimics sewing.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The doll’s yarn is frayed from the cottage’s loom.
        

#### **6. The Weaver’s Last Project**

- **Journal Fragment:**
    
    - In the cottage, PCs find a water-damaged journal entry:  
        _“The Midnight Lady commissions a village in miniature. She says it will ‘hold their hearts.’ I fear I’ve threaded more than cloth…”_
        
    - **Subtlety:** The word “hearts” is crossed out and replaced with “_souls_” in faded ink.
        

#### **7. The Hungry Shadows**

- **Loom’s Reflection:**
    
    - At dusk, the cottage’s grimy windows reflect a distorted version of the village—the dollhouse’s silhouette. A PC who investigates sees tiny shadows moving inside.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The vision vanishes if a villager who made a bargain approaches.
        

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Atmosphere Over Exposition:** Clues rely on environmental storytelling (sounds, textures, reflections) rather than NPCs directly explaining things.
    
- **Connective Threads:** The _moss-green yarn_ ties multiple clues together (the maid, Adam, the loom) without being heavy-handed.
    
- **Discovery Feels Earned:** PCs piece together the cottage’s significance through subtle repetition of details (thread, sounds, reflections).
    

The hag’s arrogance is her downfall—she hides the dollhouse _in plain sight_, assuming the villagers are too broken or afraid to notice.

I like this all quite a bit except I'm not sure about the moss-green yarn or twilight cloth. Also I'm not sure how a weaver would weave a dollhouse? unless it is a tapestry? Can you tie those together and get rid of the idea that there is special yarn?

Thought for 11 seconds

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants the dollhouse in the weaver's cottage but without the special moss-green yarn or twilight cloth. They also want to clarify how a weaver would create a dollhouse.

First, the moss-green yarn was a key element in previous clues, so removing it means finding alternative clues. The user prefers subtlety and realism. The weaver's craft needs to connect logically to the dollhouse. Maybe the dollhouse is made of woven materials instead of fabric, like wicker or straw. That makes sense for a weaver, as they might work with reeds or other natural fibers.

Next, the clues. The user liked the maid's mending, the lover's ghost, and the tolling bell. I need to adapt these to fit the weaver's cottage without special yarn. The lover's ghost could leave straw or reed fragments instead of thread. The maid's mending could involve repairing tiny woven items found around the manor. The tolling bell clue can be replaced with the sound of a loom creaking rhythmically at night, tying into the weaver's craft.

For the dollhouse construction, using wicker or woven reeds explains the weaver's involvement. The structure is a miniature village made of natural materials, each house woven meticulously. This connects the weaver's skills to the dollhouse without needing special cloth.

Clues need to be subtle. Maybe villagers have strange interactions with straw or reeds, like finding tiny woven objects. The ferryman's ledger could mention deliveries of reeds to the cottage. The mute child might play with a small woven doll, pointing towards the cottage. The ghost's fragments lead to discovering materials used in the dollhouse.

Avoiding special yarn, the focus shifts to natural materials and the weaver's existing trade. This keeps the clues grounded and the dollhouse's creation plausible. The destruction remains simple—smashing the delicate woven structure is easy once found.

Need to ensure all clues tie back to the weaver's cottage without relying on unique items. Emphasize environmental storytelling and small, eerie details that hint at the dollhouse's location and purpose. The hag's control is symbolized through the woven replica, and destroying it breaks her regenerative link without affecting the villagers' bargains.

Got it! Let’s reframe the dollhouse as a **woven wicker structure** (like a basketmaker’s craft) instead of fabric, and eliminate special materials like moss-green yarn or twilight cloth. The weaver’s cottage becomes a place where reeds, straw, and willow branches are woven into uncanny miniatures. Here’s the revised concept:

---

### **The Dollhouse of Peydon**

**What It Is:**  
A delicate, life-sized replica of Peydon village, woven entirely from reeds, willow branches, and straw. It sits in the abandoned weaver’s cottage, hidden under a tarp. Each villager who made a bargain has a tiny wicker figurine in the dollhouse, eerily accurate (e.g., the blacksmith’s braided beard, the ferryman’s patched coat). The hag regenerates by channeling the villagers’ trapped willpower through the dollhouse.

**How the Weaver Ties In:**  
The weaver was a skilled basketmaker who specialized in crafting intricate wicker decorations for festivals. The hag corrupted their craft, forcing them to weave the dollhouse before disposing of them.

---

### **Subtle Clues to the Weaver’s Cottage**

#### **1. The Lover’s Fragments** (Ghostly Clue)

- **Straw in the Manor:**  
    The ghost of Lord Peydon’s deceased partner scatters _braided straw fragments_ in the manor’s halls—identical to the dollhouse’s wicker walls. If followed, she leads PCs to a hidden basket in the lord’s study containing a tiny wicker doll of herself.
    
- **Subtlety:** The straw matches the reeds growing near the cottage’s collapsed roof.
    

#### **2. The Tolling Loom** (Sound-Based Clue)

- **Creaking at Dusk:**  
    Villagers hear a rhythmic _creaking_ from the cottage at twilight, like a rocking chair or an old loom. Investigation reveals it’s the sound of wind whistling through the dollhouse’s wicker structures, mimicking the village’s daily rhythms (e.g., the creak of the ferry rope, the blacksmith’s hammer).
    
- **Subtlety:** The creaks sync with real sounds in the village (e.g., dollhouse ferry creaks when the real ferry moves).
    

#### **3. The Maid’s Repairs** (Adapted for Wicker)

- **Tiny Wicker Debris:**  
    The manor’s maid nervously sweeps up _shredded reeds and willow bark_ each morning. If questioned, she admits the hag forces her to “_repair the old cottage decorations_” but refuses to elaborate.
    
- **Subtlety:** The debris includes a half-finished wicker doll of the lord, hidden in her apron pocket.
    

---

### **Additional Clues (No Special Materials)**

#### **4. Children’s “Toy” Village**

- **Stick Replicas:**  
    Village kids build tiny stick models of Peydon’s buildings near the river. One insists, “_The witch’s house is made of straw!_” They found inspiration in the cottage’s collapsed wicker fence.
    
- **Subtlety:** Their models include a miniature cottage with a caved-in roof—just like the real weaver’s home.
    

#### **5. The Ferryman’s Guilt**

- **Reed Deliveries:**  
    The ferryman’s ledger lists “_bundles of river reeds_” delivered to the weaver’s cottage weekly. He claims the weaver “_paid extra for silence_” before vanishing.
    
- **Subtlety:** Reeds in the cottage match those used in the dollhouse’s construction.
    

#### **6. Adam’s Silent Play**

- **The Mute Child’s Game:**  
    Adam (the voiceless boy) arranges braided straw into tiny figures. When disrupted, he throws a tantrum and points furiously toward the woods.
    
- **Subtlety:** His straw figures resemble villagers known to have bargained with the hag.
    

#### **7. The Hag’s Mockery**

- **Bird’s Nest Clue:**  
    A magpie nest in the village square contains a stolen wicker doll of the hag herself. The doll’s face is twisted into a sneer, and its hands clutch a tiny parchment: _“Mine.”_
    
- **Subtlety:** The nest is lined with straw from the cottage’s collapsed roof.
    

---

### **Why This Works**

- **No Special Yarn/Cloth:** The dollhouse is woven from ordinary reeds and straw, tying it to the weaver’s existing trade.
    
- **Subtle Environmental Storytelling:** Clues rely on textures (straw, wicker), sounds (creaking), and mundane materials (river reeds).
    
- **Plausible Construction:** A skilled basketmaker could realistically craft a wicker dollhouse.
    

---

### **Destroying the Dollhouse**

- **Simple Destruction:** The wicker structure is fragile. A torch, axe, or even a strong kick collapses it. As it burns/crumbles, the hag’s screams echo from the village.
    
- **No Reversal of Bargains:** Villagers remain bound to their deals, but the hag loses her regeneration.
    

This keeps the dollhouse narratively impactful but mechanically simple, as requested! Let me know if you’d like to tweak fur


### **5. Concealed by Neglect**

**Why It’s Hidden:**  
The dollhouse is buried under collapsed roof beams, moldy straw, and old tools. Only its highest “tower” peeks out, resembling the cottage’s own broken chimney.  
**Clues to Spot It:**

- **Mismatched Materials:** The “chimney” is made of fresh, unstained reeds (the hag’s repairs) amid rotten debris.
    
- **Animal Behavior:** A crow perches on the exposed tower, trying to steal a shiny button from a wicker figurine.
    
- **The Hag’s Carelessness:** A tiny wicker ghoul (matching the undead that attacked Peydon) lies half-crushed under a beam.
    

---

### **6. A Living Illusion**

**Why It’s Hidden:**  
The hag’s magic makes the dollhouse appear as a harmless pile of kindling or a rusty loom—until a villager who made a bargain touches it, breaking the illusion.  
**Clues to Spot It:**

- **Selective Visibility:** The mute child (Adam) stares terrified at “nothing” (the disguised dollhouse).
    
- **Bargainer’s Touch:** If a PC forces a villager (e.g., the ferryman) to enter the cottage, they recoil, crying, “I won’t go near that _thing_ again!”
    
- **Shadow Play:** At noon, sunlight through holes in the roof casts a shadow of the dollhouse’s true form on the floor.
    

---

### **Why These Work**

- **Environmental Storytelling:** The hiding methods tie to the weaver’s craft, the hag’s arrogance, and the village’s decay.
    
- **Rewards Curiosity:** Players who poke through debris, study patterns, or interrogate NPCs will piece it together.
    
- **Thematic Consistency:** The hag’s control is literally “woven” into Peydon’s bones—hidden but fragile.
    

The dollhouse’s fragility (easily crushed/burned) contrasts with the hag’s seeming invincibility, making its discovery a satisfying “aha!” moment.

---

### **The Living Illusion: Hag’s Arrogant Deception**

**Why It’s Hidden:**  
The hag cloaks the wicker dollhouse in a persistent illusion, making it appear as a mundane or unremarkable object in the weaver’s cottage—like a **rusty loom**, a **pile of firewood**, or a **collapsed shelf**. The illusion is _selectively visible_:

- **To Outsiders:** It looks ordinary.
    
- **To Bargainers:** They see a distorted, terrifying version (e.g., the loom “bleeds” moss-green sap, the firewood “whispers”).
    
- **To the Hag:** She sees the dollhouse plainly, arrogantly assuming no one else can pierce her magic.
    

---

### **Clues to Pierce the Illusion**

#### **1. The Mute Child’s Terror**

- **Adam’s Reaction:**
    
    - Adam (the voiceless boy) refuses to enter the cottage, clawing at his throat and shaking violently if forced near. If the PCs use _Detect Magic_ or _See Invisibility_, they notice his eyes reflect the dollhouse’s true form.
        
    - **Subtlety:** His crayon drawings show the cottage with a wicker monster inside, labeled _“HER HOUSE.”_
        

#### **2. The Ferryman’s “Gift”**

- **Distorted Reflection:**
    
    - The ferryman (Jarek) carries a shard of mirrored glass (a hag “reward”). If held up in the cottage, the mirror shows the dollhouse’s true form for 1 round before cracking.
        
    - **Subtlety:** The mirror shard is hidden in his ferry shack, wrapped in a cloth marked _“FOR THE LADY’S EYES ONLY.”_
        

#### **3. The Tolling Illusion**

- **Sound Without Source:**
    
    - The illusion emits faint sounds tied to the real village: creaking ferry ropes, tavern laughter, or the blacksmith’s hammer. These sounds have no visible source in the cottage.
        
    - **Subtlety:** A PC who succeeds on a DC 14 Perception check notices the sounds sync perfectly with events in the village (e.g., dollhouse tavern laughter erupts when the real tavern cheers).
        

#### **4. The Lover’s Silent Cry**

- **Ghostly Interaction:**
    
    - The ghost of Lord Peydon’s partner appears in the cottage, desperately miming the act of _ripping a veil_ from her eyes. If the PCs mimic her动作, the illusion flickers for 1 round, revealing the dollhouse.
        
    - **Subtlety:** Her ghostly hands leave faint frost patterns on the illusion’s surface.
        

#### **5. Bargainers’ Blind Spot**

- **Selective Ignorance:**
    
    - Villagers who made deals with the hag avoid looking directly at the illusion. The maid nervously sweeps around it, the blacksmith “trips” near it, and the ferryman claims, _“Nothing to see here, just junk.”_
        
    - **Subtlety:** A successful DC 12 Insight check reveals their avoidance is _too deliberate_.
        

---

### **Breaking the Illusion**

The dollhouse becomes visible if:

1. **A Bargainer Touches It:** Any villager who made a pact interacts with the illusion (e.g., the maid “accidentally” bumps it while cleaning).
    
2. **Magic Dispelled:** A _Dispel Magic_ or _Remove Curse_ cast on the illusion destroys it.
    
3. **Hag’s Mockery:** The hag herself dismisses the illusion if provoked, snarling, _“You want to see my masterpiece? THEN SEE IT!”_
    

---

### **Destroying the Dollhouse**

Once visible, the wicker structure is laughably fragile:

- **Melee Attack:** One hit (AC 10, HP 1) reduces it to splinters.
    
- **Fire:** A torch or _Fire Bolt_ ignites it instantly.
    
- **Thematic Flair:** A PC can dramatically unravel it by pulling a single “keystone” thread (DC 10 Sleight of Hand).
    

**Effect:** The hag’s regeneration stops, and she shrieks, _“NO! YOU WRETCHED MAGGOTS!”_ as the dollhouse crumbles.

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Eerie Mystery:** The illusion feeds into the hag’s manipulative, theatrical nature.
    
- **Player Triumph:** Piercing the illusion feels like outsmarting the hag’s arrogance.
    
- **Speed:** Destruction is quick, keeping focus on the final hag battle.
    

The hag’s downfall is her pride—she never considered that mere adventurers (or “maggots”) might unravel her art.
