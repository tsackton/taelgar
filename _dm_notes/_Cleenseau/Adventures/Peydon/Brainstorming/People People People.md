### Lord's Household

- **Ysabeau du Vinge (Steward)** – The true day-to-day ruler of the town, she manages the lord’s affairs. She is stern, intelligent, and devoted to protecting Peydon, but knows she walks a tightrope. She might reveal crucial hints about the hag’s hidden power if persuaded.
- **Sergeant Renier Vasson (Head of the Guard)** – Loyal to Lord Arnault, but frustrated with the unnatural hush that has settled over the town. He may be an ally if convinced the hag’s grip can be broken.
- 
- **Ysabeau Daverre** – The lord’s daughter, who was once a bright and lively presence in the town but has grown withdrawn. She lost her mother to illness years ago, and now whispers say the hag has taken a strange interest in her. Some claim she has begun speaking to shadows.
-

-  **Jehan de Vercy (The Lord’s Steward)** – A gaunt, meticulous man who insists nothing unusual happens in the manor—but his hesitation betrays him. _(Hint: "The lord never enters the western attic anymore. Used to go up there often before his husband died.")_
- **Ysabeau du Vinge (The Cook)** – A stout woman with a sharp tongue, protective of the lord but terrified of the unseen. _(Hint: "There’s a door in the cellar that doesn’t lead anywhere. We bricked it up after the attacks, but no one remembers why.")_
- **Gautier le Fèvre (The Stablemaster)** – Elderly but strong, he was the lord’s husband’s childhood friend. _(Hint: "The lord and his husband once had a place they called ‘their secret room.’ I don’t think he remembers it exists.")_
- **Huguette la Garde (The Chambermaid)** – A quiet girl with burn scars up one arm, as if from a candle that never went out. _(Hint: "I saw the lord speaking to someone in the mirror once. But he was alone.")_




5. **Sister Odile Martenne** – The temple administrator, a severe and practical woman who cares for the village’s spiritual well-being. She does not trust the hag but cannot openly defy her. She secretly keeps records of all the hag’s "blessings" and their consequences, hoping to one day find a way to break the town’s curse.

    
6. **Brother Almeric** – The town’s aging priest, a man of quiet faith who _knows_ something is wrong but has learned not to speak of it. He once tried to call for help but found himself unable to leave the village, his horse always going lame or his letters mysteriously vanishing.
    

    
8. **Ysabel du Vigne** – A talented weaver with a small shop, cursed with prophetic dreams she cannot remember upon waking. She wakes up screaming most nights and suspects the hag is to blame but has no proof. If she could be made to remember, she might provide a vital clue.

3. **Renaud the Smith** – His forge never cools, yet his house is always cold. _(Hint: "I swore I heard a tiny hammer striking metal in the manor walls at night.")_
    
4. **Denis the Miller** – His left eye is always shut, though there’s nothing wrong with it. _(Hint: "I dreamed I was a little doll last night. When I woke up, my eye wouldn't open.")_
    
5. **Isabeau the Weaver** – She can thread a needle in the dark but sometimes forgets her own name. _(Hint: "The first time she called on my bargain, I lost a whole day. Just _gone._")_

### **⟡ Those Afraid of the Hag (8) ⟡**

(_Terrified of what lurks in Peydon, these villagers are reluctant to speak—unless reassured._)

6. **Brother Almeric (The Temple Administrator)** – A thin, balding man who won’t meet your eyes. _(Hint: "She is not in my temple. But I know she is listening.")_
    
7. **Thibaut the Baker** – Keeps his oven going at all hours, fearing what lurks in the dark. _(Hint: "The whispers stop when the flames are high.")_
    

8. **Martin the Tinker** – Carries a mirror shard wrapped in cloth, refuses to say why. _(Hint: "I broke my looking glass and for a day, she was _gone._")_
    
9. **Perrin the Innkeeper** – The only one who still locks his doors at night. _(Hint: "She _likes_ visitors. That’s why she wanted us open again.")_
    
10. **Odile the Widow** – Always carries a candle, even in daylight. _(Hint: "I saw a woman vanish in the reflection of my soup.")_
    
11. **Henri the Fisherman** – His nets keep coming back empty, and he’s too afraid to fish at night. _(Hint: "The river’s too still when she’s watching.")_

This list gives a good mix of manor staff, dealmakers, fearful villagers, and potential informants. The PCs will have to carefully piece together their information before the hag catches on. Do you need additional connections between them, or is this a solid starting point?

This is a solid starting point. I might ask for more details about some of these. Can you give me a name of the lord as well and his husband?

###### ChatGPT said:

Glad you like it! Here are names for the lord and his late husband:

- **Lord Amaury de Merval** – The weary, prematurely aged lord of Peydon, who believes he sacrificed his youth to save the village. Once known for his sharp wit and charisma, he now moves like a man carrying an invisible burden.
    
- **Ser Matthieu de Merval** – His late husband, a former knight who died in the undead attack two months ago. He was beloved in Peydon for his kindness and dedication, often seen aiding the town’s defenses and tending to the wounded. His death drove Amaury to desperation—and to the hag.
    

Let me know if you’d like more details on either of them!

### **Notable Villagers**

2. **Jeanne Ravois** – The ferryman’s widow. She was once complicit in Gareth’s schemes but turned against him when he pushed too far. She now works the ferry herself and knows more than most about who comes and goes from Peydon. The hag seems to tolerate her, but Jeanne is terrified of being caught in her web.
    

    
4. **Tilde Bresson** – The innkeeper, a stout woman who keeps her head down and pretends everything is fine. She refuses to acknowledge the hag’s influence, even when evidence is right in front of her. She maintains a facade of normalcy, but fear lurks beneath her cheerful demeanor.
    
5. **Gaspard "Old Gaspard" Moreau** – The town’s eldest resident, a former soldier who claims he remembers a time before the hag’s influence. His mind drifts between lucidity and confusion, but he sometimes speaks unsettling truths—often dismissed as the ramblings of an old man. He carves wooden charms, claiming they ward off "her" gaze.

Bargiains and problems
6. **A Mind Fractured by Fear** – Someone saw something they weren’t meant to—perhaps the hag’s true form or the undead rising before the deal was made. Their mind is intact, but they experience periodic dissociation or hallucinations, making it hard for them to express themselves clearly.
    
7. **A Curse of Unspoken Truth** – The hag cursed them so that every time they try to speak the truth, it comes out as nonsense, riddles, or unrelated words. They can still talk, but no one understands them unless they find a way to work around it (e.g., writing, charades, or encoded messages).
    
8. **A Locked Mind** – They can still understand language but have lost the ability to form words or write. Maybe they communicate in gestures or symbols, or their attempts at writing turn into strange glyphs only decipherable by magic.
    
9. **Speech Stolen, but Not Words** – They can speak, but only in quotes from other people, books, or overheard conversations. Their speech is a patchwork of borrowed phrases, making it hard to follow their meaning.
    
10. **A Puppet for Another** – Their words are not their own. Some outside force (the hag? A lingering undead presence? The remains of a stolen soul?) speaks through them at unpredictable moments, forcing them to stay silent or risk revealing something dangerous.

11. **Captain Mara (Guard Captain)**
    
    - **Bargain:** Promised loyalty for power; now her shadow acts independently (a **shadow** enemy if provoked).
        
    - **Clue:** Drunk in the tavern, she mutters about “eyes in the water.”
