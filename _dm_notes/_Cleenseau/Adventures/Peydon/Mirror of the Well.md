The other way Moria keeps control of the town is the Mirror in the Well. This is a magic mirror hidden in a bricked up well which allows Moriel to look through any reflective surface - a pool of water, a mirror, a pane of glass, a shiny piece of metal, etc. 

She can do this at will, and is additionally notified whenever:
- someone says any of her names of titles
- someone asks about a hag, bargain, curse
- a stranger in town talks to a townsperson for more than 5 minutes

The mirror can only be broken by either
- Moriel renouncing it
- Moriel being blinded
- Moriel being killed
- Random high level magic

However, if the mirror itself is covered/blocked it doesn't work.
