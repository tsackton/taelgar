 ### Create Goal
Free Peydon from the Midnight Lady's influence.
### Define Central Conflict and Rough Plot
Ultimately, removing the Midnight Lady from Peydon will require either:
* Giving her something she wants more than a place to practice mischief
* Killing her
* Creating a spirit of resistance in the town such that everyone agrees to say no to the hag
#### Outcomes
* Kill the hag
* Agree to leave the hag in place, perhaps with some deal on what she can do
* Force the hag out without killing her
* Retreat / allow her to stay
### Define the "scenes"

#### Scene 1:  Rumors Before
* In Houille people are quite mad about losing the baronial charter for the weekly market to Peydon, across the river. [[Marguerite Deschamps]] sent an order in mid-to-late January.

* At a riverside market, a trader says a ferryman in Peydon refuses to take money from some passengers, waving them on with a troubled look. No one knows why—he just seems to know who they are.
#### Scene 2: The Ferry
Crossing over the Auberonne. 

There are three people crossing along with the party: a couple of hunters from Aslain heading for the woods to hunt deer, and a young woman (Mara) traveling from the Fellburn area heading to distant family north of Peydon.

Edouard, the ferryman, is very solicitous of Mara, and refuses to charge her for passage. (He is also very unwiling to carry Graymalkin and charges 100 crows = 80 gp). When dropping Mara off, the ferryman strongly pushes her to go rest at the inn before taking the next stage of her journey, telling whatever tales he thinks will convince her to do so.
#### Scene 3: The Inn
Innkeeper is Gautier Leclair (He/Him) - Go-tee-ay Luh-klair

The inn is basically empty, as it isn't a market day. 

He is resigned to his fate; he has not made any bargains with the hag but knows there is something bad happening, but he does his best to pretend like there isn't. He refuses to acknowledge the hag’s influence, even when evidence is right in front of him. He maintains a facade of normalcy, but fear lurks beneath her cheerful demeanor. He cares deeply about his wife and three teenaged sons, and the one thing that might motivate him is some type of safety for them. 

There are also two serving girls at the inn, Violet and Abigail.  Violet and the innkeeper were both working for Gareth under duress, as the hag told him about their affair. Since he has left, they have broken things off, but Violet was pregnant and the hag aborted the baby. Need to think about this a little bit. Violet will talk about whatever is asked, if they have a rapport with her, but not if the hag is watching.
#### Scene 4: The Village
This will involve talking to people, finding clues about the dollhouse and mirror, and destroying one or both of them.

Some specific people:

**Ysanne the Shepherdess** – Her flock won’t cross near the bricked-up well. 
**Léon Brivain**. An older man, well lettered, scribed for those who couldn't read and write. Did not actually make a bargain with the hag, but (tried) to write several letters begging for help/warning people away/etc. The hag cursed him so that anything that he said or wrote as truthful would come out garbled and backwards.
**Jehannot the Carter** – His hands shake when he tries to hold silver. 
**Guillaume the Woodcutter** – A hulking man with scars from a fight he refuses to describe. 
**Héloïse the Alewife** – Laughs too much, but always looks over her shoulder. 
**Marc and Eloi Delacroix** – Brothers who run the mill. Marc is sullen and untrusting, while Eloi is charismatic and well-liked. 
**Angie Ravois** - Baker
**Almeric (Temple Administrator)** – 

Noteable places in town:
* Mother's Temple
* Mother's Grove
* Main Square
* North Square
* Woodlot
* Brewery/Tavern
* Bricked up well

#### Scene 5: The Manor House
**Magistrate Hubert Caillaux** – The town’s lawkeeper, appointed by Lord Émeric. A pragmatic man who enforces the laws selectively—he knows the hag is in charge but pretends otherwise, maintaining a fragile peace. He despises Gareth and is relieved he’s gone, but he fears what the hag might do next

**Lord Émeric Daverre** – The weary and aging lord of Peydon. After the undead attack, he made a desperate bargain with the hag, and it has taken a toll on him—his hair turned white overnight, and he often seems lost in thought. He remains lord in name, but his authority is waning as he avoids conflict and focuses on keeping the town stable. He is protective of his daughter, **Ysabeau**, and quietly fears she is next in the hag’s schemes.

**Lady Estelle Daverre**. Emeric's wife. 
**Lady Odile Daverre** Estelle's wife. 
**Arnault Daverre**, Emeric's husband. Dead. 

**Roland Vaissier** – The captain of the household guard. He was once a proud and disciplined knight, but after the undead rose, he became a broken man. He remains fiercely loyal to the lord but drowns his shame in drink, leaving his guards undisciplined. The hag taunts him in whispers only he hears. 

"I gave her my youth. She took it, and in return, she promised to protect the town from the undead, save my family, and give us peace. She bound my bloodline to the land, ensured it would remain strong and free of harm, and in return, I gave up my youth for the safety of those I love."

Servants and household staff. The lord's family has become withdrawn and hosts little and the household has shrunk.
Three servants: Cook, lady's maid, valet
Older son is traveling with Duke, feared dead in Fellburn or other battles, not clear of fate. He has a wife and child in Wisford
Older daughter killed along with her husband and two young children in the Ashecombe hills in the early fall by a wild bear.
#### Scene 6: The Widow’s Aalis House
This is the hags lair, and the chance for a final encounter. There is one trick - the root cellar is not actually accessible from the house. It can only be accessed from the back door, by opening it three times. On the third time, it opens to the root cellar. 

### Define the "roster" and "complications"
There are no real enemies to fight other than the hag herself; she may send some of her conjurations after the players in some circumstances, and there might be one or two minor undead or fey enemies that pop up.

The major complication is the "dollhouse" version of Peydon. Until it is destroyed the hag can, as a free action, step into the dollhouse, and drain health from a villager and then return to her location. (This is perceptible as a flicker). This resets her to full health at the cost of causing something to happen to the villager (need to decide what but it shouldn't be death or permanent damage).

A secondary complication is the Mirror of Whispers, hidden in an old well.
