### The Gang

**Mireille "Mim" the Herbalist** – A cunning woman who sells potions and remedies but also provides poisons and narcotics on the side. She may have used her skills to aid the hag or keep gang members in line. With Gareth gone, she’s now looking for a way to consolidate power.

**Tibault the Butcher** – A rough-handed, burly man who uses his shop as a front for stolen goods and money laundering. He handled the more violent side of the gang’s business but is more interested in self-preservation now that the hag is gone.

**Pierrot "The Weasel"** – A petty thief and pickpocket who worked as the gang’s runner, delivering messages and sneaking into places. He’s terrified now that the hag is gone and might be looking for protection—or revenge.

**Edouard the Ferryman**, a former member of Gareth’s now-defunct criminal gang, was working with the hag.

**Brigitte "Brick" Charpentier** – A towering, broad-shouldered woman with a broken nose and a thick, scarred forearm from a bad knife fight. She used to work as a carpenter’s apprentice but got kicked out after breaking a man's arm in a tavern brawl. Gareth recruited her for her strength, and she became the gang’s enforcer, collecting debts and roughing up troublemakers. Now that he’s dead, she’s uncertain—does she stay in Peydon and lay low, or take her skills elsewhere?

 **Noémie "Nox" Vallier** – A wiry, fast-moving brawler with a shaved head and sharp eyes. She grew up as a poacher and smuggler in the forests around Peydon, always skirting the law. Gareth saw her talent for ambushes and tracking, and she became the gang’s best at tailing people, sneaking into places, and making threats when needed. She never liked the hag, and with both Gareth and the witch gone, she’s trying to decide if Peydon is worth staying in—or if she should disappear before the town turns against the gang’s remnants.

### **Aveline D’Arques - Trade Broker and Merchant Liaison**
**Personality**: Aveline D'Arques is poised, charismatic, and effortlessly charming, with an almost magnetic ability to connect with others. She speaks with the smooth confidence of someone accustomed to negotiating deals and winning people over. Though she exudes warmth and politeness, there's a calculating edge to her—always assessing the room and the people in it, weighing her next move. Aveline is driven by ambition, and she presents herself as a dedicated servant to the town’s prosperity, though beneath her diplomatic demeanor lies a sharp, self-serving ambition. She is patient, manipulative when necessary, and enjoys having others depend on her expertise and judgment. Beneath her composed exterior, Aveline can be ruthless if it serves her interests.

**Physical Description**: Aveline is in her early thirties, with an elegant and graceful bearing. Her long chestnut hair is often styled in soft waves, and her sharp, intelligent brown eyes convey both warmth and calculation. Her features are delicate, with high cheekbones, full lips, and a radiant smile that comes easily—though it’s always tempered with a hint of something guarded. She dresses in fine, practical attire, favoring deep greens and rich blues that accentuate her striking appearance without seeming ostentatious. Her movements are measured and deliberate, and she carries herself with an air of someone accustomed to being both listened to and respected.

### The Party

**Brother Almeric (Temple Administrator)** – He’s relieved that the town is free of the hag’s shadow, though he may subtly warn the PCs that such darkness is never truly gone. He’s leading a toast to "Peydon’s salvation" and may hint that the town should return to proper faith and order.
    
- **Almeric (Temple Administrator)** – Leading a small prayer of thanksgiving before the festivities, but also subtly warning that darkness lingers in the world. He watches the crowd carefully, wary of lingering influences.
    
- **Ysanne the Shepherdess** – More relaxed than usual, but she still refuses to go near the old well. She’s celebrating because her flock has been calm for the first time in months. She’s brought fresh cheese to share.
    
- **Jehannot the Carter** – Drinking heavily but staying away from anything served in silver goblets. He’s celebrating the hag’s end but is still deeply unsettled. If approached, he mutters, _"Some things don’t just go away."_
    
	- **Guillaume the Woodcutter** – Sitting near the edge of the square, drinking quietly. He hasn’t joined the dancing but nods approvingly. He’s celebrating, in his own way, that whatever haunted him before is now gone. If pressed, he might hint that he once fought something unnatural in the woods.
    
- **Héloïse the Alewife** – Pouring ale and laughing, more genuinely than before. She’s grateful the town is free, but she occasionally glances over her shoulder out of habit. She encourages the PCs to drink and enjoy the night.
    
- **Marc and Eloi Delacroix (Millers)** – Eloi has come to the celebration, looking uncertain but relieved. Marc remains at the mill, too bitter to join. Eloi thanks the PCs and brings them a fine loaf of miller’s bread as a quiet gesture of gratitude.
	- Marc worked with Gareth and is ashamed of it
    
- **Angie Ravois (Baker)** – Handing out fresh pastries and trying to lighten the mood. She’s celebrating because, for the first time in ages, the town feels warm and full of life again. She urges the PCs to try her honey tarts—_"Best I’ve ever made, thanks to you."_
    
- **Apolline, the Young Mother** – Her baby, once sickly, has been thriving since the hag’s fall. She has made small charms for the PCs as a token of thanks.
    
- **Martine and Paul, the Dancing Siblings** – Leading a lively dance, laughing and pulling even the most reluctant villagers into the fun. They are celebrating their freedom from fear and want the whole town to embrace it.
	- **Cost:** The child recovered but no longer recognizes their mother, treating her like a stranger.

    
- **Gérard the Goatherd** – Enthusiastically celebrating, mostly because his goats are no longer acting strangely. He’s trying to teach the PCs a ridiculous folk dance involving exaggerated goat kicks.
	-     **Cost:** The limp is gone, but now their footsteps never make a sound—nor do they ever hear their own breath or heartbeat.

### Lords Household

**Lord Émeric Daverre** – The weary and aging lord of Peydon. After the undead attack, he made a desperate bargain with the hag, and it has taken a toll on him—his hair turned white overnight, and he often seems lost in thought. He remains lord in name, but his authority is waning as he avoids conflict and focuses on keeping the town stable. He is protective of his daughter, **Ysabeau**, and quietly fears she is next in the hag’s schemes.

**Lady Estelle Daverre**. Emeric's wife. 
**Lady Odile Daverre** Estelle's wife. 
**Arnault Daverre**, Emeric's husband. Dead. 

**Roland Vaissier** – The captain of the household guard. He was once a proud and disciplined knight, but after the undead rose, he became a broken man. He remains fiercely loyal to the lord but drowns his shame in drink, leaving his guards undisciplined. The hag taunts him in whispers only he hears. 

"I gave her my youth. She took it, and in return, she promised to protect the town from the undead, save my family, and give us peace. She bound my bloodline to the land, ensured it would remain strong and free of harm, and in return, I gave up my youth for the safety of those I love."

Servants and household staff. The lord's family has become withdrawn and hosts little and the household has shrunk.
Three servants: Cook, lady's maid, valet
Older son is traveling with Duke, feared dead in Fellburn or other battles, not clear of fate. He has a wife and child in Wisford
Older daughter killed along with her husband and two young children in the Ashecombe hills in the early fall by a wild bear.

- **Cook**: **Maudrine Lefevre** (she/her) _[MOHD-reen luh-FEH-vruh]_
    
    - A stout and friendly woman in her 50s, with a no-nonsense attitude when it comes to food. She’s been with the family for many years and considers the lord's family her own. Despite the troubles in the household, she’s always eager to provide a warm meal and some comfort to the villagers.
        
- **Lady’s Maid**: **Béatrice Roisier** (she/her) _[BAY-ah-trees RWAH-zyeh]_
    
    - A soft-spoken, elegant woman in her late 20s who has worked for the Daverre family for several years. She is loyal, but her eyes sometimes betray a subtle sense of unease, especially with all the strange events surrounding the household. She often whispers to the ladies of the house, offering advice or comfort in private.
        
- **Valet**: **Théophile Duval** (he/him) _[TAY-oh-feel doo-VAHL]_
    
    - A tall, lanky man in his 30s with an impeccable sense of dress. He used to be a minor nobleman’s servant before the Daverres took him in. His mannerisms are proper, but he’s a bit more playful than most servants. He’s excellent at gathering gossip and making light of the family’s more serious issues.


With the curse lifted, Lord Émeric might experience a complex mix of emotions as he is suddenly able to mourn the death of his husband, **Arnault**. Here’s how he might react:

1. **Overwhelming Grief**:
    
    - The flood of emotions could come all at once. After months or years of being unable to process his husband's death due to the curse, the weight of it might overwhelm him. He might find himself in tears unexpectedly, either in private or in a quiet moment during the celebration.
        
    - This could manifest as a feeling of _loss_—not just of his husband but also of all the time he was robbed of grieving. He may feel a bitter sense of injustice, not only for Arnault’s death but for the time lost while he was cursed.
        
    - He might pull away from the celebration for a moment, retreating to a quiet place like the manor’s garden or his chambers, needing to collect himself.
        
2. **Guilt**:
    
    - The realization that he never properly mourned his husband could bring guilt. He might feel as though he failed Arnault in some way by not grieving or being able to honor him properly.
        
    - He may confide in a trusted confidante or PC, saying something like, “I couldn’t even mourn him... The curse—” and trail off. This guilt could lead him to feel like a bad husband or leader, adding another layer of burden on his already weary heart.
        
3. **Relief and Confusion**:
    
    - There may be moments of quiet relief. For the first time in years, Lord Émeric might feel the freedom to think about his late husband without suffering physical pain. But there’s also a sense of confusion—he’s unsure how to process this new ability to mourn after being denied it for so long.
        
    - He could be unsure about how to move forward with his grief. Does he visit Arnault’s grave? Does he speak to his children about their father? It might feel like he’s walking through a fog, unsure of where to step.
        
    - He might seek solace in a private ritual, such as lighting a candle or speaking to his husband’s memory in a way that feels new and unfamiliar.
        
4. **Anger or Resentment**:
    
    - If he truly understands the extent of the hag’s influence, Lord Émeric could feel anger or resentment toward the hag, not only for the curse itself but for the years of emotional suppression. His anger might not be directed at his family or the villagers, but at the unseen force that manipulated him for so long.
        
    - This could lead him to become more bitter or withdrawn, as he wrestles with both the deep hurt of loss and the newfound awareness of the time taken from him.
        
5. **Desire for Closure**:
    
    - If the curse had prevented him from properly grieving, Lord Émeric might feel an urgent need for closure. He could want to visit Arnault’s grave, perhaps even speaking to him aloud for the first time.
        
    - This might happen in a quiet, personal moment, away from the public eye—he may tell the PC(s) that he wishes to do so and ask them to accompany him or act as witnesses to this intimate farewell.
        
6. **Connection to His Family**:
    
    - With the weight of the curse lifted, he might start to turn more toward his family, particularly his children. He may express a desire to properly _remember_ Arnault with them, to share stories or memories about their father.
        
    - This could spark a tender moment, where Lord Émeric shares how much his husband meant to him, or perhaps opens up about a time they were happy together.
        

In terms of your party scene, Lord Émeric could:

- **Step away** from the revelry, finding a quiet place to process his grief.
    
- **Start a private conversation** with a PC, sharing his feelings or seeking comfort, and giving them an opportunity to express sympathy or offer their support.
    
- **Have a quiet moment with Ysabeau** or another family member, perhaps mentioning Arnault’s name and allowing for some shared memory or sentiment.
