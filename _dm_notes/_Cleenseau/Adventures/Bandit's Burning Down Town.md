Gentza was investigating cures to poisoning. 



Level 2:

Basic goal: a set of bandits, hired via several middle men, are being paid to burn down Clenseau. 

Their plan:

-   Acquire poisons/disease agents from lizard folk under duress/trickery. Leave behind dead body (Oct 24rd)
    
-   Poison the town guard during a big festival; everyone is sick (Oct 26th)
    
-   Cause a diversion - current plan is a fake spider attack in Taviose, given recent events. Targeted diversion.
    
-   Sneak into town the next night and start some fires
    
-   One of the bandits has joined the town guard. Came to town this winter. Will open the gate.
    

  

April 14tth, Sunday, is a feast day. The poison will be spread that day. Sickness starts that night, and spreads widely on April 15th. April 15th late at night (early the morning of April 16th) is when the diversion + fires will start.

  

Their lair:

-   West of town, in an old Ankheg tunnel they have improved upon.
    
-   They mostly hang out there during the day. Often drinking. Give some random chance of each being drunk when attacked. Will not be drunk on April 15th
    
-   Treasure:
    

-   Flute of charming, long rest attune to a specific creature type, casts charm monster once a day. Hidden in the barrel of water
    
-   500 gold in mixed coins
    
-   Eversmoking bottle
    
-   Alchemy Jug
    
-   Two potions of greater healing
    
-   Remnants of enraging elixir
    

-   Some kind of trap in the little room to the west
    
-   Could collapse the whole thing maybe?
    

  

Ways to discover them:

-   Reports of thievery along the river from Aulout. Could follow upriver and discover bandit lair if good survival roll. Would need to actually be asking around in Aulout
    
-   Ganboa is dealing with a dead lizardfolk. Again, if asking around to other towns, they would hear. Some decent survival or investigation rolls, or just cleverness, suggests killer had a boat, came from upriver. Also can learn rumors of poison
    
-   Fey - some kind of fey friend of Perrin is around. Goes to festival. They notice at festival, she gives them some kind of hint about the grain. Tracking grain leads to lizardfolk, leads to dead body. Most likely hint is vague enough that it is too late to prevent sickness, and perhaps only obvious when people start getting sick
    
-   Other less likely possibilities: 
    
-   Investigating newcomers could lead to the new guard person; high insight or other face skills could make them suspicious
    
-   Random paranoia about the festival could let them see the poisoner, if they are watching for it and roll decent
    
-   Tracking the grain even without a hint could lead to lizardfolk and onward
    
-   Hunting remaining spiders will bring them to lizardfolk swamp
    

  

If discovered before the morning of the 14th, bandits are in lair, each one 50% chance of drunk.

If discovered on the 14th, two of them are out poisoning. Rest each have 25% of being drunk.

If discovered after the 14th, before the night of 15th, all in lair, none drunk.

  

Lair attack plays out per encounter.

  

Two other possibilities:

  

-   Fall for diversion. Come back to fire; could use magic to help put it out. Aftermath one of the guards is gone, and lizard folk will come forward (on the 16th late afternoon).
    

-   Lair is abandoned on the 17th early morning, bandits disperse west, Ankheg still there.
    
-   How bad the fire is depends a lot on the PCs, if they don’t do much, burns half the town
    

-   Don’t fall for diversion. Are present when bandits attack. Bandits will, if they are threatened, try to divert PCs with fire and then flee to various points, returning to lair evening next day (16th). 
    

-   Debate over what they should do next resolves with them fleeing west on the 17th, early morning
    
-   Lair is then abandoned, again, save for ankheg
    

  

Social encounters at the beginning:

-   Fey person is here
    

-   Audience with Rosalind
    
-   Audience with Eremon
