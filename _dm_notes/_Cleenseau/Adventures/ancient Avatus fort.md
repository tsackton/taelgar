It is 35' underground, and the walls are mostly a weirdly hard dirt, but which can be cracked with a DC 18 STR check or similar application of force

Cracked in some spots, where there are little piles of dirt or minor collapses, animal burrows, etc

Basic layout:

* Straight tunnel runs from a large room just riverside of the Bandit's Rest west-north-west, where a room under approximately the rich set of houses is. From there
	* one branch runs north east, and dead ends about 2500' in a major collapse
	* one branch runs north west, under the "basements section" of the Sembaran fort and dead ends under about where the main road is now
	* one branch runs west north west, skirting under the old Sembaran fort before turning more due west gradually rising and ending in farmland about 3000' later. The last 8' or so are dirt, but it could be dug out

Encounters and interesting bits:
* There isn't much down here. The bit under the basements/section road is the most damaged and has lots of rat holes and things springing off it
	* Decent change of random encounter with zombie rats here
* Under the fort connects with the crypt/water damage/recent collapse. Historically the crypt was about 8' above the tunnel
* North east branch is pretty boring
* Then there are the 3 rooms: staging room, landing room with dim.door, fort with original of bad and wight
