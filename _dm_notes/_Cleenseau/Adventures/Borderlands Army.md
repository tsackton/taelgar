### Create Goal
Decide whether to hinder or help the Army of South
### Define Central Conflict and Rough Plot
Borderlands Army of the South appears. By this point there should be information from Embry indicating some type of issues and information from Rinburg with the Duke trying to regroup/take command.

There is no real "conflict" in the sense that this is ultimately a moral/character dilemma, not a "game" dilemma

This happens in game on Jan 26 - 27

The news here is basically that they were sent south, on reports that an outpost of the Shattered Ice clan was active again in the borderlands, and hobgoblins were building an army in secret. They never found anything, ended up dividing up into squads, communication and so on difficult, some bad luck (river crossing, bear) but no skeletons.

By this point there are orders for the Army of the West & South to be punished/disbanded/reformed.

#### Names
* Baronies & Army people
* About 18 stragglers of a unit of ~100
