Dungeon Crawl Under the Town

This is designed to be a relatively extensive scenario with a large dungeon under the city mostly populated with various undead.

Background

The lich king has cast some sort of magical spell that has awakened certain ancient dead things all over the kingdom. It works in fits and starts and some degree of randomness, but under Cleenseau, it has awakened an undead plague, which turns creatures into zombies. It is old and weak and so can't infect everyone -- most people with strong immune systems are just ill for a bit -- but it particularly can infect babies, and it crosses the placental barrier so pregnant women can pass it to their children. It also impacts the old or the already ill.

The plague rots the victim, turning them into a plague carriering zombie. However, it attenuates somewhat, so it can't go the next level, i.e. it infects someone, and anyone they kill gets zombiefied, but those zombies don't then go on to infect other zombies.

The source is in the old Avatus lair underneath the Drankorian fort. This is connected to the under Cleenseau tunnels by a dimension door, which is only partly working. So for 6 hours every day, from 4pm - 10pm, it is open, and there is a 75% chance plague will drift through (as spores).

From their, it drifts through the various old tunnels (see below) and ends up coming out into Cleenseau, where it in turn might infect someone.


Tunnels Under Cleenseau

There are three significant interesting things under Cleenseau

* The old hobgoblin fort.
	* At the base, underneath the motte, was a large Sembaran, basically a keep. The hobgoblins buried this under the motte, and built 3 towers rising up from it, each of which reached the top of the motte
	* At the ground level, from the motte was a bailey built with various bits of Sembaran fort
	* One of the towers was connected to the keep underground and was the main entrance out to the baily
	* One of the other towers was isolated
	* The 3rd tower was connected to the keep as well
	* underhill was built on top of the hobgoblin fort, so a couple of basements are connected to the roofs of old buildings. in Some cases there are hard to navigate passages between them but it is all pretty full of dirt, but cracks and rat dens and so on stuff do let spores through. 4 buildings in particular, two via rats, two more open. One of the more open is Tumbledown, which connects to trails. The other is someone's house who is beatrix neighbor which connects via the basement to the roof of the underground entrance and then onward to the main place


* This is in bad shape in some places, but has 2 levels under the motte, plus some ruins under Underhill -- 
	* the top level connects via secret passageway to the basement of Essford manor. This is actually well hidden and not known to the Essfords, this was connecting to the part of Essford manor that used to be part of the hobgoblin fort (the basements, basically). 
	* the next level was part of hobgoblin fort and is underneath the level of the motte, it was basically the basement of the Sembaran fort that the hobgoblins buried when building the motte
	* In Underhill 
* The old halfling tunnels, which connect to the Crossroads Inn basement. They branch off from the tunnel Celyn found, connect with several basements in G and A, and then turn towards the river, where the tunnels become collapsed and impassible. It used to come out by the river under the bridge where humans would flee the Avatus-era city
* The Avatus tunnels. There is a large staging area significantly underground of K/L/wall in that area, with the dimension door to a basement of the ruined fort under the Drankorian towers. From the staging area, there are three tunnels that used to go far underneath Cleenseau and emerge on the north side at 3 places. The emergence points are long buried and totally inaccessible, and this is underneath everything else and not directly accessible. However, a group of hobgoblin wights tunneled up from here to the old fort, which formed the passage
