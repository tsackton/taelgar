Levels: 1 and 2

Hoard of spiders attacks from the forest. Centered around Taviose.   

Basic notes on Ettercap lair:

-   Much of the forest is impenetrable without spells or special skills. Think brush, brambles, etc
-   Whole area is dim light -- visibility is only about 15 feet
-   East and west are particularly tightly covered with brambles and thick webs, very hard to penetrate
-   North has three giant wasp nests in an arc, each with 2, 4, and 2 giant wasps. These are guardians, and if distrubed will go berserk and attack. Simple-minded, no tactics, typically attack whoever attacked them last. Poison is slightly nerfed, DC 9, damage is 1d6-1.
-   South is a branching maze of passage ways through the forest coated in webs and web traps

Three types of webs:

-   No effect
-   DC 11 CON save or 1d3 poison damage and poisoned for 1 hour
-   DC 11 STR save or restrained, action to try again
-   Ettercap can sense creatures who are restrained, and sends spiders to attack them

Population of lair is 3 giant spiders, 8 wolf spiders, and ettercap -- direct combat likely to be death. Ettercap dies, they disburse into the woods, can be hunted down one by one

-   Bounty of 50 gp for ettercap, 20 gp for each spider    
-   Stealth or bypassing traps and finding the ettercap directly 
-   NPC: 3 guards, 1 soldier
  
Upcoming attacks:

- Attack #3 - already happened, on Ganboa
- Attack #4 - midnight 10/22, on Valit
- Attack #5 - daytime 10/24, Cleenseau

Killing the ettercap will stop the spiders from attacking — the spiders are being encouraged/controlled/driven by the ettercap and bred to some extent.   

Without ettercap they can be hunted down in the forest relatively easily. 

Goals - role play working with the town introduced to leadership of town make place for themselves. Challenge is really how much the PCs do vs town. Well played defense of town and/or attack on ettercap works out well. 

If the PCs don’t do much a town patrol goes into the forest after attack #4 and doesn’t return. 
  
If the PCs still don’t do much attack #5 kills most of Tavoise. 
  
After attack #5 the area lords meet and eventually a militia goes into forest with about 70 guairds and peasants. Defeats the ettercap but takes heavy losses (40 people). 

If attack #5 fails ettercap retreats far into wood. 
 
Ettercap was summoned by some kind of bad guy in the area causing all these problems who works for lich king.

* 4 dead in first attack
* 3 dead in second attack
* 2 dead in ganboa attack
