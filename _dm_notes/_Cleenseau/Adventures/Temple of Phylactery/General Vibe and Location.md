Tharwa FÃ«a  (THAR-wah FAY-ah)

Three leaders:
* A Lakan monk
* A Stoneborn from the Sentinels
* An elven wizard from Orenlas

All partially recruited by Malach.

Compound is about 2 dozen houses and support buildings, all same size and style, plus two large buildings:

* Library and laboratory
* A mystical sanctum

The surface buildings are basically all just ruins - some evidence of old habitation but really not very much. 

Raoul has two companions: a steely eyed woman - barbarian path of the zealot and a warlock celestial patron - Annabelle and Lucien
baddy - ancient thingy from D&D and a shadow hunter from D&D beyond

Gate challenge - "show soul", basically originally created as a protection around the original place of scholars and it has never been removed, although it has been corrupted so that it now opens for anyone not just those with good intentions, mechanism is probing questions re: life and death and souls

Doors in basement is the names challenge from chat gpt, basically four doors: past, present, future, forgotten

Entry way - lots of statues, slowly looking, eyes - three different types of statues, "evil" (paralyzing beam dc 15 wis save; or necrotic damage per turn), "agnozied" (psychic damage, mind screams, panic and fear), "resisting" (nothing bad)

Main interesting places:

Basic structure: need to get through the gate, avoid the sancturum, avoid the shadow hunter (or kill it), enter the library, find the binding chamber, avoid Umkidza whisphers, find the key, find the secret chamber, defeat the guardian

Distractions: the mediation and study rooms; the library, which has been ramsacked by Isabeau but has haunted moments and areas, 

Challenges: Entrance gate (fog, riddle); hall of statues (fake doors, past/pres/future); unlbinking eyes (main ent)

* Gate itself - self-knowledge, somewhat corrupted
* Sanctum - one room - illusion 
* Library and laboratory
* Level 1: top area is the main library; bottom right is study and private meditation rooms; bottom left is "secret" library; entrance hall is entrance hall
* Level 2: library 2nd part; more study and mediation rooms; library 2nd part; sanctum of some sort above secret
* Basement: hall of statues: three fake doors; real door  goes to summoning and binding chamber - which is darkest and weirdest room, most corrupted - but contains a key or similar that opens the secret doors
