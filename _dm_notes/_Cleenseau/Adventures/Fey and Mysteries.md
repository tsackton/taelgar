In the Army:

Lots of complaints and mixups three companies from Enst where sent to Dunfry and five companies from Dunfry to Enst, lots of back and forth and hurry up and wait. Rumors of an attack way up the North Fork, but no one was there because of miscommunication. Ida feels she should have been sent to the Enford garrison, not Dunfry at all.
