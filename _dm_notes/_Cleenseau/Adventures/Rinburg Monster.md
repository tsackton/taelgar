### Create Goal
Defeat the strange lake monster in Rinburg
### Define Central Conflict and Rough Plot

### Define the "scenes"
Information gathering in Rinburg and environs, including potentially working with Corrine (or not)

This is going to be structured as a combat-heavy 5 room dungeon with heavy set of complications/wandering monsters. The basic setup:

* Any time someone spends more than ~1 hour on the lake surface the zombie eel bursts up through the water and attacks the ship
* If in "attack" mode it is skittish and will run at first blood; in its lair it will fight to the death

The main locations are:

* The shipwreck surface. This is overgrown with weeds and seaweed type things, hard to see. Some eels and zombies
* The smaller ship's hold. This is where the dead adventures are and the harder encounter below.
* The larger ship hold. Tight quarters. 
* Lair entrance and lair.

Need to think about environmental hazards. There isn't a lot of room for roleplaying but there should be some non-combat environmental hazards.
### Define the "roster" and "complications"
There are several creatures in the ruined ship:
* [[Underwater Zombie]] (gang)
* [[Eel Swarm]] (group)
* [[Eel-Infected Zombie]] (group)

### Encounters
Initial forays
* 2 [[Eel Swarm]] (dead)
* 4 [[Underwater Zombie]] and a [[Eel Swarm]] 
* 1 [[Eel-Infected Zombie]] and 4 [[Underwater Zombie]]  (dead)

Harder:
* 5 [[Underwater Zombie]] and a [[Eel Swarm]] and  [[Eel-Infected Zombie]]

Boss

Complications and annoyances:
* Dangers of the sea
* Dangers of the wreck
* 2x Eel Swarms
* 4x zombies
* Warnings of big boss guy

* Collapsing debris / shipwreck piece
* Chunk of rotting flesh from eel
* Cold patch. Cold current/cold patch; DC 11 CON save or 1d6 dmg
* Darkness. 
* Riptides/Strong Current. DC 13 STR save; swept away; disorienting

Water Currents/Riptides Have areas with strong underwater currents that could sweep characters away if they fail Strength checks. Riptides near underwater entrances could be treacherous.

Zero-Visibility Zones Create pitches of total blackness the party must navigate using sound/echolocation, or by string/rope guides. Disorienting and ripe for getting lost.

Underwater Structural Hazards Unstable floors that could collapse, falling debris to avoid, tunnels that could cave in, or rooms that may start taking on water and flood.

Treacherous Footing Areas of slippery algae, loose rocks, soft silt that characters need to cross while avoiding falls.

Toxic Environmental Effects Patches of murky, acidic water that damages, numbing cold waters that reduce dexterity, or areas with magical environmental effects.
