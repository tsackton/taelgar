Session 135

## RAW NOTES ##

Start on Sept 14th in Orenlas
Two days in Orenlas:
- dewalth talk to elves about where the elves went
- wellby gets through to the fly, sees that is still remembers Agata fondly, and realizes he needs to shift its opinion to get through to it (and also show it a new home with him)
- seeker prepare chaos metal for plane shift. practice making stable stone shapes
- kenzo communes with the elder tree

Delwath plane shifts to "a sanctuary that would be safe for Kenzo"

arrive in cutting-glass-snow, taking slashing damage
Seeker quickly shapes a cotton / soft nest of the snow, forming a protective sphere of influence; kenzo tries to commune with nature but takes psychic damage from limbo
wellby shoots arrrow to find rai, 47 distance-units away
emerge from snow-glass-ice into a black field dotted with bursts of blue flame. send arcane eye to investigate. proceed.
wellby notices some patches of solidifying air, suggesting the landscape is about to change
darkness begins to solidify into stone, seeker turns the cloud nest into child's drawing of a ship on a sea with clear sky above
sail through the stone in the bubble/window, watching little stone bird that look like drawings drift across the sky
arcane eye tests in random directions - two end up in stone
third arcane eye shows a two floating rows of trees arranged in two neat lines

take shape down to the silence orchard -- two lines of fruit trees growing in a shard of glass dirt, tended by a faceless robed caretaker. 
two rules: no faces and no names
kenzo controls his appearance to hide his face using his void/meditation thoughts
seeker tries but mind too chattery / busy; orchard keeper helps
delwath uses alter self to turn face silver
wellby wraps a scarf around his face which merges with his skin as he steps onto the orchard

talk briefly - kenzo accidentally asks about the Material Plane, gets banished (proper noun is not okay)n - manages to return but warned that he is allowed only one mistake or the stability of the island will fall
knows vaguely about the jade man but does not spend time worrying about his conflict with limbo

can harvest fruits by thinking of what you want. orchard keeper hands them a pomegranate that shows a map of rai's sanctuary but they don't realize what it is
seeker creates a melon showing the monk's monastery in limbo with the monks doing repetitive tasks; also a flaming apple that shows Frankar and an efreeti walking across an ashy field to a giant chalice with flames shooting out the top on the plane of fire
try a dragonfruit of cha'mutte's lair - but nothing; the orchard keeper tells them that ruins can't exist in limbo - without a will everything decays to the primal chaos
wellby summons a banana that sings a melody from the orchard keeper's childhood which sounds alien and strange; seeker summons a fruit that shows his home and it is empty, hollow

asked about cha'mutte - he does not recall but then eats a fruit and restores his memory of fleeing cha'mutte some years ago; cha'mutte wanted to use all the power of limbo 

everyone takes one fruit - kenzo chaos ki; seeker glass dirt; wellby nut of escape route; delwath fruit to help find elves. kenzo communes with tree. 

teleport to rai's sanctuary - amazing success but much further away (417 distance-units). appear at a conduit of liquid gravity that pulls towards a floating array of structures. monastery flashes past; party is pulled in to the center (all fail save). seeker tries to shape vindristrjarna, but it is too complicated, end up falling on a flat stone expanse. 

flat stone expanse is closer - 95 distance units. take damage falling though. 

travel on ocean for a bit, see a wave of stone following them. distance closes unpredictably. 

wellby and bow notice stone boar like shapes unudualating at the front of the stone wave (like the horses in lord of the rings that gandalf makes)

seeker manages to make a gap appear in the water in their wake. world rotations. boars keep following the gap, ship goes perpendicular towards rai.

reach sanctuary. see the cloud-waterfall-glass

enter, first find just grasping hands, seeking stories of thresholds. 
seeker - door in eudomes' tower (history)
wellby - canyonlands from very beginning of campaign (survival)
delwath - rainbow bridge, stories of when they escaped from danger, especially plane of water

second circle - faces of emotion. 
kenzo mediates on a laughing face, gets its story back (father and child)
delwath uses suggestion on grieving face, magics it into showing its story (carving death marker / dunmari religion)
wellby - joy - story of the beauty of the dunmari landscape, rolled really high so works even though the joy was really about her wedding. 
seeker - terror - fear of all kinds of dangerous things (arcana), totally misses the brief but so good at communicating the detail of these things that the monk remembers its fear of public speaking and is saved

last circle - monks imitating roles, half formed
wellby - sparring partner, spars with it
delwath - teacher, acts as student to learn about how to survive on limbo
seeker - student, acts as teacher about the history of tokra, digressions pull student along
kenzo - prayer, locks into the communion of advanced bhishma monks, succeeds with help of inspiration

enter monastery - monks doing routine ritals to preserve order in the face of limbo

speak to Rai - 
he had cast a desperate message to dimitaur to look for help; dimitaur didn't deliver but help came anyway
he has been fighting to keep some ancient limbo entity from taking full control over the relic of reshaping and crashing limbo further into material plane, and also fighting to keep monks safe. can't go fight ancient thing - monks would die; can't teleport away with monks - ancient thing would win

tells of chaos storms - the "final form" of chaos beasts - thinks the entity with the relic is a chaos storm caught in the window of stability, remembered itself

END
