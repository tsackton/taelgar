Basic idea:

There is a (goblin? something else?) who is basically a mad scientist, has acquired a pet basilisk and is turning people to stone for their garden/research/whatever

They have strong-armed a local goblin community to help with their raiding, letting the goblins have the treasure in exchange for help with the banditry. Some of the goblins are excited about this and amused about the "humans getting their commuppence", others are nervous this is too dangerous and it is going to come back to bite them, and/or worried about the intentions of the leader.

Basic adventure is the level 2 lair in Where Evil Lies, but with a different map, a basilisk instead of a giant spider, potentially a different boss. 

Might also add another layer of enemies, some kind of lingering creature from the location before it was the lair of the villain. 

The lair is based in an old, abandoned palace, build before the great war during the height of Cymea's wealth and power, as the "country retreat" for a rich merchant family. it is about 40 miles from the coast, near ~river~. 

After the Great War, the heirs fell on hard times, and sold the property. Some stone was salvaged, but then the new owners died without heirs, and the palace fell into disrepair. By 1620 or so, it was largely without a roof, and unclaimed. 

In the 1660s, it was reoccupied by a medusa, who made it her lair for 30 years, during which time it acquired a reputation as a cursed place, and fell further into disrepair. The medusa eventually succumbed to her reflection, caught unexpectedly by the water in a fountain. 

In the 1700s, a group of pirates and bandits moved in and made it a hideaway. The leader was killed by the Tollender Navy in the 1720s, and the lair was gradually abandoned. It has sat empty for the last 20 years, until recent events. 

Layout of the space:
- originally, was a palace/villa with gardens, a road leading up the valley, a fortified gate, a fancy garden, a villa with a courtyard, and few outbuildings. [like this](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/italian-renaissance-villas-and-gardens/) 
- walls were plundered after Great War
- during medusa days, everything crumbled, but no plunder. new statues added to garden, in odd places/poses
- during bandit days, a crude wall was reconstructed, roofs were repaired on some outbulidings, and some underground hideouts were dug
- now, underground hideouts have been expanded, by and for goblins; roofs repaired again; part of courtyard turned into basilisk pit; part of villa repaired for boss

general setup:
- outbuildings 1 - first area - one of the outbuildings now doubles as a prison where prisoners waiting to be petrified are kept. three rooms - prison room, guard room, something else, maybe stormroom-ish?
- gardens
- outbuildings 2 - storerooms 

encounters:
- 6 to 8 points per day; probably aim for 6 day 1 and 6-8 day 2, will need to figure out a place they can rest safely

- cr 3ish boss, with maybe 1-3 cr 1/2 or less lackeys (4ish points)
- cr 3ish basilisk (3ish points)
- goblin guards (2ish points)
- goblin main room (2ish points)
- third goblin encounter (1ish points)
- weird haunting encounter (2ish points)
- one more easy encounter (1sh points)
