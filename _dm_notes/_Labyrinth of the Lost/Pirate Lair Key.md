The Perdoli manor had a bolt hole under the master bedroom, designed as a place to hide if needed. The pirates started to expand this, and broken through into a small cave system, which is now Grimstone's lair. 

If undead are quieted and Arturo neutralized, anywhere in the lair is safe for a short rest, but not a long rest. 

![[Pirate Lair.png]]

## C1 : Bolthole
- Perdoli built; no treasure, clearly looted. Passage in the north wall is smashed through the wall and crudely dug.
## C2: Cave Entrance
- Rope ladder hangs to cave below, about 30 foot drop into a large dark cavern
- Cavern is unlit
- Sight of pirate massacre a generation ago by the Tollen Navy; fireball cast down here killed everyone. Now undead, but don't fully realize. Will challenge: "Who goes there" and allow those who have the right response to pass. Requires good rolls or clever plan to succeed here, shouldn't be easy to avoid the fight. However shouldn't be super-difficult to get the jump on them with ranged weapons. 

Combat:
(**stats:** Flee, Mortals)
- 5 shade minions (CR 1)
- 2 shadows (CR 1)

Treasure:
- nothing, but can decipher what happened here
## C3: Entrance Hall
- Pirates did not improve/change this cave. Now it is the "entrance hall" to Grimstone's lair. A somewhat miserable human servant sleeps here - straw bedding in one corner. Lit by torchlight. 
- Arturo: human brawler, kind of like Amos in the Expanse, did some bad things in his past and trusted Grimstone to be is moral compass, but increasingly feeling squeamish about what is going on.

Combat:
(**stats:** Flee, Mortals)
- Brawler (CR 2)

Treasure:

## C4: Treasure Vault
- Two large chests, both locked and trapped. Grimstone has the only key. 
- Lit by torchlight
- Was once pirate storeroom, but pirate goods have been well-looted. Careful search can reveal, however, a scattering of older Tollender coins (122 sp, 23 gp) that were missed in previous searches.

Trap:
- DEX Save (DC 15), on fail hit with poison dart, does 2d6 poison damage and poisoned for 1 hour
- DC 14 to disarm, fail by 5 or more sets off trap
- DC 13 Investigation to notice trap
- DC 15 lockpicking

Same trap on both chests

Treasure:
this is the bulk of the valuable stuff that Grimstone has stolen
- 244 gp, a dozen small garnets (10 gp each), necklace of pearls (common art object)- first chest

Second chest:
- ring of birdcalls
- charlatan's die
- six wooden goblets (24 gp each), each with two pieces of turquoise set into its stem
- silver decanter [43 gp] sitting on the top shelf. It is about 8 inches tall and 4 inches wide. A scene of a stag standing in a glade is carved into it with exacting detail. On the shelf below you find 5 books [17 gp each]. Each book is bound in hard, dark leather and contains 100 pages. These leaves are empty, so they could be used as new spellbooks, diaries, or map books

## C5: Grimstone's Chambers
- Dark, unless Grimstone is here. Lantern for light.
- Crude bed, and many scattered papers and maps
	- Lots of notes on research about: 
		- medusa lairs, including many rumors about this one
		- basilisks, how to catch and keep them
		- alchemical formulae, many involving basilisk parts
		- speculation about "The Stone of the Prime," or the "Prime Arcana Stone," said to be a mystical substance, theorized to be a special kind of rock or stone, that when powdered allows the creation of powerful potions and elixirs. 
		- covered in notes: transmutation of flesh embodies the essence of flesh; stone from magic IS magic; the prime essence is the living soul, so living stone must be the answer (*basic idea is he is somehow convinced that petrified people are the key to the Prime Arcana Stone*)
		- some evidence of frustration: "this stone is too old, too decayed; weathered and destroyed; pirate rabble smashed it all anyway; I need fresh stone"
- Chest, unlocked with clothes and mundane personal goods
## C6: Grimstone's Lair
- Chaotic laboratory. 
- Two workbenches have alchemist's gear. Lots of powdered rock, in different little lead and pewter dishes, with various acids scattered around in glass jars. A beaker is bubbling and hissing producing some kind of gas. 
- Grimstone is here, at work. 

Combat:
- Grimstone (aim for CR 3)

Glowing Poison Recipe
Injury Poison

This one-page recipe is written in fine calligraphy on a sheet of clean white parchment. If you are proficient with alchemist’s supplies or a poisoner’s kit, you can make a dose of this poison with raw materials worth 250 gp and 1 hour of uninterrupted work.

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 8 hours. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. While poisoned in this way, a creature sheds bright green light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Any attack roll against the poisoned creature has advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible or hide from creatures who can see.

Additionally, the creature leaves a glowing green trail whenever they move. The trail lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned.
