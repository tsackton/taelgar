# Overview

The general layout is a ruined villa. Unless otherwise indicated, buildings lack roofs and are in a serious state of disrepair. Gardens are overgrown, etc.

The manor grounds are generally protected by isolation, not active defenses. There is a partial wall that extends along the south of the manor, near the [[Key - LL#Entry Gardens|Entry Gardens]], but there is no gate or barrier, just an open archway. 

Atmosphere is run down, but once was fancy. Marble, crumbled bits of fancy fountains and other sculpture, etc. More detail are in specific features below. 

## Developments
- Folcan will keep his end of the bargain through the night and into the next morning. However, middle of next day, spies from Ulgna's loyalists will see the prison cell is empty, and get nervous. Folcan will also begin to panic when a hobgoblin comes asking about the delivery tomorrow. This will cause the following to happen after dark on Sat night:
	- A hobgoblin patrol will go searching for both escaped prisoners and goblins
	- Ulgna and her goblins will flee in the tunnels towards the hills
	- Folcan and his goblins will try to track down party, searching Sat night in the tunnels for them, and hope to capture them and bring them back to the prison
## Roster and Patrols

There is a single hobgoblin (**hobgoblin smokebinder**) that watches the grounds (on rotation; passive perception 11), to keep an eye out for escaping prisoners, and make sure no one disturbs  Grimstone (or Lord Rockbinder as he calls himself). If the party attempts a short or long rest in a place that is not safe to do so, they are interrupted by this patrol on a roll of 3 or less (on d6). if the manor is  on alert, this increases to 5 or less (on a d6) for long rests only. If spotted, this hobgoblin will not engage, but will warn the manor. 

There are also three hobgoblins who guard the gate (**hobgoblin incendiarist**), with orders to shoot anyone who flees. The guards watch the gate carefully, and it would be difficult to sneak out without invisibility. They also keep an eye on the [[Key - LL#Entry Gardens|Entry Gardens]]. Anyone trying to pass through the gates or the front door of the manor, or otherwise travel through the entry gardens, must pass a DC 15 group stealth check or be spotted. 
## Goblin Knowledge

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check convinces a captured or cornered goblin to give up one of the following pieces of information:
- Grimstone doesn't let the goblins in the manor, but once every week the prisoners are driven up to the manor, and never return. The goblins have never seen Grimstone without his robes and mask - he wears a pure white marble death mask and black robes that drape heavily on his body, like they are made of lead. The name Grimstone comes from the marble death mask. 
- He has a hobgoblin lieutenant who takes pleasure in beating the goblins and is the go-between
- The goblins keep all the treasure they find, except for gold, which must be turned in to Grimstone. The goblins are paid in rations and drinks as long as they provide one prisoner per week. They built the prison to reduce the need to raid, they can drag four or five people back and be done for a month. 
- The wine cellar leads into the manor, but no one dares go up the stairs
- There are creepy statues in the garden
### Basic goblin factions

There is one group, led by Folcan (cursespitter) and including the guards at the prison, who are perfectly happy working from Grimstone, think it is easy work and/or like their drink a bit too much. They won't fight to the death, but they won't betray him readily, and will try to sound the alarm.

There is a second group, led by Ulgna (bonesplitter), and including the guards outside the barracks and many of the lackey minions, who hate the hobgoblin, thought they were free of hobgoblins and wanted to live in peace. They are not exactly good people - happy to raid - but would prefer to be raiding on their own. Got caught up in this because Folcan and Ulgna knew each other, and Folcan invited Ulgna to come stay, and now she is afraid to leave. Will be more than happy to run if feels like the party is going to cause enough chaos that Grimstone and his hobgoblin lieutenant won't chase after her. 
## History

The Perdoli Manor (*Pehr-DOH-lee*) was build in 1479, by the wealthy Perdoli family, merchants and traders. Got rich off wine and control over a marble quarry in the hills, built manor as a place to relax and get away, about a day's journey into the hills from Vistalba. 

The family enjoyed the manor for several generations, until the Great War. The Perdoli family faired poorly, and came out of the Great War having lost much of their wealth (details don't really matter). A few years after the Great War, forced to sell the villa. The new owners were not much better, and never lived there, and couldn't afford the upkeep. Some stone was scavenged during this time, but it was too far away to be convenient. The new owners died without heirs, living the manor to fall into disrepair and ruin in the 1590s. 

It stood empty save from occasional wandering travelers seeking shelter far from home for the next 30 years or so, generally falling out of memory of the local villagers, who had other problems to deal with. 

In the 1620s, the manor was reoccupied by a medusa, who made it her lair for 30 years, during which time it acquired a reputation as a cursed place, and fell further into disrepair. The medusa eventually succumbed to her reflection, caught unexpectedly by the water in a fountain. While she lived there, some crude repairs were made to the manor, scavenging stone from outbuildings as needed. 

In the 1690s, a group of pirates and bandits fleeing the beginnings of Tollender persecution moved in and made it a hideaway for the next 15 years or so. They dug tunnels and built a secret room behind the wine cellar to store treasure, and repaired the smithy/forge and parts of the manor, in a crude fashion. The leader was killed by the Tollender Navy in the 1720s, and the lair was gradually abandoned. 

It has sat empty since then, until recent events. 
## Resting

If the building is on alert, the only safe places to rest are those that can be hidden or fortified. The barracks and the smithy, if cleared of goblins, can be fortified (requires blocking the tunnel for the barracks). Additionally, the secret area in the manor (H15) is always safe as no one knows about it, as is the chapel crypt. 

If the building is not on alert, any quite place can be safe;
- Smithy if the guards are killed
- Tunnels
- Barracks if the goblins are killed or driven off
- Etc
# Smithy

The smithy roof was rebuild during the pirate occupation, and is obviously newer construction. The forge and workshop were also repaired, and largely date to ~30 years ago instead of 300. Now, the smithy and workshop are home to a crude prison where captives are kept until the weekly petrification ceremony. 

The walls are solid and the roof is sound if unattractive, so sound does not easily carry from this building. 
### S1: Forge

This room contains a crude prison, a forge and anvil, several crates, and various detritus. Any loud noise will draw one of the goblins from **S2** to investigate, but they are drunk so soft noises won't be investigated. 

*Prison:* The players awake in the prison. The south wall consists of iron bars, with a door that is locked with a crappy padlock. The goblins in **S2** have the key. The west wall is made of wood, repuposed from various workbenches and such. The floor of the prison is stone, but covered in dirt and grime. There is a small, barred window near the ceiling.
- There are two weak points that could be destroyed: 
	- one of the iron bars is rusty (DC 12 Perception check to notice), and a DC 15 Strength check could pry it loose, creating enough space for creatures to crawl out one at a time. Makes a loud noise, causing goblin in **S2** to investigate. 
	- the wood is rotten in one corner (DC 15 to notice); could kick it out, or slowly chip away. 
- The lock can be picked, DC 12 (it is not a hard lock), but requires tools of some kind. 
- Improvise other solutions, just see what they try. Generally DC should be between 10-15

*Anvil and Forge*: Scavenging this area can recover up to two usable sets of tools, of reasonable type. Can also find a variety of things that could become improvised weapons. Lots of various bits of scrap metal and such as well. 

*Crates:* Various bits of mundane equipment from the party and other prisoners are haphazardly tossed in here. Does not include weapons or armor or valuable treasure, but does include adventuring gear, tools, and other random things:
- mixed up an scattered parts of various tool sets, can sort and clean to make three usable tool sets
- three sets of thieves picks
- an herbalism kit
- a ledger book
- *John's arcane focus* 
- 14 waterskins in various conditions
- a crowbar
- a hammer and 10 pitons
- a stack of 17 torches and 8 tinderboxes
- two coils of rope (50 feet each)
- a sheaf of 20 pieces of blank paper
- mixed up bits of 9 mess kits

## **S2: Guard Room**

What was once the antechamber, store room, and staging area for the workshop has been converted to a guard room. Any noise in S2 is supposed to be investigated by Morky, who will do so very reluctantly, afraid the others are cheating. 

These goblins have been exiled here as a punishment for their snark against Grimestone. 

Bits of overheard info:
- "Stuck here for a stinking week! Damn that Ulgna! Why does Folcan listen to her in the first place, she doesn't even like working for Grimstone!"
- "Ha, yeah, its the easiest raiding in a while. One prisoner a week and all the brandy we can drink? Even worth putting up with that filthy Krekka. Glad we have Ulgna and her buddies to draw his ire!"
- "It's your fault Morky, shoulda kept your mouth shut about that stupid dog. Grimstone wouldn't care if Ulgna kept it!"
- "At least we've got brandy, and good thing that fool lizardfolk had cards on him! Gives us something to do."
- "Which one of the latest batch should we give to Grimstone when he down in two days? I vote the lizardfolk, he probably eats the most anyway and I don't like the look of him. I bet we can keep that scrawny halfling alive for weeks on stale bread and rotting meat, ha ha."
- "Shut it, you're stalling - place your bet already! And give me more of that brandy."
- "You shut it, you've drunk too much already, this barrel has to last us the week!"

(the basic idea is these are Grimstone loyalists, the main goblin leader wanted to keep the dog, they told Grimestone about it, and in exchange the main leader is making them watch the prisoners, "If you care so much about what Grimestone thinks, you watch his prisoners")

No one particularly likes these goblins so no one will check up on them for at least 24 hours. 

This room has the following features:

- “Raucous laughter and the smell of strong liquor fills this small chamber. Three bantering goblins sit on the dirt floor, rolling bright green dice and gambling copper pieces.”
- “A barrel at the north end of the room is labeled, ‘House Caford / Old Caford Thunder.’”

Goblin Party. Morky (a goblin assassin) is beating Norrica (a goblin underboss) and Skelver (a goblin warrior) in a dice game. ***All three are drunk and considered poisoned.*** They’re supposed to watch the door to the prison (area S1), but are absorbed in their game, jokes, and liquor. A character can sneak by them with a successful DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check.  

Norrica has a shortsword (one of Loria's), a shield, and studded leather armor. Also has Loria's shortbow. 
Morky has a scimitar and three dagger, and studded leather
Skelver has Loria's other shortsword, leather armor, and a shield. Plus a shortbow. 
Also in this room, against the wall, are 40 arrows, 40 crossbow bolts, two light crossbows, two spears, and a longsword

Explosive Alcohol. A character who is proficient with brewer’s supplies or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows House Caford makes a high proof apple brand known as Old Caford Thunder with explosive potential. If the barrel or its contents take fire damage, the barrel explodes and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Treasure. There are 27 cp on the ground, along with a dice set carved from bright green teeth that glow in the dark (worth 3 gp), and a ring with a weathered pearl that glows faintly blue (sentinel ring - Gadin will recognize it - goblins are fascinated by it because they like glowing things, and of course it always glows around them).

## S3: Wardrobe

Once a storeroom, this is now where prisoners are "dressed" before they are brought to the petrification ritual. Various armor and clothing in multiple sizes are scattered about here. Players will recognize their various armor here, in addition to whatever else they might want to scavenge. Unless they make a ton of noise, the goblins in **S2** won't here them.

Find here:
- Two suits of leather armor
- Two suits of studded leather armor
- Two chain shirts
- Eight sets of clothes, in various degrees of finery and repair. One of these is a set of  *Clothes of Mending*, which look very archaic, some kind of out-of-style elegant dress. 
- A collection of pouches, backpacks, saddlebags, and other scattered containers. Among the junk are three component pouches. 
# Barracks

The barracks are now used as the living quarters of the goblins. The roof has also been repaired, and there is evidence of recent patchwork. 

Like the smithy, sounds inside this building won't carry far. 

## **B0: Doorway**

Two **goblin warriors** stand guard outside, somewhat haphazardly. They will be slow to react to combat and are fairly easy to surprise. At the beginning of round 3, if they are still alive, will attempt to flee and raise the alarm. 
## **B1: Entry**

Plain entry hall. Can here skittering sounds from B4 and training goblin sounds from B2. Probably other clues - muddy tracks (goblins coming and going), etc. 
## **B2: Hall**

This is was once the main hall of the barracks, serving as a dining room, sleeping quarters, and a training/sparring space. Currently, the table is pushed out of the way, and goblins are sparring. 

Forcan (a goblin cursespitter) and Ulgna (a goblin spinecleaver) train a group of ten goblin lackeys. When they notice the party, Ulgna uses her Greataxe to attack. Forcan hurls hexes. Forcan attempts to run to area **B4** to stir up the skitterings, if possible. Forcan carries Loria's scroll. 

While Forcan is a true believer, Ulgna despises Grimestone and will flee with into the barracks and down the tunnels if she is seriously threatened, along with half the surviving lackeys. 

## **B3: Barracks**

This room is where the goblins mostly sleep. At night, most of the goblins are sleeping here (some sleep in the tunnels). Otherwise, this room is empty of people. 

The red square is a concealed entrance to the tunnels below, requiring DC 12 check to notice.

Various scattered bits of goblin treasure are here, including lots of rations and other foodstuff (mostly stolen), a large number of bedrolls, and some coins: 90 cp, 23 sp, 8 gp. One goblin has hidden Loria's ring of birdcalls under his pillow. 
## **B4: Skittering Den**

This room has the following features:

- (If the skitterlings have already been stirred up to attack the characters, they aren’t in this room.) “Scores of winged rodents with six legs cling to the dirt ceiling, chittering to each other.”
    
- “Foul-smelling guano covers the floor.”

Skitterlings. A swarm of skitterlings clings to the ceiling here, eager for violence. A Jagged Edge bandit who enters this room can use their action to stir up the skitterlings, who then fly through the complex in search of intruders.
    
Each character who enters the area while the skitterlings are at rest must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid disturbing them. Alternatively, a character can befriend the swarm by succeeding on a DC 11 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, made with advantage if the character offers food. A befriended swarm does not attack any of the characters.
    
Guano. When a creature who isn’t a Jagged Edge bandit or skitterling starts their turn in this area, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn.

# Tunnels
Many parts of the tunnels were originally constructed by the pirates as an escape route, and have since been modified by the goblins. 
## T1: Entrance
Main entrance under barracks. There is a concealed pit trap at the pinch point of the exit.

## T2: Sleeping Space
An extra sleeping space the goblins sometimes use. Can find trash, mostly.

## T3: Twist
The corridor twists and narrows here, with another pit trap. 

## T4: Escape
This is the escape route to the hills, with a concealed pit to enter it.

## T5: Long Tunnel
This was originally built by the pirates as an escape route, and has not been changed by goblins. Different construction. 

## T6: Garden Entrance
A concealed exit/entrance to the tunnels in the kitchen gardens. This was originally constructed by the pirates, and has not been found by the goblins. Requires a DC 15 Perception or Investigation check to find among the weeds. There once was a ladder here, but not anymore. It is a 20 foot drop to the bottom. 

The pirates had a tripwire trap on the way from the entrance to the wine cellar door. Requires a DC 17 Perception or Investigation to notice, otherwise triggers. 

This was a poison arrow trap, but the poison is no longer effective. Each character makes a DC 12 Dex saving throw, taking 1d6 damage on a fail, 2d6 if fail by 5 or more, and nothing on a success. 

## T7: Kitchen Entrance
This is an obvious trap door in the floor of the former pantry. It is locked with a rusted iron padlock. Requires a DC 13 lockpicking check to open. 

## T8: Wine Cellar

All the wine here has long since turned to vinegar, and most of the barrels are rotted through and decayed. 

On the north end, there is an area that was dug out by the bandits, and still has some hidden treasure:
- 12 bolts Tollender red cloth, rotted and worthless
- A pouch of 20 gp, 300 sp; the pouch is decayed
- A necklace with a fine pearl hanging on a silver thread. The pearl looks extremely valuable (worth 100 gp)
- Four pieces of copper jewelry, weathered
- A leather document case with a faded map indicating pirate coves and Tollender navy patrol routes
- Now rotten furs
- A silver locket with a faded painting of a young woman, and the inscription, "To J. M., with love, P. " a folded slip of paper inside might once have read: "Keep safe and come back to me!"

Connects to area H4 in the manor. 

**Guards:**
- Two hobgoblin troopers
- One hobgoblin incendiarist
- One grilp

When combat begins, the grilp will attempt to flee up the stairs to warn the manor, while the troopers and incendiarist will fight for a round, and then retreat up the stairs to benefit from reinforcements. 
# Stables

All that is left of the stables is a low stone wall hinting at the former shape. Even a careful search does not turn up anything here, except evidence the goblins frequently use this as a bathroom. 

# Kitchen Gardens

Once the gardens of the manor, provided food, herbs, etc. Now wildly overgrown.

Anyone with herbalism kit proficiency or alchemists's kit proficiency can find ingredients here to make something (potion, poison, antitoxin, etc).

# Kitchen Buildings

There was once a freestanding bread oven, a pantry/kitchen, and a granary. Now all the buildings are destroyed, with no roofs and partial walls (usually 4-6 feet high). The brick oven for baking bread is still more or less intact and recognizable. 

An overgrown trapdoor is the pantry that leads to the wine cellar has rotted (DC 12 to find). Anyone standing on it must make a DC 13 Dex saving throw or fall 10 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d6 piercing damage as they crash into a stack of wine bottles which shatter on impact, into the wine cellar. 

Roll tension dice on impact. 

# Formal Gardens

A classic Italianate formal garden, but mostly unrecognizable due to lack of maintenance. Wild and overgrown. There is a central fountain, which still has fresh water, seemingly an endless supply (magical). The medusa is turned to stone looking over the fountain - no one has dared smash her, but her head has fallen off and is lying on the ground nearby under a hedgerow (DC 15 check depending on how one searches).

Every other statue in the gardens - there are a lot - has had the head destroyed by the pirates, who were creeped out by how lifelike the expressions looked. 

Tons of places to hide here given how overgrown everything is. Would require a good survival roll to hide a camp completely, especially if the base is on alert, but when not alerted this is fairly simple. 

A pair of small stoneback isopods make these gardens their home. They generally hide in one of the small streams, and attack only if a single medium creature passes by, or a pair of small creatures. Requires DC 15 Perception to notice them. They are small, instead of large, and have 28 hit points, and work together to grapple creatures (only grappled if both hit with a seize attack - otherwise use the statblock as is).
# Entry Gardens

These were once the formal entry to the manor, showcasing the marble facade and steps leading to the grand doorway. Now, however, they are overgrown and weedy, with several trees growing out of place, and the retaining wall around the kitchen garden intact but cracking. 

The hobgoblins watching the gate keep an eye on the entry gardens as well. If anyone is spotted, will shoot arrows, and then one will run to sound the alarm. 

Combat longer than 3 rounds here is audible in the manor. 
# Chapel

The Perdoli family was important in the winemakers guild of Vistabla, and built a private chapel dedicated to the Mother, the patron deity of the winemakers guild. During the medusa era, this was a common place for her to rage. 

The walls are ruined, and the roof is totally gone, so this is open to the air, with grass growing over the ground. 

There are a considerable number of weathered statues, mostly broken, here - the remains of the medusa's work. This freaks out the goblins, who don't patrol here. 

There is a hidden trapdoor that leads to a crypt, which is a safe place to rest, intact, and contains as well some treasure:
- 4 silver candlesticks
- two potions of healing
- one scroll of cure wounds
- one potion of watchful rest
- a holy icon of the mother
- a large silver plate
- a rotted chest with 800 silver coins and 1600 copper coins, from pre-War Cymea by the look

The trapdoor is marked by a square of flowers that grow in its shape. Noticing the flowers requires only a DC 8 Perception check, but deciphering it requires at at least a 15. 
# Manor

## Main Area

Generally, the right half of the building - the foyer, the parlor, the great hall, is all open and exposed, with a cracked roof and damaged walls. The left half of the building and the rear of the building are intact. 

The courtyard has the basilisk, chained to the floor. The entrance to Grimstone's main lair is the back three rooms. The hobgoblin guards have set up their watch post and quarters in the main foyer and especially the former gallery. 

There are also guards in the wine cellar, who are generally bored. No one is allowed in the back area, and everyone is scared of the basilisk. 

*Several of the hobgoblins carry basilisk salve that can un-petrify a creature*

Can use, if needed for a quick combat or to slow things down:
- **Stoneback isopod**
- **Stirges**
### H1: Entrance Stairs

Grand entryway; lots of statues. Perdoli crest. 

(The Perdoli Manor (*Pehr-DOH-lee*) was build in 1479, by the wealthy Perdoli family, merchants and traders. Got rich off wine and control over a marble quarry in the hills, built manor as a place to relax and get away, about a day's journey into the hills from Vistalba.)
### H2: Main Foyer

Hobgoblin guard post. 
- Five hobgoblin recruits
- Three hobgoblin troopers
- One hobgoblin incendiarist
- One grilp

In combat, will try to get reinforcements from wine cellar and the gate guards, but will hold their position, since there is no where to retreat to and defeat would be the ultimate dishonor, worse than death. 

Scared of the basilisk.
### H3: Parlor

Once a beautiful sitting room, now with a cracked roof, exposed to the elements. Can enter the manor through the roof here. 

One grilp is on guard here watching for intruders. Will attempt to alert the main guards in H2. Can be surprised. 
### H4: Servant's Passage

The stairs from the wine cellar emerge here, otherwise empty. 
### H5: Great Hall

This was once the great hall of the villa, where guests were entertained. Little of its former glory remains. A great crack in the wall lets in the elements, and without the fire the stone is cold. There are signs of a fire.  This was occupied by the pirates, and there are signs of occupation, but very old. 

Now, this is decorated with statues. Many statues. Surprisingly lifelike statues. Maybe 10 or so. Some have had pieces knocked off. 
### H6: Sitting Room

The ceiling of this room is completed destroyed. Both doors are barred from the inside, and have been recently repaired. 

The secret door to H8 is rotating bookcase, that still works. The books are gone and one of the shelves is rotted, but it should look incongruous in an otherwise totally ruined room. 

DC 19 to find trigger, DC 12 if they specifically search the bookcase for triggers. 
### H7: Courtyard

Basilisk is here, chained. 
### H8: Private Study

The was once the Perdoli patriach's private study, and was later used by the medusa as a lair. Intact, but all mirrors smashed, all glass and everything else destroyed, and four perfect statues arranged here. Look old, though. 

Grimstone comes in here occasionally to admire. Bandits hated this place and stayed away. 

Lots of shattered glass here. Can find:
- the remains of a silver hand mirror; silver alone worth 5 gp, double that if repaired; there is a setting for a gem of some kind that is empty
- the gem rolled under the desk when the mirror was smashed, it is a 100 gp Garnet (transparent red, brown-green, or violet)
### H9: Private Sitting Room

Empty
### H10: Private Bedchamber

Bedchamber of Perdoli patriach, later used by pirate captain, whose ghost now moans for his lost love.  Grimstone keeps the ghost around as a guard. 

Room still decorated. Trap door under the rug. Perception/investigation can reveal the rug has been moved frequently. Ghost can also tell them. 

Can also find a beautifully illustrated book of love poems by famous Cymean poet from 40 years ago (worth 20 gp)

- **Specter** (cursed ghost of pirate captain, moaning for his lost love, will attack but can be calmed if given the locket)
### H11: Hall

Empty
### H12: Hall

More guards here:
- One hobgoblin incendiarist
- Five goblin recruits

The entrance door here is intact, and barred. 
### H13: Archives

Now a stirge lair. Can also find some history here. 
### H14: Library

Books have been burned, in ruins. But some treasure escaped:
- a pair of rapiers, once mounted on the wall, elegant and well-made, probably once hung on the wall, have fallen behind a bookcase (20 gp each, or can be used)
- a glass case that maybe once held illuminated manuscripts has been knocked over, and is laying face down; one book survives underneath, an illustrated prayer manual of the Mother (worth 25 gp)
### H15: Secret Library

The private archives of the Perdoli family. Never found, super dusty. 
DC 18 check to find. Improvise. Safe place to rest. 
### H16: Gallery

Ruined, probably nothing here?
