don't have complete recording, so for posterity:

- after short rest, fight hobgoblins in the library, then explore. hear hobgoblin recruits, but aren't discovered. hear stirges, but aren't discovered. 
- see basilisk tail, hear chains. gadin makes an attempt at seeing what it is, is almost petrified.

next session:
- pirate lair in basement / wine cellar, need to reconfigure exactly what it is

should basically be a 5 room dungeon, with at least one safe place to short rest, a puzzle/trap, some mystery reveals, and a boss fight. maybe try to find a way to have a role-playing scene too? some history reveal? pertoli family -> cursed medusa -> pirates -> grimstone, where grimstone came because he loved the idea of occupying a medusa palace
