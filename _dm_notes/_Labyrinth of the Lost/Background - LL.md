Some rough details for local features:

**Vistalba** (Veess-tahl-bah) - the largest town in this area, a trading port with a decent harbor, once much richer; now has a kind of run-down, lost in the past feeling. harbor dates to Drankorian days, though. once a major port through with Cymea wine, silver, and other goods passed. 

**Castelluccio** (Cah-steh-loo-cho) - one of several small villages inland along the Serrania, scraping by on agriculture

**Vallegra** (Vah-yeh-grah) - another agricultural village

**Redes** (Reh-des) - a small fishing village on the coast, just south of Lunacosta

**Lunacosta** (Loo-nah-koh-stah) - a market town on the coast at the mouth of the Serrania River

==

**Plataca Hills** (*PLAH-tah-kah*) - the hills that begin as low foothills about 40 miles from the western gulf, and rise to a significant barrier to travel

**Serran√≠a River** *(Seh-rrah-nee-ah)* - the rushing, rocky river that flows from the Plataca Hills to the Western Gulf. Only the first 10 miles or so are easily navigable.
