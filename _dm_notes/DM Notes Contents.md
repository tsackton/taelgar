The shared DM notes folder is designed to make worldbuilding easier by sharing DM Notes from campaigns where possible. 

This includes both canonical and non-canon games, to the extent non-canon games might have material worth mining. 

This also including some old brainstorming and DM notes that are not sufficiently close to canon to be worth sorting through and putting into Worldbuilding, but are kept for historical interest or to mine for ideas. 

## Campaign DM Notes

Campaigns are in directories starting with `_` so they will sort to the top. These include:

**Canonical** and **Ongoing**:

`_Addermarch`: Tim's Addermarch game, set in DR 1715 in Addermarch. Players: Kate, Isaac, Nathaniel

`_Cleenseau`: Mike's Cleenseau game, set in DR 1720 in southern Sembara. Players: Dan, Kiya, Matt, Chris

`_Great Library`: Tim's Great Library campaign, set in DR 1747 in Voltara but ranging beyond. Players: Isaac, Sasha, Mi'sol and various other friends of Isaac's at different times. 

**Canonical** and **Finished**:

`_Labyrinth of the Lost:` Tim's western Cymea mini-game (3 session). Set in western Cymea in DR ~1740s. Players: Phil, Sara, John, and one of Sara's friends. 

`_Riswynn and Oskar:` Tim's western Cymea mini-game (3 session). Set in western Cymea in DR ~1740s. Players: Phil, Sara, John, and one of Sara's friends. 

**Semi-Canonical** and **Finished**:

(something like the events happened, but details are blurry)

`_Stone Titan Attacks`: (Tim, starter adventure for Dunmar Campaign)
`_Ausson's Crossing`: (Mike, starter adventure for Cleenseau Campaign)

**Non-Canonical** and **Finished**

`_Plaguelands`: (Tim, original family game; semi-rebooted in Addermarch campaign)
`_Whitesparrow Trouble`: (Tim, run during COVID for work group; not canonical)

**Strays**

`Tollen One Shot - The Haunted Clocktower`: Tim, non-canon one shot ran in mid-2022 for John Leeker, Eric, and Schwartz (I think), some time when no one else was free. Inspired some development of Tollen but details should not be considered canon. Kept for historical interest. 

## Other Directories

`Old Mechanics`: Contains a bunch of old notes on mechanics/homebrew, that Tim worked on from 2019 - 2022, roughly. These notes are mostly kept for posterity/curiousity.
