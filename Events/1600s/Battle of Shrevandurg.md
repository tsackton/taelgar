# The Battle of Shrevandurg

A mysterious event in Dunmari history, remembered as a great victory in the long defense of the [[Shrev]] frontier.

What is preserved in surviving records is fragmentary: a name, a place, and later claims of divine intervention. Scholars of [[Dunmar]] sometimes cite the battle alongside other half‑documented victories—events invoked to legitimize rulers and priesthoods, rather than described in full narrative detail.
