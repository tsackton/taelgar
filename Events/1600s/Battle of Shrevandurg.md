# The Battle of Shrevandurg
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

A poorly documented battle on the [[Shrev]] frontier in [[Western Dunmar]], studied by [[Govir]] as an example of divine power aiding the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] in battle. 

%%

Old notes (not canon) describe this as a Dunmari victory against an incursion of spore zombies attacking across the Shrev from the southern jungles, but the main point is it is a mysterious battle along the Shrev somewhere.
