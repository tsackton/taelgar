### The Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon

The events surrounding the first time the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] was driven from Tokra. Commander Ila, the local garrison commander responsible for the defense of Tokra in the aftermath of the [[Second Hobgoblin War]], seems to have driven the werewolves away during the 1620s in Drankorian Reckoning, in the 67th-69th years of the Nayan Dynasty.

It was during this time that the [[Dunmari map of Pandemonium ruins]] was created.
