The Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon was a campaign waged over the course of four months in the summer of the 68th year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1625). 

The [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], a werewolf cult dedicated to the advancement of the [[Mad One]], was driven from [[Tokra]] during the course of this campaign, waged by the Dunmari under Commander [[Ila]], the local garrison commander responsible for the defense of [[Tokra]] at the time. 

The werewolves had established a base in abandoned ruins north of the city, build over an [[Extraplanar Weak Point]] connected to [[Pandemonium]]. The energy leaking from the plane of madness prevented easy approach for the warriors under Commander [[Ila]], until a [[Dunmari map of Pandemonium ruins|map]] was created that documented a magical route allowing approach of the ruins. 

The last werewolves in [[Tokra]] were executed in August of the 68th year of the Nayan Dynasty, but a significant fraction of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] was able to escape east.
