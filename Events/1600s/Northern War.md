A brutal war fought in the north of [[Dunmar]] against the [[Blackened Claw]] hobgoblin clan. Ended is a complete and total Dunmari victory, with the hobgoblins crushed. 

It was during this war that the old fortress of [[Raven's Hold]] was occupied by hobgoblin troops, who used it as a base of operations to raid against Dunmari to the south and west. 

%% some additional color in old Raven's Hold DM notes in OneNote, but nothing that changes the overall historical picture. %%
