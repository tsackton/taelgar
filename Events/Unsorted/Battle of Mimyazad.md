# Battle of Mimyazad

A large battle fought in 1704, between Uzgash's orcs and the Yuvanti dwarves on one side, and the rebel orcs on the other.

Was the final battle in the series of dwarf-orc skirmishes in the early 1700s. As Uzgash consolidated territory to the east, various remnant bands that remained loyal to Thark struck west, coming into conflict primarily with the dwarves. Uzgash sent a mission to Yuvanti to propose an alliance to destroy these orcs in a single massive battle. Many dwarves initially argued against this, wary of trusting orcs, but eventually the side of diplomacy won (although a contingency plan was drawn up to ambush Uzgash in the aftermath if needed).

The battle was a great victory. The dwarves kept falling back, luring the enemy orcs deeper and deeper into dwarven territory, until outside the fort of Mimyazad they made a stand, funneling the much larger force of orcs into a tight position. Unbeknownst to the orcs, Uzgash's horde was waiting on the right flank on high ground, and when a dwarven feint lured the attacking orcs to charge the hill, thinking they had broken the dwarven lines, they were met with the vicious counterattack from Uzgash.

This also became known as the Battle of the Rising Sun, so named for the emblems of a rising sun that Uzgash's horde wore to distinguish themselves from the other orcs, and also because the fighting continued through the night with the final defeat of the enemy orcs only happening as dawn broke.
