The Drankorian Western Wars were a series of campaigns by the [[Drankorian Empire]] between DR 597 and DR 634, fought to subjugate the peoples of the [[Yeraad Watershed]], the western [[Coastlands]], and the [[Chasa River Valley]]. The end of these wars established [[Lake Valandros]] as the furthest extent of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorian]] control in the west.
