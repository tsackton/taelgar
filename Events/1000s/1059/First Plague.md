# The First Plague
>[!info]+ Event Summary
>`$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The First Plague is the catastrophic outbreak that struck the heartland of the [[Drankorian Empire]] in DR 1059. The plague shattered imperial governance and precipitated the [[Fall of Drankor]], leaving the imperial provinces to fragment into successor realms.

Later histories describe a secondary legacy alongside political collapse: the ruins of Drankor and its heartland became places of curse and fear, and long-distance routes—especially by sea—became more perilous in the generations that followed.

## DM notes

- Consider adding alternative historical names for the plague if/when they are introduced elsewhere in the vault (e.g., “Great Plague” or region-specific names).
- Several notes contain campaign-facing theories about political causes and conspiracies around the Fall; keep those theories out of the player-facing summary unless corroborated as in-world scholarship.
