# The First Plague
>[!info]+ Event Summary
>`$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The First Plague is the catastrophic wave of magical destruction that spread from [[Drankor]], striking the heartland of the [[Drankorian Empire]] in DR 1059. The curse, caused by [[Cha'mutte]], killed nearly the entire population of [[Drankor]], spread death and famine through the hinterlands of the city, contaminated much of the [[Kharja]], [[Hara]], and lower [[Istaros]] river basins.

The name is wrong and needs to be fixed. 

The basic vibe of the two "plagues":

(1) The so-called "First Plague" (which needs a new name) is fundamentally not a plague in any real sense. It is a wave of magical destruction that spreads from Cha'mutte, more like a super-overpowered breath weapon than anything else (though still flavored as red mist). There is possibly some magical way this spreads via the Crown, too, so people start dropping dead who were tied to the crown. But the real collapse of the Drankorian Empire comes from the consequences of Apollyon's centralization of administrative control in his person via the Crown and Scepter. (though, the heartlands of the Empire need to be cursed for the Dunmari to cure, and the cursed/haunted lands around Drankor are established at this time)

(2) [[Cha'mutte's Plague]] is more like a plague. It is a mist that blows with the winds, and lingers, but doesn't immediately kill people who encounter it. Rather, they get usually get sick, and die of a wasting disease / cough. It is not clear if it can spread from person-to-person or just from mist-to-person, but it clear that not everyone who encounters the mist gets sick, and probably not everyone who gets sick dies. In many ways this is supposed to be a weaker echo of the Drankorian events.
