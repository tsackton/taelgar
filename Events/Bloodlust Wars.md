%% @Mike: setting status/check on all Sembaran history events %%

The Bloodlust Wars were a series of hobgoblin raids and campaigns against [[Sembara]] in the years immediately after the [[Great War]], led primarily by the [[Iron Fang]] clan. Though the [[Iron Fang]] advanced at least as far north as [[Valarin]], they did not directly threaten Sembaran strongholds along the [[Enst|Enst River]]. 

%% 
The exact extent of the northward advance - south of Cleenseau, north of Valarin - is not determined.
