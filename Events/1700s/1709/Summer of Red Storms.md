# The Summer of Red Storms
>[!info]+ Information

In the year 1709 DR, the monsoons brought not just rain but rampaging half-human, half-hyena creatures (gnolls), who raided villages as far west as the [[Hara]] river valley for two months before they were stopped. 

Researched by [[Govir]] in the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]].
