### First Spider Attack on Taviose
*October 20th, 1719; 10am*

A giant spider (the size of a horse) and three large spiders (the size of dogs) attacked the hamlet of [[Taviose]] in the mid-morning. 

A large spider crept out of the woods onto the roof of [[Perrin Voclain|Perrin Voclain's]] house and attacked him when he came outside to investigate. The timely intervention of [[Viepuck]], [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]], [[Celyn]], and [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] prevented worse disaster. The three smaller spiders snuck through the fields and tried to ambush the party, but [[Celyn]] spotted two of the three before they could strike. 

[[Viepuck]] was able to badly damage the largest spider with eldritch magic, before being paralyzed by a smaller one. [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] rode down one spider, [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]] destroyed one by calling down the power of the moon on it, and [[Celyn]]-- after vanishing a misty sparkle and reappearing next to [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]] was able to skewer the final one in the eye.

[[Perrin Voclain|Perrin]] was badly injured, but saved by the actions of [[Viepuck]], [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]], and [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]], who magically healed him.
