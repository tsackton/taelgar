# The Tragic Flood of the River Enst
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

After a morning of heavy rain, the [[Enst]] unexpected flooded its banks in several places between [[Cleenseau]] and [[Rinburg]]. The three children of [[Rosalind Essford]] and their nursemaid were swept away. In the aftermath, [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] took the [[Lord's Guard of Cleenseau]] out "hunting", convinced there was an unexplained nefarious agent at work. This left [[Cleenseau]] significantly understaffed when the [[Cleenseau Spider Attacks]] began.

%% Note: This event was important in the backstory of the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]] as it put them in a leadership position. Despite looking, there is in fact no evidence of foul play. %%
