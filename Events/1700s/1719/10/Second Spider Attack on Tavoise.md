### Second Spider Attack on Taviose
*October 21st, 1719; 3am*

In the early pre-dawn morning of October 21st, the spiders attacked [[Taviose]] a second time. 

The party learned of this attack a few hours after it happened, and after discussing the events with the survivors in [[Cleenseau]] and throughouly searching the hamlet (where [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]] was aided by a mysterious sense of making connections between what he was seeing and his memories) the party was able to reconstruct what happened as follows:

In the predawn, five spiders (one large one and four dog-sized ones) crept into the hamlet on webs flung from the eaves of the forest. Each spider swung into a house at about the same time and quickly murdered the inhabitants of the houses they had attacked.

One group of families fled west through the eaves of the [[Cleenseau Wood|Wood]] and made it to Clenseau about two hours after the attack. They were quick to leave, and reported that [[Perrin Voclain|Perrin]] was originally with them, but they waved him back into the village to help the others.

A second group of families was pinned down by the spiders, and only escaped after [[Perrin Voclain|Perrin]] and three other villagers killed the largest spider and one of the smaller ones. This group fled east to [[Valit]] as the remaining three spiders each dragged a body into [[Cleenseau Wood|the Wood]]. 

A trail of blood was seen leaving the village, as was a set of webs, both heading into [[Cleenseau Wood|the Wood]]. 

[[Perrin Voclain|Perrin]] made it safely, but badly injured, to [[Valit]] along with several others. One of the villages who helped kill the spiders died from injuries before reaching [[Valit]]. 

Taking a headcount, the party is able to determine that of the 48 people living in [[Taviose]], 14 have died, 12 made it safely to [[Cleenseau]], and 19, including [[Perrin Voclain|Perrin]], [[Brot Starsearcher]], and [[Diesla Starsearcher]] made it to [[Valit]]. The remaining three are missing and presumed dragged into the forest. At least one of the three was believed to be alive, but paralyzed.
