A war fought between the armies of [[Grash]] and the orcs of [[Xurkhaz]], aided by [[Dunmar Fellowship]], over the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

The war began when [[Grash]] marched east from his bases in Kharsan, aiming to defeat the orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] and in the process steal the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] from [[Lubash]]. After an initial strike force led by [[Kadmos]] failed to recover the cloak, and Grash's undead armies were prevented from entering [[Uzgukhar]] by the powerful magic of [[Riswynn]], Grash besieged the city. The siege was broken, and Grash killed, by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]].
