# The Chardon-Dunmari War

The Chardon‑Dunmari War was a recent war between [[Chardon]] and [[Dunmar]], fought in the late 1740s DR. In the Dunmari Frontier campaign’s records, it is closely tied to the struggle for legitimacy within Dunmar and to Chardon’s military involvement in support of its allies.

The war’s end is marked, in these accounts, by the sudden withdrawal of Chardonian forces after General [[Marius Cusico]] called for an end to hostilities.
