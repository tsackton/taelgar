In DR 1720, a surge of [[Plaguelands]] horrors—ash elementals, ash‑spawn, and corrupted things from the Istaros valley—emerged with the summer ash storms. Striking swiftly across the [[Aursen]] and towards the [[Aurbez Plateau]], they were eventually defeated by a coalition of [[The Rangers]] and Aurbeze militias. This was a formative event that led to the creation of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]].

Some discussion in discord notes, esp [[2025-11-02]] about wider context
While the canonical role of this war in establishing the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] is clear, the wider extend is not documented here and likely involved conflicts elsewhere (e.g. [[Naithale]]), potentially including the [[March of Andonne]] as well, and maybe even southern Addermarch, Orenlas, etc. 
Triggered by the [[Awakened Soul Disaster]], which led to the growth of the titanic limbo ooze killed at the end of the Dunmar campaign.
