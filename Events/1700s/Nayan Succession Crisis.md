# The Nayan Succession Crisis
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The Nayan Succession Crisis was a contested succession within [[Dunmar]] late in the [[Nayan Dynasty]]. It is remembered as a moment when doubts about legitimacy, temple politics, and the fragility of consensus within the Dunmari priesthood became impossible to ignore.

In the most commonly recorded chronology, the crisis followed the death of Samraat Nayan Lina in DR 1728, after a turbulent reign that began in DR 1718.

## Background

In Dunmar, the Samraat is both head of state and head of the temple system. Although the Nayan dynasty held the throne for generations, the legitimacy of any individual ruler depends on recognition by the temples and the widely held belief that the gods have granted the Samraat the right to rule.

Accounts of the period describe growing friction between eastern and western temples, and increasing doubt—especially among eastern clans—that the decisions of the priesthood and the Samraat reflected the will of the gods. This unrest followed other calamities of the era, including the [[Summer of Red Storms]].

## The Crisis

After the death of Samraat Nayan Lina, the temple conclave struggled to reach a settlement that would be accepted across Dunmar. Some accounts hold that the temples’ consensus choice refused to be proclaimed Samraat, claiming they did not feel the gods wished them to rule.

## Resolution

The dispute was resolved only after protracted prayer and debate, when a compromise candidate—Samraat [[Marathu|Nayan Marathu]]—was elevated to the throne.

## Legacy

Later histories treat the succession crisis as a precursor to the deeper legitimacy disputes that followed: the contested proclamation of [[Nayan Karnas]] after Marathu’s death, and the eventual outbreak of the [[Sibling War]] after the return of [[Sura]].

## DM notes

- Conflict to reconcile:
  - [[Dunmar]] places Samraat Nayan Lina’s death (and the succession crisis) in DR 1728 and implies resolution the following year; this note uses `DR: 1728` and `DR_end: 1729` accordingly.
  - [[Session 84 - Dunmar Notes]] and the longer political history embedded in [[Sura]] place the same crisis in DR 1736 (with a similar refusal and compromise accession).
- Additional detail (primarily from DM notes; treat as provisional until reconciled with “public” chronicle notes):
  - The refusal is framed as a legitimacy crisis: the candidate claims they feel no “divine spark”, and that accepting the throne would be sacrilege.
  - The compromise accession is framed as a sharp break with hereditary expectations: an elder is asked to lead as a caretaker while the realm seeks unity.
- The broader context for why such a refusal mattered (how the Samraat is chosen, and how legitimacy is argued between temples) is summarized in DM-facing form in [[Session 84 - Dunmar Notes]].
