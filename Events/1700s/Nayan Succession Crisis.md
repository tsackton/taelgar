The Nayan Succession Crisis was a contested succession during the [[Nayan Dynasty]] of [[Dunmar]]. It exposed growing fractures in the Dunmari temple hierarchy and the fragility of consensus within the Dunmari priesthood. The crisis followed the death of Samraat Nayan Lina in 171 Nayan, after a turbulent reign that began in 161 Nayan. 

## Background

Though [[Dunmar]] had been formally at peace for over a hundred years, the early 1700s were a time of increasing tension between the Nayan rulers in [[Western Dunmar]] and the pastoralists and nomadic herders of the open lands in [[Central Dunmar]] and [[Eastern Dunmar]]. For decades, the ruling dynasty had been focused on the southern borders, on mostly-fruitless attempts to push south across the [[Shrev]]. A series of crises in the east, including the [[Summer of Red Storms]], were largely ignored, and through the turbulent reign of Nayan Lina, doubts began to grow in the eastern temples about the [[Nayan dynasty]]'s divine legitimacy and commitment to the whole of Dunmar. 

## The Crisis

After the death of Samraat Nayan Lina, the temple conclave, dominated by western priests with ties to the [[Nayan Dynasty]], proposed Kalyan of Nayahar, a close cousin of Nayan Lin and widely seen as dynastic choice to ensure the rule of [[Dunmar]] remained with the descendants of Na[[Yarad|yan Y]]arad. Many of the eastern temples revolted, claiming that the [[Nayan dynasty]] had ceased to listen to the [[Five Siblings]]. To the surprise of everyone, Kalyan agreed with his critics. He claimed he could not feel the divine will in his actions, and was sure he was not chosen by the [[Five Siblings]] to be Samraat, and so could not in good conscience take this power. 

After many weeks of prayer and debate, [[Marathu]], an elder from one of the western clans from the high plains between [[Darba]] and [[Tokra]] is asked to lead. Samraat Nayan [[Marathu]] takes over as Samraat in 172 Nayan, at the age of 60, seen as a caretaker to begin the process of building unity across [[Dunmar]].
