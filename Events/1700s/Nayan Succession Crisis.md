A succession crisis triggered when the consensus choice of the western temples refused to be proclaimed Samraat, claiming they did not feel that the gods wished them to rule. 

The crisis was resolved only after protracted prayer and debate, when a compromise candidate—an elder seen by many as a caretaker—was elevated to the throne, reshaping the politics of the [[Nayan Dynasty]] and deepening the divide between eastern and western temple factions.

## DM notes

- Conflict to reconcile:
  - [[Dunmar]] and [[Timeline of the Nayan Dynasty]] place Samraat Nayan Lina’s death (and the succession crisis) at 171 Nayan / DR 1728.
  - DM-facing notes and the biographical note for [[Nayan Sura]] place the same crisis in DR 1736.
- The core story beat is consistent across sources: the western temples’ preferred successor refused the throne, claiming no divine calling, forcing a compromise accession.
