%% have some notes in OneNote that need to be incorporated, also a bit from the backstory of Schwartz's Mawar character, but nothing that alters the basic logic below %%

Grumella's War was a series of battles fought between the orcs of [[Grumella's Horde]], led by [[Grumella]], primarily against the humans of [[Voltara]], aided by the [[Silver Tempests]]. 

The origins of this war came from the growing influence of the orc warlord [[Grumella]] in the northern reaches of the [[Erbalta Plains]], north of the [[Chardonian Empire|Chardonian]] outposts near [[Voltara]]. Over the course of the spring of 1747, Grumella subdued a large number of struggling orc communities who had lived mostly off of meager hunting and minor raids. By late May, Grumella Horde, displaying an unusual degree of organization for an orcish army, was raiding travelers, farmers, and shepherds near [[Voltara]], and extracting tribute.

The war escalated when the [[Silver Tempests]] killed one of [[Grumella]]'s lieutenants, and eventually erupted into a full-fledged attack when the people of [[Voltara]] refused to turn over the [[Silver Tempests]] for punishment. 

[[Grumella]] was finally defeated at the [[The Battle of Voltara]], which also cemented the fame of the [[Silver Tempests]] in the area. The final disorganized remnants of [[Grumella's Horde]] were defeated over the course of November 1747, in a series of raids led by the [[Chardonian Legion]] from forts along the northern border.
