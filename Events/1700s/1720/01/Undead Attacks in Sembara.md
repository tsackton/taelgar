# The Undead Attacks in Sembara
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

In the first two months of 1720, the dead rose across southern Sembara, especially [[Wisford]], [[Dunfry]], and [[Ainwick]]. They rose in clusters and sporadically. Some places were barely harmed, other places had hundreds of zombies descend upon them. 

These attacks were devastating, and in many places entire villages were destroyed. The dead rose in two waves - the first wave over the nights of January 5th, 6th, and 7th. The second, much smaller wave, arose during the new moon, of February 3rd, 4th, and 5th.

%% Some notes from my DM notes, copied/moved here. These are canonical, if incomplete:

First wave:
* Jan 4th overnight - dead awaken across Sembara, mostly in places where there are large numbers of unburied dead
* Jan 5th overnight - second wave of dead awaken
* Jan 6th overnight - third wave of dead awaken

These arise in a set of major clusters:
* Fellburn skeletal army, emerges Jan 6th - 7th overnight, crawls and forms and reforms, some people flee and die Battle of Stavenford / Battle of Fellburn, (largest mass of undead)
* Rinburg 6th - 7th emerges in lake (giant eel thing only, minimal actual undead)
* Aveil hills, emerges 4th - 5th (small)
* Ainwick emerges 5th - 6th bandit zombies (big)
* Cleenseau 4th - 5th second one 7th (small)
* Dunmore 4th - 5th (small)
* Enford 6th - 7th (small)
* Gowerborne Wis 2 - 5th - 6th, (big)

There could have been one in Eskbridge, my notes are unclear and I have avoided defining truth in game

Second clusters arise Feb 3 / 4 / 5 but all very small (10 or less). Clearly much weaker.

Each night of the new moon is like a cresting wave, in some places, it builds and hits more, but comes later, in other places, doesn't build as much. So basically you get somewhat random things, scattered across the 3 days.

Quite after Jan 15th or so (but see siege of fellburn), although widespread devastion - perhaps 10% of population dead, in Wisford, border region, Aveil. Worst in Wisford.
