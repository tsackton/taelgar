The Battle of Voltara (also called the Battle of Lightning’s Wrath) was the climactic battle of [[Grumella's War]]. The defenders of [[Voltara]]—aided by the adventuring company known as the [[Silver Tempests]] and their allies—broke [[Grumella]]’s siege and [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 2|slew the orc warlord]].

The battle is remembered in local chronicles for the storm and lightning that accompanied the fighting, and for the sudden collapse of the horde’s cohesion after Grumella’s death.
