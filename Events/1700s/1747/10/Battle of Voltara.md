# The Battle of Voltara

The Battle of Voltara (also called the Battle of Lightning’s Wrath) was the climactic battle of [[Grumella's War]]. On DR 1747‑10‑06, the defenders of [[Voltara]]—aided by the adventuring company known as the [[Silver Tempests]] and their allies—broke [[Grumella]]’s siege and slew the orc warlord.

The battle is remembered in local chronicles for the storm and lightning that accompanied the fighting, and for the sudden collapse of the horde’s cohesion after Grumella’s death.
