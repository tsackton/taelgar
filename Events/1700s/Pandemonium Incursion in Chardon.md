Early in the morning on May 1st, 1749, a shimmering gray wall of a strange fog appears in the Kylos Market, a major market on the [[South Bank]]. Those closest to the fog -- anyone who came in contact with the mists -- were blown away, never to be seen again, their fate unknown. Those who escaped reported hearing a terrifying howling wind. For the next few days, strange winds would blow across the city at night, and more than a few people awoke with a madness in their eyes, their minds destroyed by the winds. 

By the middle of May, the winds were contained, and the strange gray mist wall was identified as a [[Pandemonium]] [[Elemental Vortex|vortex]], though the vortex was not fully closed for several weeks after. 

The [[Kylos Market]], though, is never the same and is quietly abandoned.
