# The Awakened Soul Disaster

In the year DR 1718, the monks of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], with the aid of [[Rai]], attempted to remove the extraplanar corruption from the Plaguelands. This effort failed, and as a consequence Rai's power was diminished and the monks were scattered, perhaps to other planes or distant parts of the material plane.
