In the spring and summer of DR 1748, gnoll warbands swept across [[Eastern Dunmar]], attacking villages and pastoralist camps, and driving waves of refugees westward towards [[Tokra]]. The raids struck hardest around [[Karawa]] and [[Bas Udda]], both of which suffered heavy damage, and took advantage of the disruption in [[Shakun's Protection]] caused by the meddling of [[Agata|Agata Dustmother]].
