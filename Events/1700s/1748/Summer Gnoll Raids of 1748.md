# Summer Gnoll Raids

In the spring and summer of DR 1748, gnoll warbands swept across [[Eastern Dunmar]], attacking villages and caravans and driving waves of refugees westward. The raids struck hardest along the fringe of the [[Nashtkar]] and the lands around [[Karawa]] and [[Bas Udda]].

The raids weakened the border cults that defended Dunmar’s eastern marches; in particular, the [[Shakun Mystai]] suffered heavy losses, and communities across the east were left shaken for months afterward.
