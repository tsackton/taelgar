# Destruction of the Werewolf Cult

On DR 1748‑07‑03, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] destroyed a werewolf cult operating in and around [[Tokra]]. The cult was tied to the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] and to a Drankorian ruin near a weak point to [[Pandemonium]].

Described in [[Session 38 (DuFr)]] and [[Session 39 (DuFr)]].

## DM notes

- The session notes attribute the cult’s infiltration of Tokra to the refugee crisis caused by the [[Summer Gnoll Raids of 1748]], and connect the cult’s leadership to dealings with [[Agata]] and the [[Scepter of Command]].
