# The Drankorian Western Wars

The Drankorian Western Wars were a series of campaigns by the [[Drankorian Empire]] between DR 597 and DR 634, fought to subjugate the peoples of the [[Yeraad Watershed]] and the western [[Coastlands]]. Later Chardonian histories portray these wars as the moment when imperial authority—and imperial roads, forts, and institutions—first took root on the west coast.

Chardonian scholars traditionally date the founding of [[Chardon]] to a Drankorian fortress built during these wars.
