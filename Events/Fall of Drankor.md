# The Fall of Drankor

The Fall of Drankor is the conventional name for the collapse of the [[Drankorian Empire]] in DR 1059, when the [[First Plague]] devastated the imperial heartland. In the generations that followed, the empire’s provinces fractured into independent realms, while refugees and surviving institutions reshaped the politics and culture of the western coast and the [[Green Sea]].

Generally speaking, the full consequences and series of events here is not worked out but likely doesn't matter in many contexts. 

Important backstory is at this point Apollyon had been exerting extremely widespread magical mind control via the [[Crown of Purity]] and the [[Scepter of Command]] to crush dissent across vast distances. 

When Apollyon is imprisoned and his attunement to the crown and the scepter shattered, the administrative infrastructure of the Empire collapses essentially overnight. This would probably cause widespread famine and civil unrest.
