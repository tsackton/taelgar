# The Fall of Drankor

The Fall of Drankor is the conventional name for the collapse of the [[Drankorian Empire]] in DR 1059, when the [[First Plague]] devastated the imperial heartland. In the generations that followed, the empire’s provinces fractured into independent realms, while refugees and surviving institutions reshaped the politics and culture of the western coast and the [[Green Sea]].

Later chronicles also connect the Fall with lasting changes to the Drankorian heartland: cursed ruins, broken trade routes, and seas made more dangerous by storm.

## DM notes

- [[Drankorian Empire]] notes several consequences attributed to the Fall (e.g., a cursed region around the mouth of the Drankor river, intensified storms in the [[Sea of Storms]], and environmental shifts that contributed to desertification along the desert’s northern edge).
- The same note contains campaign-facing material proposing deeper political causes for the plague and collapse; treat those as setting-internal theories unless corroborated elsewhere.
