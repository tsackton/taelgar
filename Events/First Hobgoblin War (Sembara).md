# The First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)

The First Hobgoblin War was the first major clash between [[Sembara]] and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] after the [[Blood Years]]. Later Sembaran tradition places the fighting in the upper [[Enst]] valley and remembers it as the beginning of a long pattern: dangers from the west, wars along the marches, and the slow hardening of Sembara’s frontier institutions.

## DM notes

This is the first attempt by the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] to establish a homeland or realm in the upper Enst valley. 

Not a lot has been canonically invented about this war, except:
* Dates are approximately 1574 - 1578; these don't need to be precise, but it needs to have ended a year or two before [[Wisym I]] so that the events related to [[Elaine I]] and [[Anne]] are not taking place during a war
* It likely involved mindflayers as allies or leaders of the hobgoblins
* It may have been the setting for the Stone titan one-shot
* Sembara largely was successful at pushing back the hobgoblins, but it established a strong idea in imagination that "dangers come from the west" and the rise of the [[Army of the West]] to preeminence should date from this period
