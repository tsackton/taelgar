# Derik I's Arrival in Tyrwingha

In DR 1425, during the wars against the [[Dominion of Avatus]], Derik I, then a little-known noble of [[Telham]], arrived in [[Tyrwingha]]. Most tales of the day describe the morning fog parting in golden light at his feet, and [[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]] herself appearing to bless him before the people. 

This marked the beginning of Derik I's rise as a royal figure, eventually leading to the foundation of modern Sembara at the [[Treaty of Wisford]] and the personal union of thrones of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]] under the [[House of Sewick]].
