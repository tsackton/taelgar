# Derik I's Arrival in Tyrwingha

Derik I’s arrival in [[Tyrwingha]] is remembered in Sembara as the moment when a little‑known noble of the north first stepped into the southern realm’s crisis and emerged as its champion. The most popular accounts are preserved in folktales and in storyteller’s guides, which describe fog parting at his feet and [[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]] appearing to bless him before the people.

Whatever the embellishments of the tale, Derik’s arrival marked the beginning of his rise as a royal figure in Tyrwingha, and it foreshadowed the later political settlement associated with the [[Treaty of Wisford]].
