# The Treaty of Valarin
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

A treaty between the [[Istabor Alliance]] and [[Sembara]] establishing boundaries.

%% This does not have to be canonical, esp if say Istabor is rethought as something less "alliance-like"; there needs to be a reason why Sembara didn't expand further southward, but "well-established other people" could be the reason without a specific treaty %%
