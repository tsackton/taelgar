# The Downfall Wars

The Downfall Wars are the name given to the cataclysmic wars that culminated in [[The Downfall]]—the fall of [[Hkar]] and the shattering of much of the old world. Human and elven chronicles describe these wars as an age of extraplanar invasion and desperate alliances, when the servants of the [[Three Despairs]] burst into the world and war touched nearly every land. In modern scholarship, the Downfall Wars are remembered less for any coherent sequence of campaigns and more for their consequences: the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world in its aftermath.
