# The Downfall Wars

The Downfall Wars are the name given to the cataclysmic wars that ended the Third Age and culminated in [[The Downfall]]—the fall of [[Hkar]] and the shattering of much of the old world. Human and elven chronicles describe these wars as an age of extraplanar invasion and desperate alliances, when the servants of the Three Despairs burst into the world and war touched nearly every land.

In modern scholarship, the Downfall Wars are remembered less for any coherent sequence of campaigns and more for their consequences: the drowning of kingdoms, the rise and fall of mountains and seas, and the long dimming of the elder civilizations that preceded the age of humans.

%% AI note: Multiple Gazetteer and history notes explicitly treat the detailed course of the Downfall Wars as intentionally blank/undeveloped; this page summarizes only what is broadly stated elsewhere. %%

## DM notes

- Several notes call out the Downfall Wars as a deliberate “blank space” for a potential future campaign; be cautious about over-specifying dates, factions, or outcomes beyond what is already written elsewhere.
