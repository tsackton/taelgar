# The Second Hobgoblin War (Sembara)

The Second Hobgoblin War was a major war between [[Sembara]] and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] in the late 16th century DR, fought largely in the borderlands south of the [[Enst]] and along the western approaches to [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]]. Later summaries emphasize both the cost of the war and its unresolved ending: the Shattered Ice hobgoblins remained entrenched on the frontier, and the borderlands suffered decades of raid and repression under occupation.

%% AI note: The broad outline and end‑state (hobgoblin occupation of parts of the borderlands) is reflected in multiple Gazetteer notes, but many specifics of the war’s chronology and treaties currently come from timeline/framework material that should be reviewed. %%

## DM notes

- Some timelines place the start of the war around DR 1590 and its end in DR 1602, via a treaty known as the “Treaty of Châteauclair”; no dedicated treaty note currently exists in the vault.
