The Battle of Urlich Pass was the climactic battle of the [[Great War]] in DR 1545. It was fought in the central [[Sentinel Range]] at [[Urlich Pass]], where the armies of [[Sembara]] and their allies met the forces of [[Cha'mutte]].

Later accounts often distinguish between the massed fighting in and around the pass, and the smaller, decisive struggle in which Cha'mutte was slain nearby—an act remembered as the war’s true turning point.

%% The prior stub text and notes are kept below for review:

The Battle of Urlich Pass, canonically now, was a large battle between Sembara + allies, including elves, and Cha'mutte's forces, mostly hobgoblins, with the HS party vs Cha'mutte happening within sight but not immediately in the pass itself. Vahaiya, elf now in [[Orenlas]], canonically fought in the Battle of Urlich Pass.
