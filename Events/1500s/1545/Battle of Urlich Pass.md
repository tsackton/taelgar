The Battle of Urlich Pass was the climactic battle of the [[Great War]] in DR 1545. It was fought in the central [[Sentinel Range]] at [[Urlich Pass]], where the armies of [[Sembara]] and [[Ainumarya]], and many allies, met the mostly [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] armies of [[Cha'mutte]].

The smaller combat between [[Cha'mutte]] himself and the [[Heroes of the Great War]] occurred nearby, within sight of the massed armies; [[Cha'mutte]]'s death marked the true end of the [[Great War]].
