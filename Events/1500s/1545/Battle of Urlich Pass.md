The Battle of Urlich Pass, canonically now, was a large battle between Sembara + allies, including elves, and Cha'mutte's forces, mostly hobgoblins, with the HS party vs Cha'mutte happening within sight but not immediately in the pass itself. Vahaiya, elf now in [[Orenlas]], canonically fought in the Battle of Urlich Pass.
