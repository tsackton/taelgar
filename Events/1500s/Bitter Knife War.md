# The Bitter Knife War

The Bitter Knife War was a long series of campaigns between [[Dunmar]] and a hobgoblin power known as the Bitter Knife, associated with the blasted plains of the [[Nashtkar]] on Dunmar’s eastern frontier. Dunmari histories place this war among the formative struggles of the early [[Nayan Dynasty]].

Later accounts treat the war as decisive: the Bitter Knife were eventually broken as a coherent force, and survivors—if any—were scattered into the wilderness.

## DM notes

- Date ranges in circulation include “DR 1550s, lasting ~30 years” and “DR 1559–1586”; reconcile against any future consolidated Nayan chronicle.
- A DM-facing summary describing the Bitter Knife as a hobgoblin slaver nation and framing the war as a key moment in cementing early Nayan rule appears in `Session 84 - Dunmar Notes` (in the `_DM_` folder).
