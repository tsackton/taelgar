The Bitter Knife War was a long series of campaigns fought between [[Dunmar]] and the Bitter Knife hobgoblin clan, remnants of Cha'mutte's army who occupied a large territory in the [[Nashtkar]] and the upper [[Kharja]] valley in the years after the [[Great War]]. Over a series of bitter campaigns lasting many years, the Bitter Knife hobgoblins were slowly crushed, and finally obliterated in DR 1586.

From DM notes but not necesarily canon:
DR 1559 - DR 1586: Bitter Knife Wars. A series of campaigns against a hobgoblin slaver nation established in the Kharja valley and east in the Nashtkar, during the early part of the Nayan Dynasty. The wars against the Bitter Knife clan cement the rule of the Nayan dynasty, in part as Nayan Kundar marches east with a large army -- both a show of force against the hobgoblins and an establishment of power over eastern Dunmar. 

DR: 1579: Nayan Kundar killed in battle against ogres and hobgoblins, during a campaign against the Bitter Knife. His son, Nayan Bhara, becomes Samraat.
