A major defeat for [[Chardon]] during the [[Conclave War]], when the dragon conclave unleashed their full might during the wars of the [[Blood Years]].  Fought on the banks of the [[Chasa]], about 250 miles northeast of [[Chardon]]. The [[Scar of Shadowfire|remnants of the dragonfire]] of this battle still scar the land, and nothing grows.
