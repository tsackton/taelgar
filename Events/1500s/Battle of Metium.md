> Part of The [[Conclave War]]

The Battle of Metium was a significant battle, generally understood as the key Chardonian victory during the [[Conclave War]], fought on the banks of the [[Chasa]] river near the city of [[Metium]]. It was a major, if costly, victory for [[Chardon]] and its allies, and marked deepest point of advance of the dragon conclave and allies during the [[Conclave War]]. While several minor battles against hobgoblins were fought after the Battle of Metium, this battle broke the power of the dragon conclave and functionally marked Chardon's victory in the Conclave War.
