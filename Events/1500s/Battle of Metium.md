The Battle of Metium was a significant battle during the [[Conclave War]], fought on the banks of the [[Chasa]]] river near the city of [[Metium]]. It was a great victory for [[Chardon]] and its allies, and marked deepest point of advance of the Draconic Triumvirate during the [[Conclave War]]. Generally acknowledged as the turning point of the [[Conclave War]]. During the battle, [[Arauthelden]] the Inferno Lord, an ancient red dragon, was killed, and the might and power of the Draconic Triumvirate was shattered. 

%% notes 
basic outline of conclave war is dragon conclave takes command of remnants of Cha'mutte's army and marches south, destroying as they go, eventually moving down the Chasa river valley.
forward advance stopped at the Battle of Metium only 50-60 miles upriver from Chardon
at that point war continues for a bit longer but Metium is turning point
