# The Great War

The Great War was the war against [[Cha'mutte]] and the vast armies he gathered—hobgoblins, monsters, and other allies—fought across [[Greater Sembara]] and beyond in the early 1540s DR. The war ended in DR 1545 with Cha'mutte’s defeat at the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]].

## Overview

In Sembaran tradition, the Great War is remembered as an existential war: a struggle not merely against invasion, but against an enemy who sought to overthrow the gods and break the ancient order of the world.

The most widely cited turning point is Cha'mutte’s death in DR 1545, which ended his direct command of the war and reshaped the aftermath of the conflict.

## Legacy

The Great War’s shadow falls long. Later histories connect Cha'mutte’s defeat to the creation of the [[Plaguelands]] and to the decades of turmoil and secondary wars that followed, often called the [[Blood Years]].
