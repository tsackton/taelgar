# The Great War

The Great War is the name given to the war against  [[Cha'mutte]] that united many human and non-human realms to fight against the vast armies of hobgoblins, monsters, and other allies gathered by [[Cha'mutte]]. It was fought on many fronts, with major battles involving [[Dunmar]], the [[Istabor Alliance]], [[Sembara]], and [[Chardon]], among others. The war ended in DR 1545 with Cha'mutte’s defeat by the [[Heroes of the Great War]] at the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]].

The Great War is remembered as an existential war: a struggle not merely against invasion, but against an implacable enemy who sought to destroy the very gods themselves and overthrow the order of the world.

## Legacy

The Great War still leaves a lasting legacy on the world today. The battles of the Great War and its aftermath reshaped the western coast, seeing Chardon turn from a city of mages and merchants to an imperial capital, while many of the other realms in this part of the world, including the great elven realm of [[Ainumarya]], were destroyed. In Dunmar, the landscape itself was radically altered, changing the climate. In the Green Sea, the Plaguelands grew where [[Cha'mutte's Plague]] had lain heaviest, and the passes through the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] at [[Urlich Pass]] were destroyed in a cataclysm upon Cha'mutte's death.

There is of course much more to say here. At some point I started to develop a detailed history of the Great War; parts of this still exist in various Deno'qai and Dunmari history notes. 

The main canonical events that must be incorporated into a timeline if ever developed are:
- The early battles against the northern Deno'qai, as described in the Delwath solo adventures
- Two major hobgoblin armies, in the north and the south, as outlined in [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]. The existence of Great-War-era fortifications along the [[Stoneway]] in Dunmar (defending against hobgoblins to the north) was part of the first few sessions of the Dunmar Fellowship.
- The plague and its effects on Dunmar and Isingue
- The [[Battle of Urlich Pass]] itself and the final defeat of Cha'mutte. 

From high school, the following are important:
- The various hobgoblin armies harassing Dunmar / Isingue especially from redoubts in the southern Sentinels. 
- The context of Pandar, kenku slaves, magically fed hobgoblin army pressing from the north

General conceptual requirements:
- There needs to be a conceptual reason why attacking Dunmar and Isingue, and especially cutting off travel between them, was so important to Cha'mutte that he was willing to sacrifice his own hobgoblin armies (at least in part) to the plague; this should also explain why there was so much devastation in eastern Dunmar and the upper Istaros.
- Cha'mutte needs a reason to care deeply about Ulrich monastery, to the extent where he is willing to fight to the death to hold it. Likely involves some kind of extraplanar weak point to divine realms here, or something like that.
