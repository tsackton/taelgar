```
%%^End%%

%% notes 
basic outline of conclave war is dragon conclave takes command of remnants of Cha'mutte's army and marches south, destroying as they go, eventually moving down the Chasa river valley.
forward advance stopped at the [[Battle of Metium]] only 50-60 miles upriver from Chardon
at that point war continues for a bit longer but Metium is turning point

Conclave war more or less refers to the eastern advance here, but the details of how everything connects is not clear yet.

Tim Notes:

Few tales came to Chardon of what happened in these woods after the Great War; in 1555 a great host of hobgoblins, trolls, cursed beasts of shadow, and other monsters, led by a conclave of dragons, defeated the Chardonians in two battles, the Battle of Kin-Aska on the banks of the Chasa River, and the [[Battle of Shadowfire]], only 250 miles northeast of Chardon. After a hasty retreat, and much sacrifice to slow the advance, this host was defeated in a great battle only 55 miles east of Chardon, the [[Battle of Metium]]. Rumors that, at great cost to themselves, many elves at fought a year's long delaying battle to weaken this host before it reached Chardon persist, although few know the truth.

Battles:

Battle of Kin-Aska

Kin-Aska was a city-state in the orbit of Chardon, but not part of Chardon. Completely destroyed in the Blood Wars.

[[Battle of Shadowfire]]

A huge defeat for Chardon and allies, where the dragon conclave unleashed devastation and drove the Chardonians west

[[Battle of Metium]]

Metium was a Chardonian outpost that was largely ruined in the wars, but resettled and rebuilt in the past 150 years.
