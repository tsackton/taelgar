%%WIP: Tim has additional details, mostly in OneNote from developing the Chasa River Valley / Elderwood, but some just in my head or implied on a couple of maps.%%

%% notes 
basic outline of conclave war is dragon conclave takes command of remnants of Cha'mutte's army and marches south, destroying as they go, eventually moving down the Chasa river valley.
forward advance stopped at the Battle of Metium only 50-60 miles upriver from Chardon
at that point war continues for a bit longer but Metium is turning point
