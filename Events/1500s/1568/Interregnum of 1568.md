The Interregnum of 1568 was a succession crisis in [[Sembara]] following the death of [[Blanche I|Queen Blanche I]]. Blanche’s sisters—the twins [[Anne]] and [[Elaine I]]—disputed the succession, and their rivalry split the court. In the end, [[Wisym I]], a cousin, was elevated as a compromise king, in hopes of ending the dispute.
