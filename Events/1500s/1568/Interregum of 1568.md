# The Interregum of 1568

The Interregum of 1568 was a succession crisis in [[Sembara]] following the death of [[Queen Blanche I|Blanche I]]. Blanche’s sisters—the twin daughters [[Anne]] and [[Elaine I]]—disputed the succession, and their rivalry split the court.

In the end, the nobles elevated [[Wisym I]]—a cousin of the twins—as a compromise king, in hopes of ending the dispute and avoiding an immediate dynastic war.
