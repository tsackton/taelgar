# The Cursed Cold

>[!info]+ Event Summary
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The Cursed Cold was a five‑month calamity that spread from the [[Plaguelands]] into the borderlands of [[Tyrwingha]] in DR 1583. Contemporary accounts describe unseasonable cold, crop failure, and famine; later stories connect the event to the sins of [[Anne]] and to the long shadow cast by the succession crisis of the 1560s–1580s.

It is said that the spread was halted only after [[The Rangers]] and other adventurers ventured into the Plaguelands and “healed the land”.

%% Old notes (kept for review; the vault contains only partial corroboration for some specifics): 

No real information other than the below and backlinks.

Starting in the Tyrwinghan marches, rangers and others exploring in the Plaguelands notice that fires radiate cold, not heat, and the days get progressively colder as the sun rises, warming again at night. Cooking is impossible, and plants begin to freeze and die. The effect seems to spread along ley lines, out of the Plaguelands, and eventually begins to move into settled areas of Tyrwingha, reaching as far as the River Ernst and the eastern parts of Addermarch (but sparing the Tyrwinghan capitol, thankfully). People panic and flee, but many die in the great famines this causes before an expedition into the Plaguelands heals the land. Many believe this is divine retribution for Anne’s magic, and this strengthens a general distrust of arcane magic in Sembara.

## DM notes

- This note keeps several vivid “cold fire / ley line” details in comments, since the clearest vault corroboration currently located is the high-level timeline mention and the reference in [[Arryn I]].
