Starting in the Tyrwinghan marches, rangers and others exploring in the Plaguelands notice that fires radiate cold, not heat, and the days get progressively colder as the sun rises, warming again at night. Cooking is impossible, and plants begin to freeze and die. The effect seems to spread along ley lines, out of the Plaguelands, and eventually begins to move into settled areas of Tyrwingha, reaching as far as the River Ernst and the eastern parts of Addermarch (but sparing the Tyrwinghan capitol, thankfully). People panic and flee, but many die in the great famines this causes before an expedition into the Plaguelands heals the land. Many believe this is divine retribution for Anne’s magic, and this strengthens a general distrust of arcane magic in Sembara.
