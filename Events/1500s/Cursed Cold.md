# The Cursed Cold

>[!info]+ Event Summary
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The Cursed Cold was a five‑month calamity that spread from the [[Plaguelands]] into the borderlands of [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], and southern [[Sembara]], as far as parts of the [[Enst]] valley, in DR 1583. In areas affected by the curse, fire radiated cold, not heat, and the days got colder as the sun rose, warming at night. Cooking was impossible, and plants began to freeze and die. Famine and death spread quickly, as many fled the affected regions (which, fortunately, did not include [[Tafolwern]] or [[Eskbridge]], but did include many smaller villages in eastern [[Addermarch]], [[Tyrwingha]], and the lower [[Enst]]). Many people blamed the Cursed Cold on divine retribution of [[Anne]]'s magic. 

It is said that the spread was halted only after [[The Rangers]] and other adventurers ventured into the [[Plaguelands]] and defeated the curse at its source, although the exact nature of this mission is not widely known.
