The first of three major wars between [[Sembara]] and allies and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]]. This war began when the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] crossed the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in force, attacking across the southwestern frontier of [[Sembara]]. It ended with in a stalemate: the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] advance was halted, but hobgoblins remained established in parts of the [[Western Marches]] and in the western edges of [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]].

This is the first attempt by the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] to establish a homeland or realm in the upper Enst valley. The logic in [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]] has the Shattered Ice hobgoblins moving east across the Sentinels after escaping destruction in the Conclave War, and attacking Sembara. 

The exact borders of the hobgoblin territory at the end of the war is, I think, not canonically settled beyond a general "western marches / western Maseau" vibe, basically along the edges of the Sentinels but certainly not extending far east enough for the [[Barony of Aveil]] to be the frontier. 

This war potentially involved mindflayers as allies or leaders of the hobgoblins; if so it may have been the setting for the Stone titan one-shot (though the [[Sentinel Range War]] is also plausible here). 

Important canonical details:
* Dates are approximately 1574 - 1578; these don't need to be precise, but it needs to have ended a year or two before [[Wisym I]] so that the events related to [[Elaine I]] and [[Anne]] are not taking place during a war
* Sembara largely was successful at pushing back the hobgoblins, but it established a strong idea in imagination that "dangers come from the west" and the rise of the [[Army of the West]] to preeminence should date from this period
