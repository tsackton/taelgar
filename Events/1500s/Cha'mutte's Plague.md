# Cha'mutte's Plague

During the closing stages of the [[Great War]], [[Cha'mutte]] created a magical plague of red mist that spread through parts of the [[Upper Istaros]] and [[Greater Dunmar]]. The plague choked the land and the aftereffects led to the destruction of [[Isingue]] and many of the great cities of eastern [[Dunmar]], such as [[Kharsan]].

Still a lot to confirm here, but the aftereffects in the current day are largely confined to a broad semicircle from more or less the [[Kharja]] sweeping northeast to the [[Istaros Watershed]].
