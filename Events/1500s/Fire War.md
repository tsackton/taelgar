# The Fire War

%% there is a bunch of history of the early blood years in Tokra that needs a more detailed proper chronology %%

A short war between the Dunmari and a horde of orcs, trolls, and ogres led by the fire giant [[Mavdyr]], between DR 1552-53.

The war began when Mavdyr's horde emerged from the east in the summer of DR 1552. [[Tokra]] was leveled, the defenses of the [[Hara]] river breached and overrun. 

Some survivors were able to retreat to the [[Lakan Monastery]], however. While [[Mavdyr]] lay siege to the monastery, the magical protections built into its walls were strong, and with constant prayers the defenses held for over a year, until the siege was broken by [[Dwarves]] and [[Stoneborn]] out of the north as the monsoon rains began in DR 1553. 

The [[Dwarves]], some of the last [[Dwarves]] to abandon their strongholds in the [[Sentinel Range]], and on their way to the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], stayed for a year to help rebuild [[Tokra]], and the legacy of Dwarven construction can still be seen today. The stoneborn left, but impressed with the valor and knowledge of the Lakan monks, promised to return and provide what aid they could.
