# The Fog of Mawar
>[!info]+ Information
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

A enchanted fog summoned by the druids of coast and wood, the salt [[lizardfolk]], and many others working together in the aftermath of the [[Grand Conclave of Mawakel]]. It came at great cost, and required endless vigilance along the borders. But as a result the weather, for much of the next fifty years, was made to protect the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

It lasted from 1545 until it was dismissed by the [[Grand Conclave of Mawakel|second conclave]] in 1590.
