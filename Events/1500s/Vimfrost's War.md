# Vimfrost's War
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

A war fought between the allies and minions of the ancient white dragon [[Vimfrost]], including orcs, trolls, and various monstrosities from the north, and the united forces of the frost giants of [[Kaldhalla]], dwarves and stoneborn of the [[Sivnjo Mountains]], and the human armies of [[Sembara]] and [[Vostok]]. 

Ultimately, the united forces under [[Derik III]] and [[Bjarnfrost]] defeated [[Vimfrost]], albeit at great cost, including the death of [[Bjarnfrost]]. 

During the course of [[Vimfrost's War]], the vast, ancient wall that stretches across much of northern [[Vostok]], known as the [[Grastenvakt|Gråstenvakt]], was rediscovered and partially repaired.

Vimfrost's war is fought, between the ancient white dragon Vimfrost and allies on one side, and the united army of [[Kaldhalla]], Sembara, Zimka/Voskald, and the Skaer. However, while Vimfrost is defeated, few frost giants return to [[Kaldhalla]], and Jokulvarr is killed. 

Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok from the north. 

Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by  [[Zimkova]], around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III.
