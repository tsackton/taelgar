The Attempted Geas of Elaine I is the name later chroniclers give to the magical coercion attempted against [[Elaine I]] during the succession crisis that followed the death of [[Wisym I]]. The attempt failed, and Elaine was ultimately crowned queen; in the aftermath, [[Anne]] was condemned for treason and executed.
