# The Attempted Geas of Elaine I

The Attempted Geas of Elaine I is the name later chroniclers give to the magical coercion attempted against [[Elaine I]] during the succession crisis that followed the death of [[Wisym I]]. The attempt failed, and Elaine was ultimately crowned queen; in the aftermath, [[Anne]] was condemned for treason and executed.

%% AI note: The vault’s currently available notes describe the broad outline (a magical attempt to force abdication; subsequent execution and exile) more consistently than the exact spellcasting details implied by the event name. %%

## DM notes

- Some sources date the attempt to DR 1582, with Anne’s execution occurring the following year; confirm the exact timing against any future consolidated Sembaran royal chronicle.
