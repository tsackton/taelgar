The War of the Dark Rift was a devastating war fought on [[Apporia]]. During a period of 13 years, the [[Umbral Covenant]] largely conquered northern [[Apporia]], save for the coastal plain of [[Raziolo]] and some fortified parts of [[Cedrano]]. The war ended when the Chardonian navy destroyed the Shadow Armada of the [[Umbral Covenant]] in the [[Gulf of Chardon]]. 

Chardonian writers often treat the war as a turning point: the moment [[Chardon]] became an imperial naval power and began to believe it was strong, and the beginnings of Chardonian expansion into [[Apporia]].

Basic outline:

- Umbral Covenant emerges from [[Cairn Dor]] (see GL dm notes above) in the interior of Apporia. 
- The formerly thriving dwarven (and maybe elven?) populations in the interior are destroyed. The dwarves entirely so, the elves mostly so, with the few survivors retreating to stoneborn communities, who become isolated bastions of safety. 
- A few years later, the Umbral Covenant breaks out of the mountains, attacking into the coast. Upland Cedrano is conquered, Portalia is destroyed, and the canal is damaged/taken. This is definitive end of the pirate kingdoms, who retreat south into Emerald Bay. This is a violent occupation. Anyone caught is killed, chaos reigns, and any kind of rulership is gone. People struggle just to survive and hide. This is also a really rough time for halflings on the Gulf of Chardon, who are hunted and summarily executed. 
- In 1590s sometime, enemy builds an armada, aiming to attack Chardon. This is the instigator of Chardon's turn into a naval power. 
- Chardon wins, conquers Portalia, repairs the canal, and wins a series of wars in the inland. Raziolo is already well-fortified, having survived; Cedrano is basically unassailable from land (and also survived). More forts are built in the inland, for a generation watch is kept, and communication flows between stoneborn redoubts and Chardonians. Raziolo is still independent at this point.
