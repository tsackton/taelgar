# The War of the Dark Rift

The War of the Dark Rift was a devastating war fought on [[Apporia]] in the late 16th century DR. Most public histories focus on the rise of the [[Umbral Covenant]] and the climactic naval battle in which Chardon destroyed the “Shadow Armada” that threatened the [[Gulf of Chardon]].

Chardonian writers often treat the war as a turning point: the moment Chardon became an imperial naval power and began extending direct authority over Apporia and the [[Old Chardon Canal]].
