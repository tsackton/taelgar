%% @Mike: setting status/check on all Sembaran history events %%

A war fought in the western highlands in the years after the [[Great War]]. 

%% 
The existence of the war is referenced in multiple places and is definitely canonical, but the identity of the enemy and the exact sequence of events are not invented. 

The “Stone Titan” starter adventure may have taken place during this war; while the broad plot may be canonical the details/PCs are not necessarily.
