An agreement between the [[Emperor Goristo]] and the [[Archfey Ethlenn]] signed in DR 423.

%%
 This land had been protected by the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], the Queen of the Evening Mist, for many generations, and the conquerors had not her blessing. It is said that the greatest wizards of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] refused to aid the conquest, recognizing Ethlenn’s great power, and the legions of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], feared throughout the world, threw down their arms. Whether this tales are true or not, it is known that the Empire did not conqueror [[Tyrwingha]]. Yet the Archfey greatly desired to learn the secrets of [[Hkar]] from Drankorian mages, and so a compromise was made. The Archfey would acknowledge the Drankorians as rulers of the land, and welcome their gods, the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] to the land, in exchange for tribute in the form of secret knowledge. Any Tyrwinghans who did not want to live under Drankorian rule would be allowed to depart for the [[Feywild]], to live in the court of the Archfey. Even now, tradition holds that all subjects of the Tyrwinghan crown may choose to invoke their right to leave, trading their oaths of loyalty for a life in the court of the Archfey. Although Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations, a few desparate or fey-touched choose this gamble even now.
