DR: 402
---

The Treaty of Marhavn ('Mar-hahvn') was signed by [[Emperor Goristo]] in DR 402. This treaty established the Volta as the northern border of the Drankorian Empire, and made the Skaer and other descendants of the ancient mariner cultures living in what is now Sembara and Cymea into imperial subjects.

This treaty forbids the Skaer from bringing ships up the [[Volta]].
