# The Treaty of Marhavn
>[!info]+ Information
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue")`

The Treaty of Marhavn ('Mar-hahvn') was signed by [[Goristo]] in DR 402. This treaty established the [[Volta]] as the northern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], and made the [[Skaer]] and other descendants of the ancient mariner cultures living in what is now Sembara and Cymea into imperial subjects.

This treaty forbids the Skaer from bringing ships up the [[Volta]].

%% notes/brainstorming:

- What Marhavn is is not invented, but probably a place.
- Tangentially impinges on some Skaer history brainstorming, relating to idea of Skaer has having expansionist and isolationist strands (perhaps divinely influenced), and the Treaty of Marhavn marking a shift to isolationism. A possible idea is that the Skaer did not greatly resist this treaty as the isolationist strand perhaps became dominant -- by divine influence for some undetermined reason -- somewhat _before_ conflict with Drankorians.
