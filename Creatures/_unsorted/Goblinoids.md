# Goblinoids

%% adding check/mike. i think for now i'm happy leaving this as campaign-none basic facts and brainstorming. feel free to add anything and bounce back; if looks reasonable for now change status to stub and remove check. can also delete comments at end if adequately captured %%

%%^Campaign:none%%

## Basic Facts

(1) Hobgoblins have a well-developed metaphysics and vibe and play a very important role in Taelgar history. See: [[Hobgoblins]] (which is very thin and needs to be improved), and many other sources for indirect details. 

(2) While in "base D&D" and in early drafts of goblinoids notes in Taelgarverse goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears are all considered a single group of "goblinoids" created by the same god, with goblins as the slaves/servants of hobgoblins and bugbears as the shock troops. However, there is not actually any Taelgar canon that supports this. 

Goblins have been introduced in canonical games a lot. They were central to the [[Labyrinths of the Lost]] game; they appeared in one Addermarch adventure ([[Addermarch - Session 04]] and [[Addermarch - Session 05]]; and they made an appearance in the Great Library campaign ([[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 1]]). They also made an appearance in the non-canonical work two-session adventure Tim ran. 

However, in none of these adventures were goblins described or portrayed as slaves or servants of hobgoblins. In Addermarch they were an independent group that was operating as bandits kind of on the fringes of a stronger hobgoblin group; in Labyrinths of the Lost they were servants to a mad scientist; in Addermarch they were bandits operating alone. Furthermore, hobgoblins have come up occasionally in play (e.g,. the [[Empress of Chaos]] arc) and extensively in historical documentation, and have never had large quantities of goblin slaves or servants. 

Bugbears have only come up occasionally as random monsters in Great Library games, never in association with hobgoblins. More typically, they have served the roll of something like ogres, just random brutes to use in a fight. There is no canonical evidence that bugbears should even be treated as a real species with any kind of unique culture. Indeed, in the Great Library campaign the two times they are used were (a) as a brute squad for orcs, and (b) as servants of a black dragon. So this points away to some kind of unified culture and more towards something more like an ogre/troll vibe. 

(3) There are some tenuous links, however, between goblins and hobgoblins.  
- The "Goblin" language has been interpreted in play to be useful for understanding both Hobgoblins and Goblins, although this is relatively simple to retcon if desired. 
- The names Hobgoblin and Goblin are obviously similar and imply some kind of shared ancestry. 

## Implications for Goblins

It seems clear that from a game-as-canon point of view, goblins (a) definitely exist, but (b) should not be considered to have any kind of obvious connection to hobgoblins, and certainly not exist primarily as their slaves and servants. 

This leaves open the question of where they came from, and about language and name. 

Origin:
- Fey is an obvious choice, and one that 5e 2024 made. However, the challenge here is goblins don't feel feywild-native. One suggestion from Mike is that they are fey who were exiled from the Feywild, and so are functionally fey native to the Material Plane. This has potential and should be considered. 
- It might be worth considering if there is an alternative that involves the goblins being the first attempt of the Void Mind or something, a failed experiment of some kind. 
- Are their other explanations?
- Do we need an explanation?

Name:
- This could just be ignored, it doesn't necessarily need an in-game explanation. 
- Alternatively, maybe goblins did often end up serving as servants/cannon fodder in Cha'mutte's armies for some reason, or even in the downfall armies. From this a diminutive name came into being, which has stuck. 

Language:
- It is most likely simplest to just retcon this. Goblins might not have a native tongue, really. Some might speak Sylvan while many speak only Common or speak the local human tongue. 

## Implications for Bugbears

Bugbears are clearer in the sense there is no canonical reason to consider them to be a real species that needs extensive development (e.g. they are more ogres than orcs). They are much more fey-like in vibe than goblinoid anyway. 

They could take the "exiled fey" backstory instead of or in addition to goblins. They also don't have to be exiled and could be more like satyrs - often found on the Material Plane but also common in the Feywild. 

## Old Notes

This are explicitly not correct but kept for posterity. *Note that some other notes still imply or state this history and will need to be changed at some point, perhaps when this is de-stubbed.*

- Created by the Void Mind; hobgoblins are supposed to be like humans but lack the divine spark. instead of being endowed with the power to create things from belief they are endowed with the belief they are superior or something like that. the point is these are the Taelgar Nazi Party basically, the bad guys you can always safely fight without feeling guilty. 
	- Haven't decided yet whether, like the orcs, they have a way to escape this evil destiny
- The Void Mind also created the [[Goblins]], to be their servants and slaves, and the bugbears, to be their warriors. 
	- [[Goblins]] are probably the most "sympathetic" of the goblinoids; probably seen equally with pity and scorn if they escape. you could imagine some [[Goblins]] living happy quiet lives far from anyone, others imitating their hobgoblin masters if they get free, others serving as pawns, intentionally or not, in hobgoblin games
		- The work one-shot I ran (questionably canon) followed this, a local goblin tribe was not really much of a nuisance until a hobgoblin leader showed up and took over
	- Bugbears I'm not sure about

%% notes

Thoughts from Mike:
* Are bugbears necessarily canonical? I see they came up in one or two Great Library arcs but could that be retconned to particularly fearsome hobgoblins, or something in the ogre/troll family, i.e. more like a monster and not a real species per se?
* Hobgoblins have a very well-developed vibe that appears to be fairly unique and interesting, although not well captured on this page. 
* Goblins clearly exist - they've been used, I believe, in several canonical games, although I'm not sure if they came up in Dunmar Frontier. I haven't used them in Cleenseau but I believe they've been mentioned in backstory.
* Is it necessary to have bugbears at all? They seem to be an odd fit and not mentioned much. Could they been some mad experienment of mixing hobgoblins with bears or something, that just happened once, if needed?
* Are goblins actually hobgoblin servants and slaves? Any thoughts on whether they are actually fey instead?

In my conception of hobgoblins, goblins have never come up,, nor can I remember them coming up in any Dunmar frontier arc, i.e. the Empress of Chaos didn't appear to have goblin slaves hanging around the army camp, etc. Are we sure they are hobgoblin slaves not something else?
