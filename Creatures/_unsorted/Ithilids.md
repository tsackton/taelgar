Aberrations from the Far Realm. 

%%
Notes from old emails:
So far my idea is that they are really alien, far realm types per standard D&D lore, which I intepret to mean their motivations should be hard to fathom / nonsensical.   
  
They eat brains, so need a ready supply of slaves, which drives some of their conflict with surface races, dwarves, etc.   
  
But they also don't need to have 'standard' motives. Maybe they like the feeling of sensing the emotions of loss and death and pain coming from humans and don't really see them as conscious beings, and so destroy them as like a gourmet delicacy.  
  
And of course not all mind flayers have same motives. Some are more connected to building power, amassing slaves, others to more esoteric ends.

One thing I do know about them is that they are well known as a slaver race. Slavery is super rare in Taelgar because the gods dislike it, so Elder races basically can't be slavers and human societies that condone slavery lose the protection of the gods, which rarely goes well unless they can find other gods. Still working on details exactly but I want slavery to be a clear marker of 'this is a group of bad guys you can kill without feeling guilty'.

%% the main DM notes I have are from Raven's Hold:

History of Dwarven Outpost after Great War:

Gradually, creatures of the deep dark crept into the abandoned spaces, establishing lairs in places where they could hunt and find prey or food. Slowly, a few thralls (grimlocks and derros) of the mind flayers in the deeps, crept up here, some to escape and live in peace, others as spies on the outside world.

Grimlocks and derros are creatures created in the image of humans and dwarves by mind flayers, to be their worshippers, servants, thralls, and slaves. Most of them worship mind flayers, and feel their purpose is to grow stronger, acquire slaves and treasure, and find their mind flayer overlords again. A few, however, are "atheists" who just want to live in peace and quiet. The derro tend towards paranoia and madness, while the grimlocks are fervent cultists, or in the case of those who have rejected the mind flayer cult, scared and timid.

16: Temple of the Mind Flayer

This room, formerly a temple to the Bahrazel, has been radically defaced. Seven statues of the Bahrazel have been beheaded and badly damaged; an intricately carved altar has been piled with refuse and offal, stench dripping off it. On the altar, a crude sculpture of a humanoid head, with a elongated forehead and tentacles where a mouth should be, sits staring with deep black eyes at the room.

The grimlock fanatic, two grimlock sneakers, and four grimlock warriors are here at almost all times, all devoted cult worshippers of the ithilid.

The grimlocks have little use for treasure, and there is nothing to find here.

Other notes are much vaguer:

- Mind flayers were a key part of the destruction of Ardith. Exactly how is not determined
- Mind flayers were part of the stone titan attack from the intro one-shot, although details of that game are not considered necessarily canon

Mike's speculative notes on types of mind flayers suggests that it would be sensible for there to be two types in the large plot arc of Cleenseau:
- a cult of nihilist mind flayers who simply want to destroy the world  
- non-nihilist mind flayers would like to destroy the soul jar and use the chaltye golem to enslave the human realms
