# Creature Rules in Taelgar

This page is contains guidelines for adapting D&D rules around creatures to Taelgar metaphysics. For background on the metaphysics of creatures, see [[Metaphysics of Creatures]]. For mechanical details of species available to PCs, see [[Playable Species of Taelgar]]. 

%% Mike: complete rewrite - add notes where needed %%

## Categories of Creatures

There are four broad categories of creatures that exist in Taelgarian metaphysics, elaborated on in more detail in [[Metaphysics of Creatures]]. Except as noted, all these creatures, by the nature of their subjective perceptions, attract and accrete [[Soulstuff]], linking them to the [[Plane of Souls]]. This 

* **Creatures**: these are sentient natives of one of the many planes in the multiverse; unlike species, they are not expected to have a single unique origin story or shared history. The trolls that one adventuring party fights in the Plaguelands might be metaphysically unrelated to the trolls another party fights in the Blackwater Fens. Note there are important subsets of creatures based on plane of origin. Creatures might have pages on ecology and tendencies. 
* **Species**: these are creatures with a unique culture and language, and continuity across the world. There might be many different human, dragon, or kenku cultures, but they share an evolution, common history, and overarching narrative. Everything  in this category should have a single origin story for how it came to be and spread across the world, even though that origin story may not have been invented yet. Natives of any Inner Plane, or the Far Realms, can be species. Natives of Spiritual Realms 
* **Constructs**: these are sentient creatures that are not really thinking creatures at all, but are animated by some magic which mimics sentience. They do not have souls at all and are rendered inanimate when killed, unless some magic restores them.
* **Transformations**: these are sentient creatures that were once members of a species, or a different creature, but have been transformed, either during life or after death, into some new form. This category covers a diverse array of possible things, from undead to lycanthropes to twisted/monstrous corruptions of species into new things. The key distinction is that transformations are defined by a process of creation, such as the curse of lycanthropy or the animate dead spell, and thus fundamentally cannot have a single origin story. A transformation that arose once at a specific point in history, and now only exists as descendants of that original event, might be better classified as a species, but generally this should be avoided unless important for story reasons. 

A fifth broad category, **divinities** exists, which define creatures that have accreted so much soulstuff (via their own powerful essence or a gift from elsewhere) that they have transcended any usual concept of mortality. They have various creation/origin stories, but typically each arise as unique individuals in unique circumstances, and are largely represented by notes in the `God and Religion` directory instead of the `Creatures` directory. Note that there are at least four broad categories of divinities -- High Gods, Embodied Gods, Incorporeal Gods, and "Demigods" -- which are not well defined metaphysically but not discussed further here. 

## Introducing New Creatures to Taelgar

Any D&D monster or playable species, or any wild idea anyone has, can potentially fit into Taelgar in some way, though not everything will. The following outlines the general questions that need to be resolved to place a creature into Taelgarian metaphysics. Any sentient being introduced to Taelgar should be considered a creature by default. 

### Is It a Species?

New species should be introduced cautiously, as species need to have a place in lore in a way that creatures, constructs, and transformations don't. It is easier to promote a creature to a species later than the reverse, so until there is some in-game lore generated and canonical experience with a species, it is best not to rush. An exception is if species lore and backstory is needed for development of a campaign or campaign arc (e.g., a campaign arc around attacking a mind flayer slave camp in the Underdark might require decisions about whether mind flayers are species or creatures native to the Far Realms).

To introduce a species requires, minimally, a sense of their origin story and historical development, though these do not need to be extensively detailed. Some idea about their metaphysics, souls, and religion are useful as well. 

#### Origin Story

A central thing that makes a species a species is their unique origin story. So far, there are three relatively well developed classes of origin stories, and then three catch-all categories. Carefully consider what kind of origin story makes sense for a new species. 

**Children of the Embodied Gods:** These are species that were directly created by one of the [[Embodied Gods]], a unique category of divine being endowed with a physical manifestation by the [[Divine Presence]] (though note the exact metaphysics of what determines whether something is an Embodied God vs Incorporeal God vs High God is not fully developed). Species with this origin story should have unique magical abilities granted by their connection to their divine creator. Metaphysically, this is represented by these species receiving a gift of soulstuff from their divine creators, which gives them power; upon death this soulstuff is assumed to pass into the beyond to be reclaimed and rejoin these divinities, whatever that might mean. The term "Firstborn" is often used to refer to the creator god or gods of a given species in this category. 

Canonically includes:  [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk]], [[Halflings]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Orcs]]
New creations in this category need compelling justification, and significant world building to integrate into existing history. New creations in this category also need to be tied to a new Embodied God. It is assumed that each Embodied God creates only a single species. 

Notes: 
- Historically species in this category have been assumed to have more fixed cultural traits than other species, and to have fixed languages that do not change over time and drift into new languages. Several of these species are canonically much more long-lived than humans, and this can introduce unusual biology. 
- There is unlikely to be space for new inventions in this category, except potentially around new embodied gods created by the Void Mind; e.g., potentially some "evil" species could exist that was largely wiped out during the Downfall and now only has a presence in strange lands to the south, or something like that. 

**Direct Creations of a High God:** These species are those that were directly and intentionally created by a High God, either the [[Divine Presence]] or the [[Void Mind]]. These species are unique in their categories and it is likely that no new invention in this category is possible. The specific details of human and hobgoblin creation stories are covered elsewhere. Humans, unlike any other known species on Taelgar, are the direct creations of the Divine Presence breathing the essence of creation, the divine spark, into material form. Metaphysically, [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] are also in this category, though they are the spawn of the [[Void Mind]], acting in secret to steal and twist the power of the [[Divine Presence]]. Humans and hobgoblins both have unique metaphysics and details of their souls. 

Canonically includes: [[Humans]], [[Hobgoblins]]. 
New creations in this category are probably not possible. 

Notes: 
- In some way, the direct creation of humans is tied to the [[Divine Spark]] and a variety of concepts around [[Incorporeal Gods]], though this is not fully developed and many ideas are not fully canonical. 
- [[Hobgoblins]] are canonically associated with anti-soulstuff or at least the absence of soulstuff.
- See: [[Historical Framework]] and [[Historical Framework - Open Questions]] for more about humans and hobgoblins

**Echoes of Ancient Powers:** These species have some origin story connected, in a vague or loose way at least, with the events prior to the [[Riving]] and with entities that existed in some form or another during the [[Primordial Cosmos]]. The origin story of these species is often poorly developed; however, there should be a strong sense of powerful magic for any species in this category, which should be reserved for species that at least potentially can be extraordinarily powerful. There are no real canonical details about the metaphysics of creatures in this category, except that typically these species should be defined by an ability to accrete very large amounts of soulstuff, but they should not receive gifted soulstuff from divine realms. 

Canonically includes: [[Dragons]], [[Giants]]
New types of giants and dragons are relatively safe to invent, though keep in mind the need for a shared history and origin story. Creatures like ogres, cyclops, and wyverns are likely better treated as "creatures" or "transformations". New species in this category require some thought, primarily to avoid overloading the world with too many extremely powerful creatures. 

Notes:
- These species arose not from a creator god, but from some kind of power and ancient magic of creation. Given their potentially great power and long life, many of the strongest of these creatures accrete large amounts of soulstuff, and there is the potential for deity-like entities or even true Divinities to have arisen out of the strongest of these creatures.
- There is a vibe, though not canonically developed, that these species generally don't have religion. If they do have religion, they likely worship ascended members of their own species, who accreted sufficient soulstuff to function like divinities, but are not related in any real metaphysical way to the [[Divine Presence]] or even necessarily the [[Spiritual Realms]]. 
- This is really intended to be a category for powerful and intelligent species that clearly need a culture but don't fit as natives of other planes; the unifying feature here is really the potential to accrete very large amounts of soulstuff and reach high CR. 
- From Tim: I am committed to the idea that dragons and giants are somehow echoes or representatives or creations or something of pre-Riving powers, but the exact details should probably be left intentionally hazy. This does not have to involve the Divine Presence - they could be magic made flesh or something, created out of the Plane of Magic somehow, for example. 
- Vibe from older notes: " Once, in the ancient days before the [[Riving]], when the multiverse was young and magic was strong, great powers walked the earth, reshaping it on a whim. Though few know the ultimate fate of these powers, or whether any still live today, folklore claims that the [[Giants|giants]] and [[Dragons|dragons]] trace their origins to the [[Primordial Cosmos]] in some fashion."

**Transformed Species:** Some species might fit best with an origin story that involves a unique split or transformation from another species with different origin story. There are no canonical examples of this that have been invented, although brainstorming around gnomes suggests they are the sundered surface cousins of dwarves. Generally, these species need a unique transformative event in their history. This should be used sparingly - most transformations do not need to be species. Metaphysically, these species will usually inherit the metaphysics of their original species prior to the transformation, unless the transformative event specifically changed the nature of their souls, which could be possible. 

Canonically includes: nothing
Tentatively includes: [[Gnomes]]

Notes:
- This is a pretty loose category that does not have much invention behind it yet, but could be useful. 

**Other Species:** A catch-all category for everything that doesn't fit into the above categories. This is generally either species with a unique and hard-to-categorize creation story, or species with no creation story invented yet but which do not obviously fit into another category. The metaphysics of these species depends on their creation story and might vary widely. 

Canonically includes: [[Kenku]], [[Merfolk]], [[Centaurs]]
Currently also includes:  [[Goblins]], [[Kobolds]], [[Fae]], [[Fairies]]
Possibly also includes: [[Ithilids]], [[Bullywugs]], [[Dragonets]], [[Djinn]], [[Azer]], [[Efreeti]], [[Dao]], [[Marid]], [[Aboleths]]

Notes:
- Many of the species in this category simply have no origin story or metaphysics invented, and some might not even be species. They are likely in the "unique" category, but might not be. These include:
	- Fae, Fairies - natives of the Feywild; definitely species but origin story very unclear
	- Goblins - almost certainly a species but origin story very unclear; could, for example, be transformations of hobgoblins somehow granted the ability to accrete soulstuff
	- Kobolds - definitely a species and very likely in this category, but origin story not invented
	- Dragonets - might not be a species; if they are, might be transformations from dragons; if not, might just have a unique and interesting population on the circular island
	- Bullywugs - might not be a species; if they are, might be a transformation from something, most likely a non-species 
	- Djinn, Azer, Efreeti, Dao, Marid - natives of the elemental planes; very likely most/all of these are species, but details of how elemental planes natives arise is unclear. Could be echoes of ancient powers, for example; in an earlier conception of deep history the "elder elementals" were part of the primordial cosmos. 
	- Aboleths, Ithilids - invaders from Far Realms; might not even be species
- Only kenku, centaurs, and merfolk have enough invented about their origin to canonically be in this category

#### Metaphysics of Souls

The other thing that must be considered for a species is the metaphysics of its soul, and how it accretes soulstuff. There are three broad categories here, loosely tied to the origin story. 

**Gifted Soulstuff**: Many species, including all the children of embodied gods and humans, are gifted soulstuff by a divinity upon birth. Species with this metaphysics are the only species whose souls travel beyond the Land of the Death to join divinities in the Spiritual Realms after death. Generally requires religion and a close relationship with gods for this metaphysics to work, though not all metaphysical details of this process are fully resolved. 

**Accrete Soulstuff**: This should generally be the default position in the absence of any more specific invention. Most species accrete soulstuff by their sentient nature. Because they are also sapient, that soulstuff persists for some time after death, but accreted soulstuff eventually returns to their native plane, to some undetermined fate which might be simply merging back with the ambient soulstuff of that plane, or might be something more complex, but should be distinct from the category above. 

**No Soulstuff:** Natives of the Far Realms generally won't accrete soulstuff, and so may not have a soul at all in the Taelgarian sense. Hobgoblins are special case, created to actively repel soulstuff; they also don't have Taelgarian souls. 

#### Native Plane

Species can be native to three different places. 

**Material Plane:** This is the most common answer, and should likely be the default unless it is obviously not appropriate. 
**Inner Planes**: Many species are native to the Feywild or one of the Elemental Planes. There probably aren't species native to other Inner Planes (such as the Plane of Magic, or postulated Positive/Negative Energy Realms), but technically their could be. Note that generally origin stories of species native to somewhere that is not the Material Plane don't exist yet, so there are some fuzzy details about creation here; it is especially unclear whether it is possible for natives of other planes to have gifted soulstuff, and if so what that might mean. 
**Far Realms**: Species that come from a specific Far Realm, and have a unique creation story in that Far Realm, and a unified history on Taelgar, also exist. Note that while many Far Realms in D&D are flavored as eldritch horrors, this does not have to be the case; see, for example, [[Merfolk]] and the [[Sentient Ocean]]. 

Note: species cannot be native to the Spiritual Realms. Natives of the Spiritual Realms are always creatures, with any culture and history tied to the plane they are from as much as them. In some sense, natives of the Spiritual Realms are simple extensions of the Spiritual Realms themselves. 

### Is It a Construct or Transformation?

Creatures that are not species might still be either constructs or transformations. 

---


%% see notes and open questions below - significant revisions to bring up to date with reality of actual play to date%%

The multiverse, gods, and the story of creation are organized somewhat differently in Taelgar than a standard D&D universe. Still, most, if not all, D&D creatures can fit in somewhere. Here are some guidelines.

###  Natives of the Inner Realms

Sentient creatures -- those that can feel and perceive subjective experiences -- include the vast majority of creatures that inhabit the Material Plane that one might typically encounter. 

This connection is stronger for sapient creatures, and strongest for those who are also connected to a Divinity. When these creatures die, the accumulated [[Soulstuff]] that makes up their soul typically passes to the [[Land of the Dead]], to whatever fate awaits. 



4. **Corrupted Species.** A number of sentient, self-aware creatures or species were originally something else, but have been cursed or corrupted in some way, often by agents of the [[Void Mind]]. The most common of these are lycanthropes, but others may exist. This category can also include creatures such as the [[Derro]], once dwarves whose connection to the [[Bahrazel]] was severed by mind flayers to create slaves for their underground empires. Undead are a special category of corrupted species; see [[Undead]] for more discussion. 

	- Creation: Corrupted from a different category. 
	- Metaphysics: Depends on their original category, although in some cases the "corruption" process may change their metaphysics, particularly if, for example, a divine connection is severed. A subset of undead are simply animated bodies that lack a soul entirely, though many undead are instead souls unnaturally trapped on the Material Plane after death. 
	- *Canonical examples include (incomplete list):  [[Lycanthropes]], [[Derro]], [[Grimlocks]], [[Undead]].
	* ***New creations tied to existing aberrations or existing aspects of the Void Mind are relatively straightforward to introduce, but novel Void Mind aspects might require some thought.***  

5. **Unusual Species**. Many species, of course, have unique origins that do not neatly fit into any of the categories above. Any species that is native to the [[Material Plane]], is sapient, and does not fit neatly into any of the above categories can fit here.

	- Creation: Complex and species dependent. A species in this category should have a unique origin story, even if it is not yet created. 
	- Metaphysics: Depends on the method of creation. 
	- *Canonical examples include: [[Kenku]], [[Merfolk]], [[Centaurs]], [[Goblins]], [[Bullywugs]], and [[Kobolds]].* 
	- ***These should generally only be introduced carefully and for specific reasons.***

6. **Natives of other Planes**. The Feywild and the Elemental Planes are well-developed concepts, which have also spawned native inhabitants. The details of exactly how these natives are created is not developed at all. Any inner plane can reasonably have native inhabitants. 

%% this is a bit thin, although the basic existence and types of fey and elementals are well-established and easy to parse, their metaphysics are a bit of a black box beyond the idea the likely accrete soulstuff instead of being endowed with soulstuff by a Divinity. The flavor of archfey is definitely not divine, nor is the flavor of things like Gazankoa, so probably there is no aspect ehre of "accreting so much soulstuff you become divine" as may be the case (but is not necessarily the case) for category 3 above. %%

7. **Beasts and Monstrosities**. Many creatures, ranging from animals of limited intelligence to sapient and terrifying monsters of legend, populate the world of Taelgar. These diverse creatures that populate the land typically have diverse and usually undeveloped creation stories, and might have arisen from any number of sources. However, three fundamental properties distinguish these species from other creatures on Taelgar. First, creatures in this category accrete soulstuff by virture of their sentience, not by virtue of a divine gift. Second, creatures in this category came into existence during or after the Riving. Third, creatures in this category do not have extensive culture, religion, or language, though they may have intelligence and the capacity to speak a language, whether magically or naturally. 

8. **Magical Species**. Some creatures are explicitly the creation of magical experiments, interventions, or rituals. These also may be diverse creatures of various kinds, and might have arise from any number of sources. However, they also share a few key properties. Most importantly, these creatures are the creations of magic, and mimic the innate awareness of most creatures with magic, and thus typically do not attract or accrete soulstuff. Mindless undead, constructs, and some other magical creations would typically fall into this category. 

%% the general idea behind 7 and 8 is that they would typically not have a creator, at least not in any meaningful cultural sense. In some cases monstrosities are just natural creatures with strange abilities due to exposure to magic;  these strange abilities might manifest as unusually high intelligence. fundamentally, though, these species don't have an "origin story". maybe every now and then giant snakes will give birth to basilisks if they lay their eggs too close to an extraplanar weak point for example -- there is no one "basilisk" origin story or assumption that all basilisks are the "same". the distinction between the two is really about intentionality - 7 is just kind of generic default of the world; 8 is when this process is carried out by a specific creature. but the vibe here is not "I created a magical species" (that would probably be 4) but rather "this ritual produced an iron golem; someone else could do the same ritual and produce a different iron golem" %%

#### ***Notes and Open Questions***

- Elder Folk - is this an in-world term or a meta term? I lean the latter, but this needs some invention as it is a useful category to have. 
- Goblinoids - see [[Goblinoids]] for discussion. This needs consideration. What best matches facts on the ground based on how these species have been portrayed in game is to move goblins to "Unusual Species", stop considering bugbears a separate "species" (they are probably a subset of fey), and leave only hobgoblins as the Void Mind counterpart to humans. 
- Echos of the Riving needs more thought, and probably doesn't really make sense as a category, given the various changing metaphysics of the Primordial Cosmos and the Riving itself. We've moved strongly away from "pre-Riving the world was occupied by great wyrms, titans, elder elementals, and archfey" for good reasons but the species lore hasn't fully caught up. In particular, it seems likely that Fey and Elementals should be separated out, as natives of specific planes that aren't the Material Plane, while giants and dragons are more complex. I have started a rewrite above. Removed Echoes of the Riving but text is here in case it is useful for now:

>	**Echoes of the Riving**. In the timeless age before the Riving, various powerful beings of infused with magical energy shaped and reshaped reality around them. When the Multiverse was created during the Riving, the echoes of that event rippled and transformed and spread, and in the process spawned sentient beings, infused with [[Soulstuff]]. Dragons, giants, fey, and elementals all trace their origins to this event. *Canonically includes: [[Fey]], [[Dragons]], [[Elementals]], [[Giants]]*. ***New classes of species in this category need compelling justification, but new variants of the four existing species are relatively easy to introduce.

- Undead might need special consideration apart from "Corrupted Species", though the general vibe of corrupted species is, I think, correct. For now I have just linked out to the undead page to host discussion. 
- I think the metaphysics of soulstuff implied on this page are wrong, and I'm not sure the distinction between "souled" and "soulless" is useful metaphysically, and I think it poses serious difficulties for game play. E.g., there are all kinds of strange creatures that are fun to use (e.g., giant eagles, or awakened trees, or manticores, or harpies, or whatever) that are sentient and intelligent, but aren't "species" in the above typology. Having to decide what the implications of these types of creatures not having "souls" complicates things in my mind, and pushes to introduce more species with specific creation stories. Instead I think it is better to consider soulstuff as something that accretes to thinking creatures, rather than the reverse. So "thinking" on the material plane (or the feywild, or the elemental planes, or any inner plane) drags soulstuff towards you creating an echo on the plane of consciousness. This also short circuits questions about whether fey have souls - fey might not have religion or gods, but they do have souls. 
- Note that per above, the only creatures that would not have any kind of soul (beyond things like bacteria and plants that are not sentient) are a subset of undead, most constructs, and potentially some of the "magical creatures" category that are explicitly animated by magic itself and not actually sentient. 
- We have given minimal thought to how natives of the inner planes that are not the material plane come into existence. I'm not sure this needs a lot of thought right now, but flagging for consideration. 

### Natives of the Outer Realms

These have well-defined typologies but within the existing typologies can be fairly straightforwardly created. Need to have a home plane.

9. **Children of Creation**. Any creature or species that arises directly from [[Soulstuff]] and is native to the [[Outer Realms]] fits in this category. Classic examples include fiends and celestials. A fundamental aspect of these creatures and species is that they cannot be killed on the material plane: if they are defeated in the [[Inner Realms]], they simply dissipate and reform on their native plane. Note [[Gidari]] are included here although the [[Land of the Dead]] is not clearly classified by canonical sources and subject to extensive in-world debate. 
10. **Divinities**. Any creature that is a pure representation of the energy of the [[Plane of Creation]] can be considered a divinity. Divinities -- which include the [[Embodied Gods]] and the [[Incorporeal Gods]], as well as creatures such as the [[Tanshi]] and the [[Kestavo]] -- are distinct from the Children of Creation primarily in terms of their power. Left undetermined is whether powerful archdevils and demon lords and the like are more akin to Divinities or Children of Creation. 

### Natives of the Far Realms

11. **Alien Species**. There are many things flung across the universe that are older, and stranger, than the world of Taelgar. Many aberrations, and especially mind flayers, are ultimately invaders from these [[Far Realms]], and many of these invaders created twisted creations to be their slaves, prey, or entertainment, some of whom still linger in the world. While at the moment, the only canonical invaders to Taelgar are from ancient and disturbing [[Far Realms]], some races and creatures that are traditionally associated with Spelljammer in D&D could have an origin via this mechanism, or via a similar “transport from other timelines” type mechanism. *Canonical examples: [[Ithilids]], beholders, aboleths, [[Sentient Ocean]]*. ***Most typical D&D aberrations fit easily into this category, although some care should be given to avoiding too much of a Spelljammer vibe.***

## Decision Tree for Adding New Races

Is the creature part of a civilization with a history, culture, religious beliefs, language, diversity of thought and opinion? 

- No: You are likely looking 7, 8, or maybe 4; the choice depends largely on lore and fit. In general, the default should likely be 7, unless there is a good reason. Category 8 implies an obviously magical origin story, and typically should be used for constructs and the like.  Category 4 implies a source type of another category that was corrupted. Category 7 is a good catch-all for anything that has sapience but not culture. Examples: medusa is likely 4, basilisk is likely 7, and gorgon is likely 8. 
- Yes, and native to the material plane: 
	- If created by an embodied god, or a variant of such a species: 1 (**rare**: be cautious about introducing new embodied gods or variants of "elder folk" without very good reason)
	- If created directly by a high god (Divine Presence or Void Mind): 2 (**very rare**: most likely this category should be restricted to humans and hobgoblins and any addition beyond that needs extensive discussion)
	- If it can be tied to dragons or giants: 3 is an easy fit
	- If related to mind flayers or other aberrations, to various manipulations of the void mind, or other kinds of corruptions or curses: 4 is an easy fit.
- Yes, but native to something that isn't the material plane:
	- Comes from an inner realm: 6 (note that while fey and elementals can freely be invented and extended, additional inner planes beyond the Feywild and the Elemental Realms should be given some thought)
	- Comes from the outer realms: 9
	- Comes from a far realm: 11

If there is not an obvious choice: is it a major part of a campaign (current or past) that, for plot/story reasons, needs a complex culture and backstory?

- Consider whether it could be a Void Mind trick in an existing metaphysical category, e.g. an "evil" myconoid species or insect species, corrupted, awakened by an agent of the void mind, or a "slave species" corrupted by a Far Realm power. Many of these creatures could fit in 4. 
- Consider whether it could be native to a yet-undescribed Far Realm, potentially with a radically different vibe than typical [[Far Realms]], in which case consider 11.
- Consider whether it could represent a extraplanar entity possessing and twisting something native to the Material Plane, in which case 9 could fit. For example, gnolls, who are fiends (demons) substantiated into the bodies of carnivores on the material plane, would fit in this category. Should, in this case, typically be created, not born. 
- Consider whether this might be an exceptional case where a beast/monstrosity (category 7) has extensive culture, perhaps from a dominant group that spread or evolved (though note the history of the world is a bit short for extensive evolution), or a powerful magic user succeeded in creating a new species (category 8). Likely, in this case, to require special/extenuating circumstances and likely some strong connection to some kind of magic. Note that this could be the "not evil" counterpart to category 4 in some cases, if that is needed. 
- If nothing else fits, consider 5, 3, or a new inner realm and 6:
	- If the species has a vibe of diverse power levels, strong connections to magic, and the potential to have ancient and extremely powerful members, and the species potentially has a very long history on Taelgar and the material plane, but cannot be tied to dragons or giants:  a new category of 3 could fit
	- If the species fits well with an idea for a new type of inner plane: a new category of 6 could fit
	- Otherwise: consider 5, which will likely be the easiest option in most cases

### Key Distinctions of Choices

- Playable races should pretty exclusively be 1, 2, or 5, plus fey (6), though not all species in any of these categories need be playable. 

- Creatures from 1-7 and some creatures in 8 generally have souls that, when they die go to the Land of the Dead, although whether they pass beyond to anything is not always clear.  Resurrection magic works per the usual Taelgar metaphysics. Most creatures in 8, and some in 4, simply cease to exist when they are killed, and cannot be resurrected by normal means. Creatures from 9-10 dissipate and reappear on their native plane if killed on the material plane. Creatures from 11 can have any weird or unusual metaphysics desired, although often they would be expected to accrete soulstuff like creatures in 1-7. 

- Creatures from 1-3 are intended to have origin stories that fit a type:
	- Creatures from 1 are created by embodied gods, which should be rare and individual. Even variants/off-shoots of these should be introduced very cautiously
	- Creatures from 2 are intended to be exclusively humans and hobgoblins. Additions here require very careful thought and a compelling motivation
	- Creatures from 3 are intended to capture species that are (a) not clearly associated with a non-material plane, (b) can potentially have god-like power, but (c) are not simply unique creations, and (d) have unique shared vibes. While generally it is simple to introduce new **variants** of these species (e.g., a new flavor of dragon or giant), adding new entire types here requires careful thought and a clear motivation.

- Creatures from 5 are a catch-all for true species with a single origin that does not fit 1-4. New things should be added fairly cautiously here.

- Creatures from 4, 7, and 8 are a good catch-all category for supernatural villains. Lean towards 4 for intelligence species with either (a) a clear connection to the Void Mind somehow (e.g., undead via Umidzka, lycanthropes via Jinnik), or (b) a persistent culture, language, etc. Lean towards 7 for isolated creatures that wouldn't be thought of as having a culture and society. Lean towards 8 for creatures specifically created by magic (constructs in particular typically fit here). 

- Creatures from 6 are defined by having typical "material plane" metaphysics (they accrete soulstuff and can die outside their native plane) but being native to a specific non-material plane. Adding a new type to this category requires inventing a plane for it to be native to. 

- Creatures from 9 and 10 are *made* of soulstuff and vanish to their native plane when killed; they cannot be permanently destroyed except on their home plane. This is the catch-all category for natives of the outer planes. 
 
- Creatures from 3 and 6 are generally distinguished by having no obvious gods or afterlife, despite potentially having a culture and single origin stories, though note the possibility of "religion" among members of 3 associated with worshipping "ascended" ancestors of their own kind. Creatures that otherwise might fit here, that are intended to have religions and gods, will often be a better fit to 5, unless they are corruptions of the Void Mind (4).

- Creatures from 11 should also not be native to the material plane, but are not from extraplanar realms, at least not ones created by human beliefs. This can be a pretty generic catch-all category for things that come from elsewhere, don’t have a Taelgar specific story, but are useful/interesting for a plot. Twisted creations of mind flayers and aboleths (in particular) would typically be 4, not 11, unless they were "brought over" from the far realm. 

### Notes on Creature Types in D&D

D&D creature types do not perfectly map to these categories, but generally this should not matter as creature types do not have rules themselves. General guidelines for translating creature-type rules to Taelgar:

- Anything that references Humanoids should generally be interpreted as referencing categories 1 and 2, although some species in 5 may possibly be considered humanoids. 
- Anything that references "Celestials, Fiends, Fey, Elementals" should be interpreted as referencing natives of other planes, specifically 6 and 9. 
- Anything that references "Aberrations" should be interpreted as referencing 11, although some creatures in 4 may possibly be considered aberrations. 
- Anything that references "Constructs" should be interpreted to reference creatures in category 8 that are defined as Constructs on their statblock. This would typically exclude things that are actually extraplanar natives but are defined on their statblock as Constructs. 
- There is no metaphysical or in-world reason to treat game effects that reference Beasts different than the standard rules, as Beasts retain the same meaning as in standard D&D and can reference statblocks, not metaphyiscs. Beasts are metaphysically simply a subset of the large category 7. 
- There is no metaphysical or in-world reason to treat game effects that reference Undead differently than the standard rules, as Undead retains the same meaning as in standard D&D and can reference statblocks, not metaphysics. Undead are metaphysically typically in category 4, but some might also be considered category 8 (e.g., if created by Animate Dead or similar magic). 
- Dragons, Giants, Plants, Oozes, and Monstrosities can generally just be interpreted based on standard rules. 


See the [[Creatures of Taelgar]] section for how this plays out.


%% discord notes, to think about

working a little more on and off in 20 minute chunks between meetings. one fundamental rework that i am contemplating is making a major distinction between what I might call "single origin" species and "multiple origin" species. i'm not sure what good terminology is, or if we need good terminology. but i think the distinction solves a lot of issues in that it makes it possible to have a diversity of creatures while keeping the worldbuliding implications contained. the fundamental distinction is: a single origin species is a creature that has a single origin and a unique creation story. every single extant member of that species either arose at that time of creation, or descends from a creature that existed at that time. i think this has key implications, in that a single origin species has cultural continuity and room for cultural evolution. a multiple origin species, in contrast, can at least potentially be created repeated. undead would be the classic example, in that undead cannot reproduce so they can only be created by repeated origins. but i think this also fits for tons of other sapient monsters and allies - medusa, minotaurs, gnolls, giant eagles, lycanthropes, and many others all make the most sense as creatures that can be at least occasionally created, and in some cases can only arise through creation. my default would be to assume that most sapient magical creatures fall into the second category. taelgar is a magical world and things happen. but just because you met a minotaur doesn't imply in comes from a long line of minotaurs going back thousands of years to a long-ago minotaur ancestor who was created in a specific describable moment.

i still haven't quite locked in the terminology, and i'm less certain what to do with natives of other planes, e.g. does this make sense as a distinction for elementals too? or fey? i can kind of see it making sense there too, in the sense that say djinn have culture and continuity whereas air elementals don't and can just be created from the fundamental esssence of the plane

but it is harder to sort out outside the material plane because we don't have a good idea how non-material-plane natives are created
  
(well i guess specifically fey and elementals - outer planes natives are maybe a little clearer in some ways)

anyway have to jump on a call in a few minutes but might continue to work a little on updates to obsidian to reflect this if i don't really need to listen. but likely won't have bandwidth to reply to any thoughts until 4 pm or so
