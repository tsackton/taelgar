# Creature Rules in Taelgar

This page is contains guidelines for adapting D&D rules around creatures to Taelgar metaphysics. For background on the metaphysics of creatures, see [[Metaphysics of Creatures]]. For mechanical details of species available to PCs, see [[Playable Species of Taelgar]].

## Categories of Creatures

There are four broad categories of creatures that exist in Taelgarian metaphysics, elaborated on in more detail in [[Metaphysics of Creatures]]. Except as noted, all these creatures, by the nature of their subjective perceptions, attract and accrete [[Soulstuff]], linking them to the [[Plane of Souls]]. This 

* **Creatures**: these are sentient natives of one of the many planes in the multiverse; unlike species, they are not expected to have a single unique origin story or shared history. The trolls that one adventuring party fights in the Plaguelands might be metaphysically unrelated to the trolls another party fights in the Blackwater Fens. Note there are important subsets of creatures based on plane of origin. Creatures might have pages on ecology and tendencies. 
* **Species**: these are creatures with a unique culture and language, and continuity across the world. There might be many different human, dragon, or kenku cultures, but they share an evolution, common history, and overarching narrative. Everything  in this category should have a single origin story for how it came to be and spread across the world, even though that origin story may not have been invented yet. Natives of any Inner Plane, or the Far Realms, can be species. Natives of Spiritual Realms 
* **Constructs**: these are sentient creatures that are not really thinking creatures at all, but are animated by some magic which mimics sentience. They do not have souls at all and are rendered inanimate when killed, unless some magic restores them.
* **Transformations**: these are sentient creatures that were once members of a species, or a different creature, but have been transformed, either during life or after death, into some new form. This category covers a diverse array of possible things, from undead to lycanthropes to twisted/monstrous corruptions of species into new things. The key distinction is that transformations are defined by a process of creation, such as the curse of lycanthropy or the animate dead spell, and thus fundamentally cannot have a single origin story. A transformation that arose once at a specific point in history, and now only exists as descendants of that original event, might be better classified as a species, but generally this should be avoided unless important for story reasons. 

A fifth broad category, **divinities** exists, which define creatures that have accreted so much soulstuff (via their own powerful essence or a gift from elsewhere) that they have transcended any usual concept of mortality. They have various creation/origin stories, but typically each arise as unique individuals in unique circumstances, and are largely represented by notes in the `God and Religion` directory instead of the `Creatures` directory. Note that there are at least four broad categories of divinities -- High Gods, Embodied Gods, Incorporeal Gods, and "Demigods" -- which are not well defined metaphysically but not discussed further here. 

## Introducing New Creatures to Taelgar

Any D&D monster or playable species, or any wild idea anyone has, can potentially fit into Taelgar in some way, though not everything will. The following outlines the general questions that need to be resolved to place a creature into Taelgarian metaphysics. Any sentient being introduced to Taelgar should be considered a creature by default. 

### Is It a Species?

New species should be introduced cautiously, as species need to have a place in lore in a way that creatures, constructs, and transformations don't. It is easier to promote a creature to a species later than the reverse, so until there is some in-game lore generated and canonical experience with a species, it is best not to rush. An exception is if species lore and backstory is needed for development of a campaign or campaign arc (e.g., a campaign arc around attacking a mind flayer slave camp in the Underdark might require decisions about whether mind flayers are species or creatures native to the Far Realms).

To introduce a species requires, minimally, a sense of their origin story and historical development, though these do not need to be extensively detailed. Some idea about their metaphysics, souls, and religion are useful as well. 

#### Origin Story

A central thing that makes a species a species is their unique origin story. So far, there are three relatively well developed classes of origin stories, and then three catch-all categories. Carefully consider what kind of origin story makes sense for a new species. 

**Children of the Embodied Gods:** These are species that were directly created by one of the [[Embodied Gods]], a unique category of divine being endowed with a physical manifestation by the [[Divine Presence]] (though note the exact metaphysics of what determines whether something is an Embodied God vs Incorporeal God vs High God is not fully developed). Species with this origin story should have unique magical abilities granted by their connection to their divine creator. Metaphysically, this is represented by these species receiving a gift of soulstuff from their divine creators, which gives them power; upon death this soulstuff is assumed to pass into the beyond to be reclaimed and rejoin these divinities, whatever that might mean. The term "Firstborn" is often used to refer to the creator god or gods of a given species in this category. 

Canonically includes:  [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk]], [[Halflings]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Orcs]]
New creations in this category need compelling justification, and significant world building to integrate into existing history. New creations in this category also need to be tied to a new Embodied God. It is assumed that each Embodied God creates only a single species. 

Notes: 
- Historically species in this category have been assumed to have more fixed cultural traits than other species, and to have fixed languages that do not change over time and drift into new languages. Several of these species are canonically much more long-lived than humans, and this can introduce unusual biology. 
- There is unlikely to be space for new inventions in this category, except potentially around new embodied gods created by the Void Mind; e.g., potentially some "evil" species could exist that was largely wiped out during the Downfall and now only has a presence in strange lands to the south, or something like that. 

**Direct Creations of a High God:** These species are those that were directly and intentionally created by a High God, either the [[Divine Presence]] or the [[Void Mind]]. These species are unique in their categories and it is likely that no new invention in this category is possible. The specific details of human and hobgoblin creation stories are covered elsewhere. Humans, unlike any other known species on Taelgar, are the direct creations of the Divine Presence breathing the essence of creation, the divine spark, into material form. Metaphysically, [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] are also in this category, though they are the spawn of the [[Void Mind]], acting in secret to steal and twist the power of the [[Divine Presence]]. Humans and hobgoblins both have unique metaphysics and details of their souls. 

Canonically includes: [[Humans]], [[Hobgoblins]]. 
New creations in this category are probably not possible. 

Notes: 
- In some way, the direct creation of humans is tied to the [[Divine Spark]] and a variety of concepts around [[Incorporeal Gods]], though this is not fully developed and many ideas are not fully canonical. 
- [[Hobgoblins]] are canonically associated with anti-soulstuff or at least the absence of soulstuff.
- See: [[Historical Framework]] and [[Historical Framework - Open Questions]] for more about humans and hobgoblins

**Echoes of Ancient Powers:** These species have some origin story connected, in a vague or loose way at least, with the events prior to the [[Riving]] and with entities that existed in some form or another during the [[Primordial Cosmos]]. The origin story of these species is often poorly developed; however, there should be a strong sense of powerful magic for any species in this category, which should be reserved for species that at least potentially can be extraordinarily powerful. There are no real canonical details about the metaphysics of creatures in this category, except that typically these species should be defined by an ability to accrete very large amounts of soulstuff, but they should not receive gifted soulstuff from divine realms. 

Canonically includes: [[Dragons]], [[Giants]]
New types of giants and dragons are relatively safe to invent, though keep in mind the need for a shared history and origin story. Creatures like ogres, cyclops, and wyverns are likely better treated as "creatures" or "transformations". New species in this category require some thought, primarily to avoid overloading the world with too many extremely powerful creatures. 

Notes:
- These species arose not from a creator god, but from some kind of power and ancient magic of creation. Given their potentially great power and long life, many of the strongest of these creatures accrete large amounts of soulstuff, and there is the potential for deity-like entities or even true Divinities to have arisen out of the strongest of these creatures.
- There is a vibe, though not canonically developed, that these species generally don't have religion. If they do have religion, they likely worship ascended members of their own species, who accreted sufficient soulstuff to function like divinities, but are not related in any real metaphysical way to the [[Divine Presence]] or even necessarily the [[Spiritual Realms]]. 
- This is really intended to be a category for powerful and intelligent species that clearly need a culture but don't fit as natives of other planes; the unifying feature here is really the potential to accrete very large amounts of soulstuff and reach high CR. 
- From Tim: I am committed to the idea that dragons and giants are somehow echoes or representatives or creations or something of pre-Riving powers, but the exact details should probably be left intentionally hazy. This does not have to involve the Divine Presence - they could be magic made flesh or something, created out of the Plane of Magic somehow, for example. 
- Vibe from older notes: " Once, in the ancient days before the [[Riving]], when the multiverse was young and magic was strong, great powers walked the earth, reshaping it on a whim. Though few know the ultimate fate of these powers, or whether any still live today, folklore claims that the [[Giants|giants]] and [[Dragons|dragons]] trace their origins to the [[Primordial Cosmos]] in some fashion."

**Transformed Species:** Some species might fit best with an origin story that involves a unique split or transformation from another species with different origin story. There are no canonical examples of this that have been invented, although brainstorming around gnomes suggests they are the sundered surface cousins of dwarves. Generally, these species need a unique transformative event in their history. This should be used sparingly - most transformations do not need to be species. Metaphysically, these species will usually inherit the metaphysics of their original species prior to the transformation, unless the transformative event specifically changed the nature of their souls, which could be possible. 

Canonically includes: nothing
Tentatively includes: [[Gnomes]]

Notes:
- This is a pretty loose category that does not have much invention behind it yet, but could be useful. 

**Other Species:** A catch-all category for everything that doesn't fit into the above categories. This is generally either species with a unique and hard-to-categorize creation story, or species with no creation story invented yet but which do not obviously fit into another category. The metaphysics of these species depends on their creation story and might vary widely. 

Canonically includes: [[Kenku]], [[Merfolk]], [[Centaurs]]
Currently also includes:  [[Goblins]], [[Kobolds]], [[Fae]], [[Fairies]]
Possibly also includes: [[Ithilids]], [[Bullywugs]], [[Dragonets]], [[Djinn]], [[Azer]], [[Efreeti]], [[Dao]], [[Marid]], [[Aboleths]]

Notes:
- Many of the species in this category simply have no origin story or metaphysics invented, and some might not even be species. They are likely in the "unique" category, but might not be. These include:
	- Fae, Fairies - natives of the Feywild; definitely species but origin story very unclear
	- Goblins - almost certainly a species but origin story very unclear; could, for example, be transformations of hobgoblins somehow granted the ability to accrete soulstuff
	- Kobolds - definitely a species and very likely in this category, but origin story not invented
	- Dragonets - might not be a species; if they are, might be transformations from dragons; if not, might just have a unique and interesting population on the circular island
	- Bullywugs - might not be a species; if they are, might be a transformation from something, most likely a non-species 
	- Djinn, Azer, Efreeti, Dao, Marid - natives of the elemental planes; very likely most/all of these are species, but details of how elemental planes natives arise is unclear. Could be echoes of ancient powers, for example; in an earlier conception of deep history the "elder elementals" were part of the primordial cosmos. 
	- Aboleths, Ithilids - invaders from Far Realms; might not even be species
- Only kenku, centaurs, and merfolk have enough invented about their origin to canonically be in this category

#### Metaphysics of Souls

The other thing that must be considered for a species is the metaphysics of its soul, and how it accretes soulstuff. There are three broad categories here, loosely tied to the origin story. 

**Gifted Soulstuff**: Many species, including all the children of embodied gods and humans, are gifted soulstuff by a divinity upon birth. Species with this metaphysics are the only species whose souls travel beyond the Land of the Death to join divinities in the Spiritual Realms after death. Generally requires religion and a close relationship with gods for this metaphysics to work, though not all metaphysical details of this process are fully resolved. 

**Accrete Soulstuff**: This should generally be the default position in the absence of any more specific invention. Most species accrete soulstuff by their sentient nature. Because they are also sapient, that soulstuff persists for some time after death, but accreted soulstuff eventually returns to their native plane, to some undetermined fate which might be simply merging back with the ambient soulstuff of that plane, or might be something more complex, but should be distinct from the category above. 

**No Soulstuff:** Natives of the Far Realms generally won't accrete soulstuff, and so may not have a soul at all in the Taelgarian sense. Hobgoblins are special case, created to actively repel soulstuff; they also don't have Taelgarian souls. 

#### Native Plane

Species can be native to three different places. 

**Material Plane:** This is the most common answer, and should likely be the default unless it is obviously not appropriate. 
**Inner Planes**: Many species are native to the Feywild or one of the Elemental Planes. There probably aren't species native to other Inner Planes (such as the Plane of Magic, or postulated Positive/Negative Energy Realms), but technically their could be. Note that generally origin stories of species native to somewhere that is not the Material Plane don't exist yet, so there are some fuzzy details about creation here; it is especially unclear whether it is possible for natives of other planes to have gifted soulstuff, and if so what that might mean. 
**Far Realms**: Species that come from a specific Far Realm, and have a unique creation story in that Far Realm, and a unified history on Taelgar, also exist. Note that while many Far Realms in D&D are flavored as eldritch horrors, this does not have to be the case; see, for example, [[Merfolk]] and the [[Sentient Ocean]]. 

Note: species cannot be native to the Spiritual Realms. Natives of the Spiritual Realms are always creatures, with any culture and history tied to the plane they are from as much as them. In some sense, natives of the Spiritual Realms are simple extensions of the Spiritual Realms themselves. 

### Is It a Construct?

Constructs, in Taelgarian metaphysics, are creatures that mimic sentience and sapience if relevant by magic, and thus have no souls and do not accrete soulstuff. These are creatures that are explicitly the creation of magical experiments, interventions, or rituals, though they may be diverse creatures of various kinds, and might have arise from any number of sources. Anything created by any kind of magic in some way can potentially be a construct; this need not be tied to the Construct creature type in D&D. 

The concept of a native plane is generally meaningless for constructs, which have no soul anyway. 

Examples include:
- Golems, created by magical rituals
- Animated items, including the creations of the Animate Objects spell or similar magical effects
- Mindless undead created by Animate Dead or similar magic applied to a dead body are metaphysically constructs, as they have no soul and don't accrete soulstuff

Generally little or no invention is necessary to introduce a creature as a construct, although some idea about the way it was created might sometimes inform worldbuilding and mechanics. 

### Is It a Transformation?

Transformations, in Taelgarian metaphysics, are creatures that are transformations of other creatures, often, but not always, by some kind of curse or corruption, especially by agents of the [[Void Mind]]. Typically, this category is most useful for transformations of species into something else, or for common processes that can be applied widely; while metaphysically transformations from a creature are possible there is generally not much point in developing the metaphysics. 

Transformations retain the original metaphysics of the source creature, including their native plane, although in some cases the transformation process may change their metaphysics, particularly if, for example, a divine connection is severed. 

Examples of common transformations include:
- Lycanthropy is a curse of [[Jinnik]] that can turn members of some or all species into lycanthropes. In this case, they retain their original metaphysics, and can be cured. 
- The incorporeal undead are created when souls remain intact after the body has died, and do not pass on or fade. 
- Medusas, by traditional lore, are cursed sapient species, although nothing canonical has been created in Taelgar. 

Examples of transformed species include:
- [[Derro]], introduced during the Raven's Hold arc of the Dunmari Frontier campaign, are corrupted versions of dwarves, created by mind flayers, though exactly how was never determined, it likely involved severing their connection to the [[Bahrazel]]. 
- A variety of bipedal monstrosities in D&D most likely work best as transformations/corruptions of other species or perhaps creatures, although there is little canon lore developed here. 

Generally little or no world building is required to introduce a new transformation, although broad categories of transformations (like lycanthropy and undead) should be considered carefully before adding too many layers and complexities to the world. 

### Is It a Divinity?
Metaphysically, a divinity is just a creature that has accumulated enough soulstuff to escape typical mortality. While the most obvious category of divinity are the deities associated with worship, this is not the only kind of divinity. In particular, it is worth considering whether a creature that has a name and a unique history, and is intended to be functionally immortal, might be better described as a divinity. Humans who transcended normal mortality, such as Beryl and Bhishma, are also examples of divinities. 

Note: we might need a better name for this, to avoid confusion. It is a useful metaphysical category for things like archfey, but I think we want to avoid calling these "divinities". Extraplanar powers is currently used for roughly this category, and might work. 

### Where Is It From?
Anything that is not a species, construct, or transformation is, by definition, a creature (unless it is a unique and extremely powerful individual, in which case it might be a divinity). For creatures, by far the most important distinction is their native plane. There are roughly five options here. 

(1) **The Material Plane**: the simplest option, and the best default. Unless there is a good reason to decide otherwise, most typical monsters should be considered creatures native to the material plane. 
(2) **The Feywild**: the Feywild has a very distinctive vibe, and mostly it is obvious whether a potential creature is a fey or not. The more complicated decision is whether is a member of one of the two species native to the Feywild ([[Fairies]] and the [[Fae]]), or whether it is a creature. Both fairies and fae have some specific vibes, but unlike species native to the material plane come in a wide range of diverse forms. Most obviously, place based creatures like dryads should be considered creatures, not species, but there is a lot of flexibility here. 
(3) **Elemental Planes**: anything native to one of the Elemental Planes must tie to the elemental vibe of its native plane. Otherwise, though, these are pretty flexible and there is minimal canon here. Some very powerful elementals, like kraken or phoenixes, might be more akin to divinities. 
(4) **The Spiritual Realms**: native of the Spiritual Realms are special, in that they are made purely of soulstuff and manifest bodies when they travel to the inner planes, but cannot be killed except on their native plane. It should generally be obvious when this is an appropriate choice. Natives of Spiritual Realms should be thought of an extensions of their native plane. 
(5) **The Far Realms**: natives of the Far Realms canonically should have non-Taelgarian metaphysics, but can depart widely from the traditional eldritch horror vibe. 

## General Guidelines

The default for any new thing should generally be a creature native to the material plane, as this is widely flexible and can account for many diverse things. 

Creatures that are not native to the Material Plane are often obvious:
- Natives of Spiritual Realms should be obvious extensions of that plane. Keep in mind these creatures cannot be killed outside their native plane. Consider also this category for creatures that are strongly connected to another plane: for example, gnolls are best considered natives of the Abyss, created by possession of a carnivore, usually a scavenger such as a hyena, by a demonic entity (though these could also be considered transformations). These creatures can never be species. 
- Natives of the Feywild have a very distinctive vibe. Note, however, there are good reasons to avoid inventing any new species native to the Feywild. Most new creatures that integrate with the politics of the Feywild and might otherwise fit the definition of species should usually instead be considered variants of one of the two existing species ([[Fae]] and [[Fairies]]). Feywild species are very malleable in form and abilities. However, many fey can also be considered creatures, not species. Anything strongly tied to a place, such as nymphs and dryads, as well as manifestations of emotions, are likely creatures, not species. 
- Natives of one of the elemental planes should have obvious connections to their home plane in mechanics and description. There is a lot of room for invention here, as the elemental planes are relatively lightly detailed. New species are possible. 
- Natives of the Far Realms are often, but not always, associated with horror content and aberrations, but note there are canonically many Far Realms and these can have radically different vibes if desired. Only introduce new Far Realms species if really needed to create a culture and history. 

Species native to the Material Plane or the Feywild are a fairly complete category. Any new invention here needs to fit in with extensive canon and world development, which will often only be possible if they have very restricted settlement patterns or other features that lead to limited influence on canonical history, politics, and culture. 

The distinction between creatures, transformations, and constructs is often arbitrary and can potentially be made based on vibes. This is generally not worth over-thinking, though consider transformation if obviously related to an existing species or has a vibe of cursed/corrupted. 

Even if a creature is intended to have culture, language, and history, consider whether this might be an exceptional case where a creature has extensive culture, perhaps from a dominant group that spread or evolved (though note the history of the world is a bit short for extensive evolution), or a powerful magic user succeeded in creating something new. A key distinction here is that in this case, one might expect to encounter related creatures that seem similar but with radically different metaphysics and history. Dragonets are a possible example here, as are bullywugs. 

Generally, most things can be shoehorned into the generic creature category if needed, even potentially playable species for a player who really wants something specific. The assumption should be to lean away from species creation until needed. 

In most cases, standard monsters don't need lore invention to use and can be assumed to exist in one of the standard non-species categories. 

## D&D Creature Types

D&D creature types do not perfectly map to these categories, but generally this should not matter as creature types do not have rules themselves. General guidelines for translating creature-type rules to Taelgar:

### Common Groupings

Often D&D rules use groupings of creature types to convey particular ideas. These can often be translated to Taelgar metaphysics. 

- Anything that references "Celestials, Fiends, Fey, Elementals" as a class should be interpreted as referencing any creature or species not native to the Material Plane, excluding natives of the Far Realms. 
- Anything that references "Celestials, Fiends, Fey, Elementals, Aberrations" as a class should be interpreted as referencing any creature or species not native to the Material Plane, including natives of the Far Realms. 
- Anything that references "Constructs and Undead" as a class is usually hinting at the idea of "doesn't have a soul", and should generally be interpreted to refer to constructs (which includes mindless undead) and natives of the Far Realms. 
- Anything that references "Celestials and Fiends" as a class should generally be interpreted to reference to natives of the Spiritual Realms. 

### Individual Types

- Anything that references Humanoids should generally be interpreted as referencing species native to the material plane.
- Anything that references Constructs should generally be interpreted as referencing creatures that lack a soul and are defined as Constructs on their statblock. This would typically exclude things that are actually extraplanar natives but are defined on their statblock as Constructs, as well as mindless undead. 
- Anything that references Fiends should generally be associated with non-Divine Spiritual Realms, or just demons + devils, depending on context. 
- There is no metaphysical or in-world reason to treat game effects that reference Beasts different than the standard rules, as Beasts retain the same meaning as in standard D&D and can reference statblocks, not metaphyiscs. Beasts are metaphysically simply a subset of the large category of creatures native to the material plane. 
- Though undead are metaphysically complex given the variety of ways they can arise, for various reasons it is likely best to rely on the statblock, not Taelgarian metaphysics, here. Generally anything that is a transformation of a once-living creature fits here.
- Plants, Oozes, and Monstrosities can generally just be interpreted based on standard rules. 
- Dragons and Giants should generally be restricted to members of the Giant or Dragon species, potentially including transformations of those species. 

## Resurrection Magic

Creature metaphysics has a specific impact on resurrection magic. Soulstuff is the medium by which the essence of a creature is maintained after death, so resurrection is generally only possible while the soulstuff of a creature has some independent existence. This means that creatures that do not have a soul generally cannot be resurrected, and that normally once the soulstuff of a creature has ceased to exist as a coherent entity, resurrection is no longer possible. 

In D&D, this plays out as follows:

- _Revivify_ can bring back any dead creature that had a soul in life, but whose soul has not faded from the Plane of Souls, which usually happens quickly after death and explains the 1 minute limitation. This includes all creatures with soulstuff, no matter the source, and generally should not work for creatures without souls. It is possible that hobgoblins could be an exception to this rule; constructs should never be able to be affected by any resurrection magic, even revivify. 
- _Raise Dead_, _Reincarnate_, and other spells that have a 10 day limit can retrieve a soul that has left the Material Plane, but has not yet reached its final resting place, whatever that might be. For species with soulstuff gifted by divinities, this typically would represent the time of the journey across the Land of the Dead. For species that accrete soulstuff, and who presumably don't pass into the Land of the Dead (or at least not the one connected to embodied and incorporeal gods), these spells should still work, but the time limit may vary depending on the exact metaphysics of the creature in question. 
- _Resurrection_ can bring back the soul of a dead creature that has reached its final resting place, as long as it still exists as some coherent, individual entity. In current metaphysics, this means that Resurrection only works on species whose soulstuff is gifted by divinities, as these are the only creatures who souls pass through the Land of the Dead to the Divine Realms and continue to exist in some fashion there. 
- _True Resurrection_ or _Wish_ are 9th level spells and as such can upend the standard limits of metaphysics. These spells are the only ones even plausibly capable of resurrected a soul that has ceased to exist as a distinct entity, and even these spells may not always succeed at this.
