# Hobgoblins

For most people in the modern day, hobgoblins are associated with the thud of iron-shod boots marching in lockstep; perfect, disciplined ranks of pikes; the ashy burning smell of fire sorcerers in the aftermath of battle. They formed the backbone of the armies of Cha'mutte during the Great War, and in the years since have remained a significant and often implacable enemy of many human (and other) realms. News of hobgoblin armies brings terror to cities and towns, for stories speak of their grim habit of turning captured towns into brutal work-camps, or worse. Among priests, theologians, and theological cosmologists, it is claimed that hobgoblins have no soul, no connection to any of [[Divine Realms]], and indeed many suspect that they actively repel the [[Divine Presence]] and its creations. 

## Appearance

Hobgoblins are often large and imposing, tending to be slightly larger and more muscular than humans, though with a large variation. Most hobgoblins have prominent fangs, ears, and brow ridges, and many have short horns protruding from their upper foreheads. A variety of reddish skin tones, red or golden eyes, and black hair is common. 

%% There is likely wide variation here, but this is the tendency for images I've made, cf [[Revaka]] %%

## Language and Naming

Most hobgoblins speak a common creole, derived from the language of Cha'mutte's armies, that is called _katonylev_ (or "army tongue") by speakers, is typically referred to as simply Goblin by outsiders. Whether hobgoblins speak other languages amongst themselves is not known. 

%% possibly there are clan-tongues too, or even a complex language history like humans, but this (a) not canonical, and (b) probably too complicated to develop. %%


%%^Campaign:None%%

Katonylev is based on Hungarian, which is an Uralic language most closely related to Finnish. In general any kind of consonant heavy names that feel vaguely "harsh" likely work, but names that feel very obviously Slavic should probably be avoided. Other hobgoblin languages may have diverse real world mappings, and it is possible for names to be in languages other than Goblin or retain aspects of clan-tongues, providing an easy way to explain / contextualize diverse hobgoblin names if needed.

## Lifecycle

Little is known about hobgoblin reproduction, age of maturity, family life, or aging. Hobgoblins have a natural lifespan similar to humans. 

%% likely that hobgoblins mature quickly and also have very short old ages %%

## Settlements and Homelands

Since Cha'mutte's defeat in the [[Great War]], hobgoblins have gradually been pushed away from human realms, and now tend to occupy marginal land where they can, surviving at the margins of the [[Plaguelands]], in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], and the northern slopes of the [[Fiatara Mountains]]. 

%% no other details of hobgoblin settlements are invented, though see DM Notes below. no details about hobgoblin towns or cities are invented. %%

## Cultural Traits
Hobgoblin societies are organized around discipline and strict hierarchy, with hobgoblins inevitably seen as above all other species. Occupation of the realms of other species, when hobgoblins manage it, can be brutal, but hobgoblins are not mindlessly evil. While in some cases they will decimate towns or conscript large swaths of the population into bondage and slavery, those that surrender are often taxed and put to work instead. Hobgoblins are unusual among the species of Taelgar in their practice of slavery.

Whether hobgoblins have art, or music, or other creative endeavors is not known, though a small number of decorative arts, particularly martial items, are known. 

Hobgoblins have no religion, worship no gods, and have never been observed to use divine magic. 

%% Presumably they suppress religion in areas they rule, but not sure if this has ever been fully established. %%

## Historical Perspective

The history of hobgoblins prior to the Great War is poorly known, though many fought in the wars between the [[Dominion of Avatus]] and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Wisford]], [[Addermarch]], and others, and hobgoblins were a major threat in northern [[Dunmar]] and the [[Aurbez Plateau]] area in the years before the [[Great War]]. 

Much of the decades after the [[Great War]], however, were defined by hobgoblin wars, shaping the history of [[Sembara]], [[Dunmar]], the [[Chardonian Empire]], and more. In these years, hobgoblins often ruled human lands for a generation, or more, before being driven back. 

%% see: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]; at some point, some player-facing summaries of the Blood Years hobgoblin wars might be useful %%

## Details for DMs 

### Open Questions
- What is the nature of hobgoblin clans, exactly? Are these best thought of as nations, as armies, as something else? 
- How are clans lead? Several canonical clans span far greater lengths than is plausible for a single leader; presumably leadership various somewhat from group to group, but really no details are developed. 
- What are the impacts of hobgoblins unique metaphysics? Are hobgoblins strictly an "enemy species" or are neutral hobgoblins possible? How much of the current day attitude of hobgoblins is a consequence of the Great War and its aftermath? A possible aspect of this is slavery has been vaguely established as a uniquely hobgoblin institution. 

### Hobgoblins in Play
- While hobgoblins can potentially appear in any open unsettled space on the fringes of society, or in the wilderness, some care should be given to hobgoblin populations as they are typically organized and have purpose. A random orc horde can emerge from the hills and attack a town; a hobgoblin army doesn't just appear for no reason.
- A lot of detail about hobgoblin movements and locations in the years after the Great War is in [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]; this can be added to, but shouldn't be contradicted. 
- Known clans include:
	- [[Shattered Ice Clan]], held stretches of southern Sembara at times but was largely wiped out during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. Some remnants may exist on the fringes of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], particularly around the source of the [[Enst]] and west of [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], but possibly this group is completely destroyed. 
	- [[Blackened Claw]], entrenched near [[Raven's Hold]] and generally the northwestern part of the [[Nashtkar]] until destroyed in the [[Northern War]]. Likely extinct in the current day. 
	- [[Iron Fang]], involved early wars immediately after the end of the Great War in southern Sembara; pushed back deep in the [[Plaguelands]]; an [[Iron Fang]] army emerged to fight against the forces of Aurbez in 1749 but was defeated with the aid of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. Whether any Iron Fang remnants survive in the [[Plaguelands]] is unknown.
	- The Bitter Knife clan fought in the [[Bitter Knife War]] against Dunmar, but was defeated. Any survivors would likely be found in the [[Nashtkar]] or the western edge of the [[Plaguelands]]. These are potentially the source of postulated hobgoblin raiders around the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. 
	- [[Skullcleaver Clan]] controls a hobgoblin realm on northeastern [[Irrla]] and shifted to piracy during the 1730s, constrained by [[Republic of Svolhas|Svolhas]]. These were potentially not remnants of Cha'mutte's armies, and are not discussed in [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]
	- Several clans were involved in conflicts on the west coast in the years after the [[Great War]], but details have not been invented for the most part. It is plausible that remnants of these clans, or survivors of Pandar, exist on the west coast still. 
	- Small groups of hobgoblins exist north of [[Voltara]], but this may be a tiny group struggling to survive, rather than a full-fledged clan/army. 
- Canonically, Cha'mutte was able to recruit (whether voluntarily or by coercion) large numbers of the hobgoblins that lived in northwestern Taelgar to fight in the Great War, so the history of hobgoblins in this part of the world was radically reshaped. But hobgoblins in the eastern Green Sea, the edges of Apporia, or the south potentially were less affected by Cha'mutte and may be more diverse. 

### Tactics and Occupation
- Hobgoblins should be perceived as skilled and feared warriors; their lines rarely break under pressure and they are capable of winning against larger foes
- Hobgoblin batte wizards are common, often (but not always) rely on fire magic, and typically have mechanical abilities to allow their allies to be unaffected by their spells.
- Hobgoblin clerics do not exist; hobgoblins may have magical healing via alchemy or potions or similar, but never have divine magic.
- Hobgoblins are more authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindlessly brutal, and also have enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. They may slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are often taxed and allowed to escape with relatively little death. 
- For hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off; plausibly hobgoblins believe that lesser species naturally owe them the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product and there is no freedom of movement. But they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told.
- However this may vary from group to group, and at least some hobgoblin armies and clans potentially do practice chattel slavery, sending humans back to live in hobgoblin towns and cities as slaves. 
- There are significant details about the consequences of hobgoblin occupation spread across various notes; cf in particular [[Cleenseau History Notes]]

### Metaphysics and Creation
- Hobgoblins are the handiwork of the [[Void Mind]], a dark mirror to [[Humans]] in the schemes of the high gods. 
- Tales speak of legions first raised in secret before the [[The Downfall]], and later gathered under [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Great War]]. Whether clans share a single rite of origin, or many, remains unwritten in human records.
- They lack soulstuff entirely, and may actively repel soulstuff. 
- No magic can call a hobgoblin back from death, except perhaps revivify or similar magic cast within moments of death.
