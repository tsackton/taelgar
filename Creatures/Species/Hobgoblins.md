# Hobgoblins

Since the Great War, hobgoblin clans have appeared wherever frontiers grow thin. Most folk know them for disciplined columns, swift fortification of bridges and passes, and the grim habit of turning captured towns into garrisons and tax posts. Rumors from priests and philosophers whisper that they lack true souls, and that the dead among them do not return.
## Appearance

%% No canonical description of hobgoblin physical appearance is recorded in current vault notes. %%
## Language and Naming

Many envoys use the so‑called Goblin tongue to make themselves understood. Formal ranks and brusque manners are common in parley, though the finer points of naming remain the business of their officers.

## Lifecycle

%% No lifecycle, reproduction, or lifespan details for hobgoblins have been captured outside campaign notes. %%
## Settlements and Homelands

Hobgoblins favor hard country and chokepoints: the shoulders of the [[Sentinel Range]], the margins of the [[Plaguelands]], and exposed coasts where fleets can harry trade, such as parts of [[Irrla]]. They raise earthworks quickly, seize crossings, and garrison captured towns as command posts; one infamous example was the sack and fortification of [[Cleenseau]] during the Third Hobgoblin War. Border forts in Sembara and Dunmar still face south and west because of such campaigns.
## Cultural Traits

Under clan banners they rule like occupying armies: order first, tribute second. They confiscate arms, compel labor, and parcel out the best land to their officers. Resistance is punished severely, yet communities that submit are often taxed and conscripted rather than destroyed. Some clans bargain with strange allies or turn to piracy, but all uphold strict discipline and hierarchy.
## Historical Perspective

In the years after the Great War, hobgoblin hosts marched and settled through the Blood Years, sometimes ruling human lands for a generation before being driven back. Along the Enst and Aure valleys their wars reshaped borders; in Dunmar they held strongholds until northern armies erased them. The present peace rests on walls, watchtowers, and the hard memory of those years.

## Details for DMs

### Clans and Locales
- [[Shattered Ice Clan]] held stretches south of the [[Enst]] and west of the [[Aure]] between wars before being forced back into the Sentinels.
- [[Blackened Claw]] entrenched near [[Raven's Hold]] until destroyed in the [[Northern War]].
- Iron Fang remnants lingered around Isingue and the southern marches; Bitter Knife rose and fell along the Nashtkar.
- [[Skullcleaver Clan]] controls a hobgoblin realm on northeastern [[Irrla]] and shifted to piracy during the 1730s, constrained by [[Republic of Svolhas|Svolhas]].
- Remnants once ruled along the north [[Chardon]] coast; scattered bands still range north of [[Voltara]]. Borderworks in [[Xurkhaz]] and the [[March of Andonne]] face south because warbands still muster in ruined passes.

### Tactics and Occupation
- Seize crossings and high ground; throw up earthworks and palisades within days.
- Break mobility: destroy or control bridges (e.g., at [[Rinburg]]), cut roads, and anchor supply in fortified camps (e.g., near [[Dallet]]).
- Occupation policy: confiscate arms, tax harvests, assign labor quotas; brutality scales with resistance. When a town submits, they prefer garrisons and tribute over sack—when it does not, they make examples ([[Cleenseau]]).
- Adaptable modes of war: massed infantry with engineer cadres; in coastal realms, raiding fleets and maritime interdiction ([[Skullcleaver Clan]]).

### Using Hobgoblins in Play
- Strategic pressure: make crossings, roads, and granaries the stakes; let fort-building change the map between sessions.
- Occupier storylines: curfews, levies, banned militias, informants, and black markets. PCs break sieges, smuggle arms, rescue conscripts, or sabotage works.
- Flexible threats: infantry columns in the marches; pirate flotillas on Irrla; disciplined mercenaries in a human tyrant’s pay.
- Allies and foils: mind flayer advisers, dragon patrons, or rival clans; they negotiate when tribute or strategic withdrawal serves the campaign.

### Roleplaying Hobgoblins
- Voice and bearing: clipped orders, rank-first etiquette, tactical focus; contempt for disorder, respect for efficiency and brave opponents.
- Ethics of occupation: keep the roads open and the granaries full; punish rebels, tax the rest. Promises made by officers are enforced—until overruled by a higher rank.
- Negotiation: they bargain cleanly for hostages, tolls, and ceasefires; treachery is rare but swift when faced with deceit or broken terms.

## Metaphysics

Hobgoblins are widely believed to be the handiwork of the [[Void Mind]], a dark mirror to [[Humans]] in the schemes of the high gods. They are said to lack soulstuff entirely; many priests claim that no magic can call a hobgoblin back from death, though scholars debate rare exceptions.

## Creation Story

Tales speak of legions first raised in secret before the [[The Downfall]], and later gathered under [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Great War]]. Whether clans share a single rite of origin, or many, remains unwritten in human records.

I have some DM folder notes about hobgoblin tactics and such that might contribute to the vibe but are perhaps more specific to shattered ice and similar specific clans - tagging Mike until I get a chance to review 

should capture some vibes based details from various discussions and backlinks and history before marking page complete

notes from Discord

one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told
