# Hobgoblins

For most people in the modern day, hobgoblins are associated with the thud of iron-shod boots marching in lockstep; perfect, disciplined ranks of pikes; the ashy burning smell of fire sorcerers in the aftermath of battle. They formed the backbone of the armies of Cha'mutte during the Great War, and in the years since have remained a significant and often implacable enemy of many human (and other) realms. News of hobgoblin armies brings terror to cities and towns, for stories speak of their grim habit of turning captured towns into brutal work-camps, or worse. Among priests, theologians, and theological cosmologists, it is claimed that hobgoblins have no soul, no connection to any of [[Divine Realms]], and indeed many suspect that they actively repel the [[Divine Presence]] and its creations. 

## Appearance

Hobgoblins are often large and imposing, tending to be slightly larger and more muscular than humans, though with a large variation. Most hobgoblins have prominent fangs, ears, and brow ridges, and many have short horns protruding from their upper foreheads. A variety of reddish skin tones, red or golden eyes, and black hair is common. 

%% There is likely wide variation here, but this is the tendency for images I've made, cf [[Revaka]] %%

## Language and Naming

Most hobgoblins speak a common creole, derived from the language of Cha'mutte's armies, that is called _katonylev_ (or "army tongue") by speakers, is typically referred to as simply Goblin by outsiders. Whether hobgoblins speak other languages amongst themselves is not known. 

%% possibly there are clan-tongues too, or even a complex language history like humans, but this (a) not canonical, and (b) probably too complicated to develop. %%


%%^Campaign:None%%

Katonylev is based on Hungarian, which is an Uralic language most closely related to Finnish. In general any kind of consonant heavy names that feel vaguely "harsh" likely work, but names that feel very obviously Slavic should probably be avoided. Other hobgoblin languages may have diverse real world mappings, and it is possible for names to be in languages other than Goblin or retain aspects of clan-tongues, providing an easy way to explain / contextualize diverse hobgoblin names if needed.

## Lifecycle

Little is known about hobgoblin reproduction, age of maturity, family life, or aging. Hobgoblins have a natural lifespan similar to humans. 

%% likely that hobgoblins mature quickly and also have very short old ages %%

## Settlements and Homelands

Since Cha'mutte's defeat in the [[Great War]], hobgoblins have gradually been pushed away from human realms, and now tend to occupy marginal land where they can, surviving at the margins of the [[Plaguelands]], in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], and the northern slopes of the [[Fiatara Mountains]]. 

%% no other details of hobgoblin settlements are invented, though see DM Notes below. no details about hobgoblin towns or cities are invented. %%

## Cultural Traits
Hobgoblin societies are organized around discipline and strict hierarchy, with hobgoblins inevitably seen as above all other species. Occupation of the realms of other species, when hobgoblins manage it, can be brutal, but hobgoblins are not mindlessly evil. While in some cases they will decimate towns or conscript large swaths of the population into bondage and slavery, those that surrender are often taxed and put to work instead. Hobgoblins are unusual among the species of Taelgar in their practice of slavery.

Whether hobgoblins have art, or music, or other creative endeavors is not known, though a small number of decorative arts, particularly martial items, are known. 

Hobgoblins have no religion, worship no gods, and have never been observed to use divine magic. 

%% Presumably they suppress religion in areas they rule, but not sure if this has ever been fully established. %%

## Historical Perspective

The history of hobgoblins prior to the Great War is poorly known, though many fought in the wars between the [[Dominion of Avatus]] and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Wisford]], [[Addermarch]], and others, and hobgoblins were a major threat in northern [[Dunmar]] and the [[Aurbez Plateau]] area in the years before the [[Great War]]. 

Much of the decades after the [[Great War]], however, were defined by hobgoblin wars, shaping the history of [[Sembara]], [[Dunmar]], the [[Chardonian Empire]], and more. In these years, hobgoblins often ruled human lands for a generation, or more, before being driven back. 

%% see: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]; at some point, some player-facing summaries of the Blood Years hobgoblin wars might be useful %%

## Details for DMs 

### Clans and Locales
- [[Shattered Ice Clan]] held stretches south of the [[Enst]] and west of the [[Aure]] between wars before being forced back into the Sentinels.
- [[Blackened Claw]] entrenched near [[Raven's Hold]] until destroyed in the [[Northern War]].
- Iron Fang remnants lingered around Isingue and the southern marches; Bitter Knife rose and fell along the Nashtkar.
- [[Skullcleaver Clan]] controls a hobgoblin realm on northeastern [[Irrla]] and shifted to piracy during the 1730s, constrained by [[Republic of Svolhas|Svolhas]].
- Remnants once ruled along the north [[Chardon]] coast; scattered bands still range north of [[Voltara]]. Borderworks in [[Xurkhaz]] and the [[March of Andonne]] face south because warbands still muster in ruined passes.

### Tactics and Occupation
- Seize crossings and high ground; throw up earthworks and palisades within days.
- Break mobility: destroy or control bridges (e.g., at [[Rinburg]]), cut roads, and anchor supply in fortified camps (e.g., near [[Dallet]]).
- Occupation policy: confiscate arms, tax harvests, assign labor quotas; brutality scales with resistance. When a town submits, they prefer garrisons and tribute over sack—when it does not, they make examples ([[Cleenseau]]).
- Adaptable modes of war: massed infantry with engineer cadres; in coastal realms, raiding fleets and maritime interdiction ([[Skullcleaver Clan]]).

### Using Hobgoblins in Play
- Strategic pressure: make crossings, roads, and granaries the stakes; let fort-building change the map between sessions.
- Occupier storylines: curfews, levies, banned militias, informants, and black markets. PCs break sieges, smuggle arms, rescue conscripts, or sabotage works.
- Flexible threats: infantry columns in the marches; pirate flotillas on Irrla; disciplined mercenaries in a human tyrant’s pay.
- Allies and foils: mind flayer advisers, dragon patrons, or rival clans; they negotiate when tribute or strategic withdrawal serves the campaign.

### Roleplaying Hobgoblins
- Voice and bearing: clipped orders, rank-first etiquette, tactical focus; contempt for disorder, respect for efficiency and brave opponents.
- Ethics of occupation: keep the roads open and the granaries full; punish rebels, tax the rest. Promises made by officers are enforced—until overruled by a higher rank.
- Negotiation: they bargain cleanly for hostages, tolls, and ceasefires; treachery is rare but swift when faced with deceit or broken terms.

## Metaphysics

Hobgoblins are widely believed to be the handiwork of the [[Void Mind]], a dark mirror to [[Humans]] in the schemes of the high gods. They are said to lack soulstuff entirely; many priests claim that no magic can call a hobgoblin back from death, though scholars debate rare exceptions.

## Creation Story

Tales speak of legions first raised in secret before the [[The Downfall]], and later gathered under [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Great War]]. Whether clans share a single rite of origin, or many, remains unwritten in human records.

I have some DM folder notes about hobgoblin tactics and such that might contribute to the vibe but are perhaps more specific to shattered ice and similar specific clans - tagging Mike until I get a chance to review 

should capture some vibes based details from various discussions and backlinks and history before marking page complete

notes from Discord

one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told
