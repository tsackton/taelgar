# Kenku

Kenku, the birdfolk of Taelgar, favor high places and steady winds. Clifftop towns and pillar‑cities perch above sheltered harbors in the [[Eastern Green Sea]], while bands in the far north fly the cold thermals over open plains and mountain shoulders. Most travelers know them as keen‑eyed messengers, cliff pilots, and clever artisans; their homes are welcoming to guests, though not always easy for grounders to reach.

## Appearance

Kenku are humanoid birds. Most resemble ravens, hawks, owls, or eagles, with plumage, eyes, and beaks matching their avian kin. Feathered wings sprout from the back and support true flight. Clothing favors fitted flight leathers, windproof cloaks, and claw‑friendly fastenings.

%% Not enough canonical detail on regional plumage variation, body size ranges, or sexual dimorphism. %%

## Language and Naming

Kenku speak their own tongue and trade broadly in Common across the Green Sea. Names often echo birdsong or wind and sky motifs; travelers sometimes adopt descriptive bynames in human ports.

%% Not enough invented: naming patterns across islander vs northern kenku; written script; dialect families. %%

## Lifecycle

Kenku mature and age at roughly the same rate as humans. Clutch size, nesting seasonality, and elder care traditions are locally variable.

%% Not enough invented: egg/incubation details; rites of fledging; elder longevity extremes. %%

## Settlements and Homelands

The largest kenku communities in current travel routes cluster in the [[Vermillion Isles]] of the [[Eastern Green Sea]]. [[Wahacha]] is a notable port built in and among red stone pillars, with cliffside dwellings accessible primarily by flight. Farther north, kenku range across cold plains and mountains; small enclaves are reported in northern coasts and high ranges.

%% Not enough invented: full list/map of kenku settlements outside Wahacha; western presence west of the Sentinels; relations with northern polities. %%

## Cultural Traits

Kenku settlements are built upward: tiered ledges, suspended bridges, and aerie platforms. Ground quarters near harbors host visiting traders. Many kenku work as pilots, messengers, scouts, or artisans; island communities cultivate peppers and trade spices, wind‑crafted goods, and flight services.

%% Not enough invented: festivals, kinship structures, dispute resolution, hospitality codes for grounders, sky‑burial or other funerary rites. %%

## Historical Perspective

In living memory, kenku ports of the Eastern Green Sea have thrived as waypoints for halfling and human trade. Tales place their older heartlands in the far north among cold plains and mountains, but detailed histories are not widely shared with outsiders.

%% Not enough invented: kenku roles during the Great War/Blood Years; migration waves; relations with elves, dwarves, lizardfolk across eras. %%

%%^Campaign:None%%
## Metaphysics

Kenku are counted among the Elder Folk in travelogues, but their specific creator‑deity, afterlife beliefs, and soul practices are not recorded in open sources.

%% Not enough invented: creator(s), divine intermediaries, unique metaphysical traits beyond flight. %%

## Creation Story

Kenku epics and origin tales are largely kept within their communities. Outsiders record only that “the birdfolk remember the winds of the far north.”

%% Not enough invented: canonical creation narrative; ties (if any) to Embodied or Incorporeal gods. %%

## Details for DMs

### Where You’ll Find Them
- Eastern Green Sea: [[Wahacha]] in the [[Vermillion Isles]] (cliff‑built pillar city; spice trade; flight‑only quarters). Port master [[People/Kenku/Makha.md|Makha]] is a local point of contact.
- Islanders and travelers: [[People/Kenku/Nahto.md|Nahto]] and [[People/Kenku/Skoda.md|Skoda]] exemplify wandering island kenku; entanglements include aboleth threats and sea‑elf allies near Quanyi.
- Northern ranges: scouts like [[People/Kenku/Kecha.md|Kecha]] range over forests and mountains north of Vostok; northern aerie sites are implied but not cataloged in detail.

### Using Kenku in Play
- Vertical cities: navigation puzzles for ground‑based parties; flight‑path politics (air lanes, landing ledges, storm protocols).
- Trade arcs: pepper and spice caravans from Wahacha; courier contracts; pilotage through cliff gales and reef mazes.
- Rescue and sky‑hazards: storm rescues, aboleth entanglements around eastern isles, wyvern/roc territory disputes in the north.

### Roleplaying Kenku
- Voice and bearing: wind‑metaphors, clipped calls, keen observation; courteous to guests but prefer the sky and high places.
- Etiquette: ledge rights, landing permissions, and rope‑bridge precedence matter; grounders are welcome but expected to keep to harbor tiers without escorts.

### Conflicts and Open Questions
- Origins: Elder‑Folk status is implied but creator‑deity and metaphysics are undefined; decide whether they have an Embodied patron or venerate incorporeal wind/sky powers.
- Geography: northern heartlands lack canonical maps; define a few aerie cities and migration routes over the far north plains and ranges.
- Language: script, dialects, and influence of Eastros/Common in island ports vs. northern enclaves are not standardized.
- Flight and architecture: codify air‑traffic customs, no‑fly zones, emergency landing rites, and how cities interface with non‑fliers.
- Relations: establish treaties or frictions with nearby elves (forest aeries), dwarves (mountain passes), lizardfolk (island trade), and halflings (maritime commerce).
