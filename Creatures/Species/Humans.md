# Humans

Human are, by far, the most numerous sentient species on Taelgar, living in all corners of the world, across diverse cultures. Humans were created by the High Gods, the creator divinities [[Divine Presence|Arha]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]], and endowed with the divine spark, allowing human belief to empower the incorporeal gods.
