# Kobolds

This page contains lore information about kobolds. For details on character creation and playing a kobold, see [[Playing a Kobold]]. 

Kobolds in Taelgar are the children of great dragons of an age long past, created originally to be the servants, spies, and messengers of dragons. When the world was young, and the power of magic strong, they lived in the shadow of their creators and masters. Now, they live across the world, often in caves and tunnels. Renowned for their craftiness and trickery, some kobolds prey on other species, luring them into devious ambushes. Others worship their draconic creatures as gods, hoping to return to their rightful place at the side of the great wyrms of old. Still others forge their own way in the world, seeking their own path.

Some vibes-based details of how they have been used in play. 

### Addermarch Campaign

[[Zibzig Sparkscale]] featured one adventure. He was explicitly basically a run-away from home, somewhere undetermined. No details exist outside the linked note, really, but basically he was comic relief and roleplaying opportunity in a dungeon without many others. Some details on his "lair" in [[Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]]. 

### Great Library Campaign

Kobolds came up four in the Great Library campaign. 

- Originally in the first adventure as the occupants of a very simple lair, which was destroyed by party; portrayed basically as trying to hide from anyone. Worshipped a relic of elemental fire. See [[Session 1 - Fire Scroll - DM Notes]]
- Once as basically bandits, but bandits who were willing to ransom a hostage they had taken for coin. See [[Kobold Lair - DM Notes]]
- Once as kind of frenemies who could be bought off to help; they were more-or-less hired as guides to lead the party to a roc egg being help captive by a dao. See [[Roc Quest - DM Notes]]
- Once as servants (but vibe is kind of corrupted slaves) of a beholder - these were canonically the same group, or at least knew of, the original kobolds. Some were scared and basically slaves, others mind-controlled/corrupted: see [[Goldpeak Mines - DM Notes]]. 

In this campaign tended to play them as either cunning / clever but susceptible to bribery and greedy, or as a little naive/foolish and susceptible to browbeating or clever ruses. 

The bandits + dao scouts both had extensive lairs with traps. The beholder slaves and the fire elemental worshippers did not. 

### Dunmar Campaign

Kobolds have only come up really in connection to some stuff that Kadmos and friends ended up dealing with, rumors of kobold bandits on the Chardon-Dunmar road west of Songara. Note that this is implied to be a long-standing "problem" based on [[Kirian]], who was wounded in DR 1720s fighting kobolds in this area. 

Some more detail in a non-canonical planning note, brainstorming in case you ended up chasing kobold rumors. The basic vibe is likely true; certainly kobold bandits in the Myraeni Gap are canonical: 

*The land north and west of [[Songara]] is known as the Myraeni Gap, an expanse of rough, broken terrain, full of cliffs and gullies, as the land tumbles down from the high plateaus of Dunmar to wide lowlands stretching to Chardon and the sea. During the years before the Great War, the area was patrolled by a strange people who protected this the wild broken lands between Chardon and Dunmar, keeping the trade safe, but never allowing outsiders into their hill forts near the ~CentralMountains~. Since the chaos of the Blood Years, they have been rarely seen; in their absence kobolds have become a nuisance, exacting heavy tolls on trade and often turning to banditry. While many Dunmari are wary of inviting the Chardonian empire to their borders, some in [[Songara]] now council that the Empire may be the only option for keeping the roads safe and trade possible.*

Note that the vibe is not necessarily "war parties", and might involve more "contraptions that block the road unless you pay up." But none of this was canonically developed anyway. 

The one canon piece is that Marcella hid in kobold tunnels from Kadmos for awhile, at least implying a complicated underground lair.
