# Lizardfolk

%% status/needswork/incomplete -> Lifecycle needs some decisions to finalize %%

>[!quote] Lizardfolk saying, author unknown
*At misty daybreak*
*a quiet emerald swamp dreams*
*of the setting sun*

Lizardfolk dwell where water and land meet, most commonly in swamps, river basins, and tidal marshes. Their villages are well‑kept places of fish weirs and reedcraft, hidden boardwalks and raised hearths, vibrant and teeming with life. Elders guide growth so the land is never overburdened, and omens from dreams and ancestors mark important communal decisions. Though often living in isolated villages, when they settle near other species they are usually steady allies.

## Appearance

Lizardfolk are humanoid reptiles: upright, bipedal, hairless, with distinctly reptilian heads, and powerfully built, averaging about six feet tall with a slightly forward-canted posture, especially among those with particularly large tails. Their hides are close-fitting scales rather than skin; when fresh from water, they glisten and can throw tiny prismatic rainbows in mist and early sun. Lizardfolk coloration varies widely, though generally juveniles and adults are more likely to be brightly colored than elders, whose scales often fade to light blue-greens or other pastel colors, and lose the wet sheen. In moments of deep focus elders may seem to sparkle, and very rarely appear faintly translucent under direct sunlight.

## Language and Naming

Lizardfolk speak their own tongue, called Lizardling or sometimes Lizardfolk by outsiders, but also speak easily in trade pidgins when they settle near other species, and often learn the languages of their neighbors as well. Lizardfolk usually have a single given name, often chosen to honor a favored ancestor, though names tend not to repeat within a generation. Names are often passed down in families, and frequently, but not always, have some meaning. Lizardfolk will add home‑place or descriptor when needed abroad, but tend not to use family names in their home communities.

Lizardfolk names have often tended towards using an unusual language like Basque, to give them a distinctive feeling compared to human names, but this is not completely fixed and lizardfolk often work well for a kind of default 'fantasy' name unconnected to human languages. 

Generally, though, should avoid names that feel clearly linked to real Indo-European languages, and particularly to Tolkien-style Elvish or Dwarvish.

## Lifecycle

%% Lizardfolk lifecycle is all over the place:

- In the Kenzo solo, Eric played a lizardfolk adventurer caring for two young infants (pre-walking); these turned out not to really be lizardfolk but given these were not seen as unusual this puts constraints on lizardfolk childhood; in the Aursen marshes the Dunmar Fellowship also encountered a lizardfolk boy of 10 or 12, who looked relatively adult. 
- Lizardfolk elders have been given ages that range from ~115 to ~250, though I believe that most or all of the older individuals could be trivially retconned to be slightly younger if desired. 
- Some brainstorming has focused on two ideas:
	- Lizardfolk communities control fertility intentionally - perhaps new lizardfolk can only be born when the ancestors agree to give a new piece of soulstuff, or agree to allow a piece of themselves to be reincarnated, or something like that - the idea is this is not through strict social control but through magic and some kind of soultstuff vibe
	- Lizardfolk communities have an age structure heavily skewed towards elders; many lizardfolk young would know their great-grandparents and even great-great-grandparents, for example. The basic idea is that lizardfolk mature and age only a little slower than humans, so that something like from 20-100 is roughly equivalent to 20-60 for humans (2 lizardfolk years per 1 human year), but then from 100 on you have something like 5 lizardfolk years per 1 human year, meaning that 100-150 is basically 60s and 150-200 is basically 70s. Perhaps it speeds up a bit past 200. 
- There is a lot of variability in how we've treated young, including uncertainty as to whether lizardfolk bear live young or lay eggs; and uncertainty as to whether lizardfolk young have an aquatic or amphibious phase.
- Old text was: Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 5-8 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their second century, but few live much beyond 200 years.

## Settlements and Homelands

Lizardfolk communities are almost invariably found near water, typically in naturally occurring swamps and marshes, though some lizardfolk, such as the salt lizardfolk of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], settle in and around salt marshes, and others settle in river basins or near lakes which they frequently shape to create productive wetlands. Most lizardfolk villages are small, often tree-screened or otherwise hidden by the natural environment, nestled among weirs, fish ponds, and other modifications that create highly productive ecosystems. While some lizardfolk communities remain isolated from other species, they frequently settle near the towns and cities of humans and others, and often trade fish, herbs, and other goods, though usually maintain their own laws and society. Thus, while lizardfolk are often found near humans, they rarely are found living in human settlements. 

Some of the largest lizardfolk communities can be found in the [[Ozabal]] and [[Latazaro]] swamps near the [[Western Gulf]]; the [[~Yeraad Lizardfolk Swamp~]] south of [[Chardon]]; the salt marshes of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; and the rivers and wetlands of [[Portalia]] and [[Apporia]]. However, many small lizardfolk communities are scattered widely throughout the world, with villages as diverse [[Ganboa]], the tiny community on the [[Enst]] downriver from [[Cleenseau]]; the substantial lizardfolk towns on the outskirts of [[Adderfell]] and [[Darba]]; and the scattered villages of the [[Aursen Marshes]], just upriver from [[Aursenbourg]].

## Cultural Traits

Their ethos is cyclical and patient: balance the taking with the giving, and keep the waters living. Elders arbitrate disputes and births so food and space match the season; many lizardfolk serve as healers, fish‑wardens, or marsh‑guides among their neighbors. They favor fairness over fury, and even when war comes, they treat killing as a sorrow, not a habit. Relations with humans and halflings are commonly warm; elves’ aloofness and dwarven rigidity puzzle them, and kenku’s wildness tests their patience, yet they strive for empathy with all living things.

Most venerate the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]—the four Firstborn of the seasons: [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), [[Udazkena]] (autumn), and [[Negu]] (winter). Prayers and songs mark the seasonal round; dreams and omens from ancestors guide timing and taboo. The spirits of the dead are gathered by the Tharzen and return as new life when the waters rise again.

%% Old Text (Temperament): Lizardfolk feel a deep connection to the natural world, the elements and cycles of life, and the seasons. While they are not pacifists, they will rarely provoke fights or lose control of their tempers in a violent way. They believe very strongly in the circular nature of life, and feel that unjust deeds will be met in turn, giving them a strong sense of fairness and honor. They also believe in the preciousness of life, despite their long life spans, and see hurt, pain, and suffering as necessary evils at best. Many Lizardfolk find their calling as healers in the lands of other races. Most Lizardfolk also see themselves as protectors of their homelands; while this may necessitate violence, Lizardfolk generally strive not to become comfortable with a life of killing and destruction. %%
%% Old Text (Relations): Lizardfolk tend towards patience and empathy, which gives them a friendly outlook on most other races. They have a special affinity for humans and halflings, and Lizardfolk who leave their homes will often be found traveling in the company of Halflings or living in Human cities. Lizardfolk find the aloofness of the Elves, the tradition-bound rigid society of the Dwarves, and the chaotic nature of the Kenku hard to understand, but they strive to empathize with all living things. %%
%% Old Text (Tharzen): Through their land, Lizardfolk also maintain connections to the spirits of their ancestors, who are protected and guided by the Firstborn deities, the Tharzen Anzinakoa, the Eldest of Elders. They venerate with prayers and rituals four aspects of the Tharzen Anzinakoa, one for each season: Negu (winter), Udazkena (autumn), Bero (summer), and Hazkunde (spring). They see the Tharzen Anzinakoa as the bridge between themselves and the Divine, as guardian spirits, as protectors of their homelands. They believe the Tharzen Anzinakoa gather to them the spirits of Lizardfolk after they die, and create new souls from these ancestral spirits whenever a new Lizardfolk is born, and thus the cycle of birth and death is completed. %%

%% Old Text (Kin and Home): Lizardfolk have a strong bond with their close family, and if anything an even stronger bond with the swamps, forests, and other areas they call home. They live in small communities hidden in swamps and wet forests, usually led by a elder matriarch. They believe their ancestors’ spirits echo in the living things of their home, and even Lizardfolk who have traveled far from home will make pilgrimages to return and reconnect. Lizardfolk will also return to their homeland as they approach death; Lizardfolk who die far from home often become restless spirits until they can be given a proper burial with their ancestors. Lizardfolk see themselves as the caretakers of their land, and live in a way that preserves the wild beauty they love. They are resourceful in how they nourish themselves from the land, leaving little trace of their presence beyond their small villages and dwellings. %%


## Historical Perspective

After the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] reshaped coasts and rivers, many ancient wetlands shrank or shifted. The Ozabal and Latazaro are remembered as remnants of a greater marshland that once covered much of the lowlands. Through the Blood Years and later wars, lizardfolk villages tended to endure by keeping to the water‑roads, trading quietly with nearby towns, and tending their fisheries while armies marched on drier ground.

## Details for DMs

### Where You’ll Find Them
- Sembaran lowlands: Villages throughout the [[Ozabal]] swamps (Enst–Wistel confluence). Lizardfolk herbalists trade in nearby markets; cf. [[People/Lizardfolk/Gentza.md|Gentza]] (Cleenseau market), her teacher [[People/Lizardfolk/Unai.md|Unai]].
- Western Gulf and coast: Salt‑marsh communities between Tyrwingha and Western Cymea such as [[Latazaro]]; salt subspecies appear in coastal villages like [[People/Lizardfolk/Itzal.md|Eskorola]] near Hamri; roles include sea‑watchers and salvors; cf. [[People/PCs/Mawar/Trok.md|Trok]].
- Upper Istaros and Aurbez: Marsh hamlets along the [[Aursen Marshes]]; elders sometimes represent the marshfolk to the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] (cf. [[People/Lizardfolk/Aritza.md|Aritza]]).
- Far South jungles: The lizardfolk realm of [[Orekatu]] with settlements like [[Bedez]] near the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]; shamans and prophets feature prominently (cf. [[People/Lizardfolk/Elazar.md|Elazar]], [[People/PCs/Dunmar Fellowship/Guests/Izzarak.md|Izzarak]]).

### Religion and Metaphysics
- Tharzen Anzinakoa (Firstborn/Embodied Gods) in four seasonal faces: [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), [[Udazkena]] (autumn), [[Negu]] (winter). Seasonal rites pace planting, fishing, nesting, and travel; dreams and omens inform village decisions.
- Ancestor guidance is practical: auguries for timing, warnings of sickness, approvals for marriages or departures; reflected mechanically in “Omens of the Ancestors” (Augury) on [[Creatures/Mechanics/Playing a Lizardfolk.md]].
- Epics like ''[[The Endless Currents]]'' (see [[Cosmology/Planar Concepts/Extraplanar Weak Point.md]]) depict the Tharzen weaving connective threads across the world; some communities keep “life‑trees” (cf. ohana note under [[People/PCs/Dunmar Fellowship/Kenzo.md|Kenzo]]), believed to root in the Tharzen’s realm.
- Afterlife: spirits are gathered by the Tharzen and reborn with the rains; elders often return home to die so rebirth remains within the community waters.

### Ecology, Craft, and Trade
- Settlement engineering: fish weirs and ponds; raised boardwalks and stilted huts; nesting rafts; seasonal camps on higher hummocks for flood months.
- Crafts: reed boats and sails, woven traps, clay gourds for ritual water, medicinal herb lore; tattoos and inks in coastal “salt” communities (cf. Trok’s practice) sometimes tied to seasonal rites.
- Trade: fish, herbs, reeds, ferrying and guiding services; barter with nearby humans for iron tools, dye, salt, and textiles. Some villages maintain long‑standing market rights in adjacent towns.

### Polity and Custom
- Village‑first ethos under elder councils (often matriarch‑led). Elders mediate disputes, regulate births to balance carrying capacity, and sanction rites of departure/return.
- Burial/return: those dying far from home are brought back when possible; failure to do so risks restless spirits until ancestral rites are completed.

### Using Lizardfolk in Play
- Marsh hooks: fishing rights disputes, flood‑season evacuations, smuggling through reed‑channels, rescue/salvage under storm omens, curing a marsh‑fever with an elder’s herb lore.
- Spirit and season: an omen warns of a bad spawning cycle; a Tharzen rite must be performed at a ley‑tangled grove; a planar “thin place” (e.g., [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]) turns unstable.
- Diplomatic threads: a marsh elder seeks redress for a broken market promise; ferry rights at a new bridge; arranging safe passage for refugees through the wetlands.

### Roleplaying Lizardfolk
- Voice and bearing: calm, practical, season‑metaphor speech; village‑first pragmatism; consider pauses as if “listening” for omens.
- Ethics: balance over excess; fairness over fury; reverence for river and reed; killing is sorrowful work, not a habit.
- Mannerisms: test water with fingertips; carry reed tokens or water gourds; mark agreements with flowing‑water blessings.

### Conflicts and Open Questions
- Subspecies: “salt” lizardfolk appear in coastal villages (e.g., Eskorola). Are there consistent physiological/cultural differences (tattoo rites, saline diet) or is “salt” a local label? Canon not fixed.
- Adulthood and lifespan: sources describe adulthood in “late teens” versus “early 20s”; align mechanical and lore statements in species/playing pages.
- Afterlife mechanics: some texts imply direct rebirth from ancestral spirits; others the Elder‑Folk model of gifted soulstuff returning to divine realms. Decide if rebirth is metaphor, miracle, or norm.
- Law and treaties: several marsh communities trade under customary rights, but extent of formal charters (e.g., market days, ferry monopolies) is not fully documented outside Ozabal/Aursen examples.
- Language: degree of dialect diversity across riverine vs. salt‑marsh vs. jungle communities is unspecified; consider whether Common vs. Eastros usage varies by region.
- Orekatu geography: settlements (Bedez), the role of the Azta Lekua, and the scope of the realm need mapping and political detail; interaction with extraplanar weak points is fertile ground.
- Seasonal rites and magic: tattoos/inks, herbcraft, and ohana‑trees are attested locally; clarify which are regional traditions vs. near‑universal practices.

## Metaphysics

Lizardfolk are Elder Folk created by the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]—Embodied Gods of the seasons. As with other Elder Folk, they are gifted soulstuff from their creators. Community rites focus on dreams, omens, and ancestor guidance; the dead are gathered to the Tharzen and return as new lives in the cycle. Lizardfolk epics such as ''[[The Endless Currents]]'' speak of the Tharzen weaving threads through the Material Plane to bind the world and prevent cosmic sundering.

## Creation Story

In lizardfolk telling, the Tharzen walked the newborn marshes and braided water with soil, raising reeds and fish where their feet fell. They set elders to keep balance, taught the first songs, and promised that those who pass beneath the waters will return when the rains rise again.
