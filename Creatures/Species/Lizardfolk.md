# Lizardfolk

%% status/incomplete -> Lifecycle needs some decisions to finalize %%

>[!quote] Lizardfolk saying, author unknown
*At misty daybreak*
*a quiet emerald swamp dreams*
*of the setting sun*

Lizardfolk dwell where water and land meet, most commonly in swamps, river basins, and tidal marshes. Their villages are well‑kept places of fish weirs and reedcraft, hidden boardwalks and raised hearths, vibrant and teeming with life. Elders guide growth so the land is never overburdened, and omens from dreams and ancestors mark important communal decisions. Though often living in isolated villages, when they settle near other species they are usually steady allies.

## Appearance

Lizardfolk are humanoid reptiles: upright, bipedal, hairless, with distinctly reptilian heads, and powerfully built, averaging about six feet tall with a slightly forward-canted posture, especially among those with particularly large tails. Their hides are close-fitting scales rather than skin; when fresh from water, they glisten and can throw tiny prismatic rainbows in mist and early sun. Lizardfolk coloration varies widely, though generally juveniles and adults are more likely to be brightly colored than elders, whose scales often fade to light blue-greens or other pastel colors, and lose the wet sheen. In moments of deep focus elders may seem to sparkle, and very rarely appear faintly translucent under direct sunlight.

## Language and Naming

Lizardfolk speak their own tongue, called Lizardling or sometimes Lizardfolk by outsiders, but also speak easily in trade pidgins when they settle near other species, and often learn the languages of their neighbors as well. Lizardfolk usually have a single given name, often chosen to honor a favored ancestor, though names tend not to repeat within a generation. Names are often passed down in families, and frequently, but not always, have some meaning. Lizardfolk will add home‑place or descriptor when needed abroad, but tend not to use family names in their home communities. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
Lizardfolk names have often tended towards using an unusual language like Basque, to give them a distinctive feeling compared to human names, but this is not completely fixed and lizardfolk often work well for a kind of default 'fantasy' name unconnected to human languages. 

Generally, though, should avoid names that feel clearly linked to real Indo-European languages, and particularly to Tolkien-style Elvish or Dwarvish.

## Lifecycle

%% Lizardfolk lifecycle is all over the place:

- In the Kenzo solo, Eric played a lizardfolk adventurer caring for two young infants (pre-walking); these turned out not to really be lizardfolk but given these were not seen as unusual this puts constraints on lizardfolk childhood; in the Aursen marshes the Dunmar Fellowship also encountered a lizardfolk boy of 10 or 12, who looked relatively adult. 
- Lizardfolk elders have been given ages that range from ~115 to ~250, though I believe that most or all of the older individuals could be trivially retconned to be slightly younger if desired. 
- Some brainstorming has focused on two ideas:
	- Lizardfolk communities control fertility intentionally - perhaps new lizardfolk can only be born when the ancestors agree to give a new piece of soulstuff, or agree to allow a piece of themselves to be reincarnated, or something like that - the idea is this is not through strict social control but through magic and some kind of soultstuff vibe
	- Lizardfolk communities have an age structure heavily skewed towards elders; many lizardfolk young would know their great-grandparents and even great-great-grandparents, for example. The basic idea is that lizardfolk mature and age only a little slower than humans, so that something like from 20-100 is roughly equivalent to 20-60 for humans (2 lizardfolk years per 1 human year), but then from 100 on you have something like 5 lizardfolk years per 1 human year, meaning that 100-150 is basically 60s and 150-200 is basically 70s. Perhaps it speeds up a bit past 200. 
- There is a lot of variability in how we've treated young, including uncertainty as to whether lizardfolk bear live young or lay eggs; and uncertainty as to whether lizardfolk young have an aquatic or amphibious phase.
- Old text was: Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 5-8 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their second century, but few live much beyond 200 years.

## Settlements and Homelands

Lizardfolk communities are almost invariably found near water, typically in naturally occurring swamps and marshes, though some lizardfolk, such as the salt lizardfolk of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], settle in and around salt marshes, and others settle in river basins or near lakes which they frequently shape to create productive wetlands. Most lizardfolk villages are small, often tree-screened or otherwise hidden by the natural environment, nestled among weirs, fish ponds, and other modifications that create highly productive ecosystems. While some lizardfolk communities remain isolated from other species, they frequently settle near the towns and cities of humans and others, and often trade fish, herbs, and other goods, though usually maintain their own laws and society. Thus, while lizardfolk are often found near humans, they rarely are found living in human settlements. 

Some of the largest lizardfolk communities can be found in the [[Ozabal]] and [[Latazaro]] swamps near the [[Western Gulf]]; the [[~Yeraad Lizardfolk Swamp~]] south of [[Chardon]]; the salt marshes of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; and the rivers and wetlands of [[Portalia]] and [[Apporia]]. However, many small lizardfolk communities are scattered widely throughout the world, with villages as diverse [[Ganboa]], the tiny community on the [[Enst]] downriver from [[Cleenseau]]; the substantial lizardfolk towns on the outskirts of [[Adderfell]] and [[Darba]]; and the scattered villages of the [[Aursen Marshes]], just upriver from [[Aursenbourg]]. 

## Cultural Traits

%% Vibes seem reasonably clear?

- Ancestor oriented, elder ruled: lizardfolk settlements tend to gerontocracy, e.g some kind of council of elders would likely be very common. Elders/ancestors control a lot, though exactly how much is "ancestors" vs "elders" is not always clear. E.g., do elders make decisions about who can reproduce and when, or is it ancestors? Each have different implications. 
- Ancestor/elder orientation is likely also cultural, not just political, with maybe vaguely Confucianism vibes, though this is not really about ancestor worship per se; strong familial bonds though would be common. 
- Big part of vibes is intentional balance with ecosystems: shaping ecosystems to support high carrying capacities, but also shaping reproduction to stay within carrying capacity naturally. This also has an implication of "in tune with nature" type vibes, but I think not necessarily in the context of pure conservation, or at least not always or usually in the context of conservation; this is more about knowing nature extensively so you can manipulate it, or something like that. This also plays into kind of "hidden communities" vibes - lizardfolk are not building huge cities. 
- There is a vibe of a kind of special connection to homeland in older texts that might be worth connecting here. 
- Religion has long been very weakly defined; the "seasons" are a bit complicated because seasons vary from place to place. More than any other of the Firstborn species, lizardfolk might benefit a bit from regional "sects"? E.g. perhaps the lizardfolk of Sembara see the Tharzen Anzinakoa as seasonal but it wouldn't make sense for the lizardfolk of Darba to worship a spring or autumn god when there are really only two seasons, the hot dry season and the wet rainy season. I do like the idea that the number 4 is important in lizardfolk culture, and the general vibe of 4 as being seen as kind of fractal / cyclical, and the Tharzen Anzinakoa being seen as a kind of cycle of gods in some vague way. See more in [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]
- Longstanding connection to prophecy and divination that should be maintained as well
- Generally, a vibe of cycles, cyclical understanding, ancestral wisdom
- There is an older vibe of healing/pacifism that I'm not sure makes sense, and probably should be tossed.

## Historical Perspective

Lizardfolk communities are typically led by elders, with a strong connection to their ancestors. This perspective informs lizardfolk views of history: they often have deep ties to the local history of the land they live on, and many lizardfolk settlements claim to have lived in the same place since time immemorial. Indeed, many current lizardfolk communities are the remnants of vast ancient wetlands from before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] reshaped coasts and rivers, and many ancient wetlands shrank or shifted.

%% a bit thin but probably covers the vibes of deep ties to the history of the land; there is probably a little more to extract here from [[Land Holding in Sembara]] %%

## Details for DMs

### Open Questions and Further Work
- Lizardfolk lifecycle and lizardfolk cultural traits / religion are largely based on loose vibes at the moment. These could use some solid decisions and minor invention to clarify any loose ends. 
- Other open questions probably exist but are minor compared to the major gaps above; more will likely arise when someone plays a lizardfolk PC in a long campaign, but that has not happened yet (outside Sasha with Samso, but the Great Library campaign was very much not roleplay focused when it was running frequently).
- Subspecies: “salt” lizardfolk appear in coastal villages (e.g., Eskorola). Are there consistent physiological or cultural differences, is “salt” a local label specifically for Mawar, are their other "salt lizardfolk" communities?
- Afterlife mechanics: lots of variation and uncertainty about role of direct rebirth from ancestral spirits and generally how this connects to the  model of gifted soulstuff returning to divine realms. 
### Where You’ll Find Them
- Lizardfolk tend to be found in their own communities, often near human settlements, and invariably associated with water, usually with wetlands. 
- Lone lizardfolk travelers are plausible almost anywhere, but typically would need a reason for traveling. 
- Lizardfolk almost never settle embedded within human communities. A lone lizardfolk, a small group, or a lizardfolk enclave living in the city of another species needs a special explanation. A lone lizardfolk living alone in the wilderness would be less surprising and could have any number of reasons. 
- Invented regions with high numbers of lizardfolk include:
	- Greater Sembara: Major community in the [[Ozabal]] swamps (Enst–Wistel confluence) and the [[Latazaro]] (east of [[Tyrwingha]]), and scattered, potentially densely scattered, communities along the [[Enst]] (cf. [[Ganboa]]) and almost certainly many other places.  
	- Western Coast: Salt‑marsh communities in coastal villages like [[People/Lizardfolk/Itzal.md|Eskorola]] on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; fairly dense settlement in [[Apporia]] as well. 
	- Upper Istaros and Aurbez: Marsh hamlets along the [[Aursen Marshes]]
	- Far South jungles: The lizardfolk realm of [[Orekatu]] with settlements like [[Bedez]] near the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]].

### Religion and Metaphysics
- There is a LOT that is undeveloped about lizardfolk religion and metaphysics. The best current brainstorming is in [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]. 
- Asking the ancestors for guidance is very common among lizardfolk, and is reflected mechanically in the “Omens of the Ancestors” trait. 
- Creation story: some detail was invented for the Kenzo solo, specifically the idea that the [[Azta Lekua]] is the footprint of the gods, a relic from when the Firstborn walked the earth, their footsteps bringing rain and rivers and maybe wetlands to the world. 
- Some details of various kinds of lizardfolk-associated ki are in [[Kenzo]] notes. See below for relevant section.

### Lizardfolk Ki from Orekatu
*these notes might reflect general lizardfolk metaphysics / vibes, or might reflect something specific to the jungle lizardfolk of Orekatu*

The lizardfolk call ki arima, and at its most basic level, consider it the concentrated energy of the [[Plane of Souls]], which any living being on Taelgar can, in principle, learn to channel. However, the lizardfolk spirit guides and prophets speak of many other forms of ki, which are the echoes and resonances of the higher spiritual planes, and which are often difficult or impossible to channel without an appropriate focus. While the lizardfolk think of this ki as “spiritual harmonics”, these echoes of other planes in the fabric of Taelgar has other names in other places. Chalyte, for example, is a stone that gathers the resonances of the [[Plane of Magic]]. 

Kenzo learned about the following plants and the kinds of ki they can channel: 

Amezza: Amezza is the name for a common jungle tree, generally short and shrubby, that grows in openings and clearings. The name, roughly translated, means “dreamberry”; the aromatic berries are dried and traded as a spice. When the tree grows in a place rich in connections to the [[Dreamworld]], the berries collect amezza, also known as dream ki. But care must be taken, because Amezza can also absorb the energy of nightmares and not everything in the Dreamworld is friendly. 

Hutsu: Hutsu in the name for a flowering vine that is common across the tropical regions of Taelgar, which grows up the trunks of large trees. When it grows near places of peaceful death, the leaves occasionally turn white, giving it its translated name in Common, “whiteleaf vine”. When hutsu vines grow in places with a strong connection to the [[Land of the Dead]], the white leaves collect hutsu, also known as spirit ki.

Ohana: Ohana is the name for the largest of the jungle trees, a species that is typically dominant among the emergent trees that grow above the rainforest canopy. These trees grow in places rich in connection to the outer planes of primal power, particularly [[Arborea]] but also any other spiritual plane that is connected to primal forces of nature, growth, abundance, wildness. When they grow in such places, they will often grow small branches that drop off naturally, the bark of which is infused with ohana, also known as life ki or lushness ki. The lizardfolk believe that Ohana trees have a special connection to Zerua, the home of the Tharzen Anzinakoa. %%name Zerua is not canonical and could be changed %%

Urtaro: Urtaro is the name for a lilypad that grows in still water and swamps, frequently cultivated by lizardfolk communities for its beauty and also as food (the tubers are highly nutritious and are made into a starch used to make a variety of things). When grown in places of great peace and beauty, especially places cultivated and tended, urtaro flowers sometimes develop a connection to planes of order and beauty. The flowers become infused with urtaro, also known as solid ki or permanence ki, thought of as the energy of solid things, the bones, the mountains, the earth, the permanent structures on which life can grow and thrive. 

### Ecology, Craft, and Trade
- Lizardfolk are exceptionally good at settlement engineering: they make fish weirs and ponds; raised boardwalks and stilted huts; nesting rafts; and generally coax extreme productivity from the lands they settle, usually without obvious, intensive agriculture (no fields of wheat or anything). 
- In many games, lizardfolk have been associated with herbalism, medicinal herb lore, and general plant lore; in Mawar, [[Trok]] is a tattoo warrior, with tattoos associated with the salt lizardfolk, but unclear if this is general. 
- Lizardfolk often trade with human communities (cf [[Ganboa]]). 

---
### Polity and Custom
- Village‑first ethos under elder councils (often matriarch‑led). Elders mediate disputes, regulate births to balance carrying capacity, and sanction rites of departure/return.
- Burial/return: those dying far from home are brought back when possible; failure to do so risks restless spirits until ancestral rites are completed.

### Using Lizardfolk in Play
- Marsh hooks: fishing rights disputes, flood‑season evacuations, smuggling through reed‑channels, rescue/salvage under storm omens, curing a marsh‑fever with an elder’s herb lore.
- Spirit and season: an omen warns of a bad spawning cycle; a Tharzen rite must be performed at a ley‑tangled grove; a planar “thin place” (e.g., [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]) turns unstable.
- Diplomatic threads: a marsh elder seeks redress for a broken market promise; ferry rights at a new bridge; arranging safe passage for refugees through the wetlands.

### Roleplaying Lizardfolk
- Voice and bearing: calm, practical, season‑metaphor speech; village‑first pragmatism; consider pauses as if “listening” for omens.
- Ethics: balance over excess; fairness over fury; reverence for river and reed; killing is sorrowful work, not a habit.
- Mannerisms: test water with fingertips; carry reed tokens or water gourds; mark agreements with flowing‑water blessings.
