# Lizardfolk
Lizardfolk dwell where water and land braid together: swamps, river basins, and tidal marshes. Their villages are quiet, well‑kept places of fish weirs and reedcraft, hidden boardwalks and raised hearths. Elders guide growth so the land is never overburdened, and omens from dreams and ancestors mark when it is time to plant, to hunt, or to move the nesting rafts. They are steady allies to nearby towns, ferrying news and fish to market, trading herbs and reedwork for iron, dye, or salt.

%% Old Text (Vibe): The quiet flash of fireflies on a summer night, the dawn song of nesting warblers, the midday croak of the bullfrog -- these speak of home to the Lizardfolk. At home between the water and the land, Lizardfolk communities tend to grow up in wild places near water, often swamps and wetlands, where they live a peaceful life of contemplation and repose. When they venture out into the world, they have a striking and often menacing appearance, but despite their reptilian looks, Lizardfolk are compassionate friends and dedicated members of their communities, of any race. %%

## Appearance

Most stand near six feet with a forward‑canted stance balanced by a heavy tail. Scales glisten when fresh from the water; in mist and early sun the spine can cast prismatic rainbows. Hatchlings emerge pale and translucent with gills, taking on limbs and scales within weeks; youths wear vibrant blue‑greens with streaks of muddy green or, rarely, brilliant facial blues. Elders often fade to light blue‑green and lose the wet sheen; in moments of deep insight some seem to sparkle, even grow faintly translucent in direct sun.

%% Old Text (Appearance 1): Lizardfolk stand an average of six feet tall with a slightly forward crouching stance, to balance a three foot long tail. They are finely scaled and have a perpetual glistening appearance, highlighting there frightening reptilian visage. If the sun catches a lizardfolk just as emerging from the water into early morning swamp mist, the arrangement of scales along their spine creates a prism effect, scattering tiny rainbows. Infants are born a translucent pale blue, with gills that disappear as limbs sprout and the scales grow over the course of a few weeks. Youths are a vibrant blue green, often with streaks of a greenish brown, or, very rarely, brilliant blue marks about the face. %%
%% Old Text (Appearance 2): For the large part of their lives, though, most Lizardfolk are a variety of greens and browns. Extremely aged Lizardfolk, especially the elders, develop a uniformly light blue or light blue green coloration and don't glisten as though wet, though in moments of insight, they seem to sparkle a bit and, on very rare occasions, seem ever so slightly transparent to direct sunlight. %%

## Language and Naming

Lizardfolk speak their own tongue and trade easily in Common along the river routes. Names are usually a single given name, often chosen to honor a favored ancestor, with a home‑place or descriptor appended when needed abroad. Names tend not to repeat within a generation, but echo across eras as the elders remember.

%% Old Text (Names): Lizardfolk names are often passed down among families, and usually have some meaning in family lore or history. Clan names are not used; when traveling outside their homeland, they will often adopt the name of the home as a clan name when needed, however. Male Names: Arran, Aitor, Arzhider, Benat, Eneko, Ganiz, Ilari, Itzal, Mattin, Samso, Zorion, Zuzen. Female Names: Alasne, Amaya, Arrosa, Elixane, Iara, Irati, Joska, Leire, Maialen, Naiara, Nerea, Ximenia, Xuxa. %%

## Lifecycle

Egg‑hatchlings spend 5–8 years amphibious in shallows and reed huts, then shed gills as scales thicken and limbs strengthen. Adulthood comes in the late teens to early twenties; most live well into their second century, with a few elders passing two hundred winters.

%% Old Text (Lifecycle): Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their early 20s; the first 5-8 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Most live into their second century, but few live much beyond 200 years. %%

## Settlements and Homelands

Swamp and river are home. In Sembara, the [[Ozabal]] lowlands harbor many villages at the Enst–Wistel confluence; along the Western Gulf the [[Latazaro]] swamps mark an old heartland between Tyrwingha and Western Cymea; up the Aursen, marsh hamlets line the [[Aursen Marshes]] at the foot of the plateau. Villages are small, tree‑screened, and often matriarch‑led, with weirs, fish ponds, and trails laid to flood and drain with the seasons. Lizardfolk close to human towns trade fish, herbs, and reedworks and act as ferrymen, guides, and healers, yet usually keep their own laws and camps apart.

%% Old Text (Kin and Home): Lizardfolk have a strong bond with their close family, and if anything an even stronger bond with the swamps, forests, and other areas they call home. They live in small communities hidden in swamps and wet forests, usually led by a elder matriarch. They believe their ancestors’ spirits echo in the living things of their home, and even Lizardfolk who have traveled far from home will make pilgrimages to return and reconnect. Lizardfolk will also return to their homeland as they approach death; Lizardfolk who die far from home often become restless spirits until they can be given a proper burial with their ancestors. Lizardfolk see themselves as the caretakers of their land, and live in a way that preserves the wild beauty they love. They are resourceful in how they nourish themselves from the land, leaving little trace of their presence beyond their small villages and dwellings. %%

## Cultural Traits

Their ethos is cyclical and patient: balance the taking with the giving, and keep the waters living. Elders arbitrate disputes and births so food and space match the season; many lizardfolk serve as healers, fish‑wardens, or marsh‑guides among their neighbors. They favor fairness over fury, and even when war comes, they treat killing as a sorrow, not a habit. Relations with humans and halflings are commonly warm; elves’ aloofness and dwarven rigidity puzzle them, and kenku’s wildness tests their patience, yet they strive for empathy with all living things.

Most venerate the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]—the four Firstborn of the seasons: [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), [[Udazkena]] (autumn), and [[Negu]] (winter). Prayers and songs mark the seasonal round; dreams and omens from ancestors guide timing and taboo. The spirits of the dead are gathered by the Tharzen and return as new life when the waters rise again.

%% Old Text (Temperament): Lizardfolk feel a deep connection to the natural world, the elements and cycles of life, and the seasons. While they are not pacifists, they will rarely provoke fights or lose control of their tempers in a violent way. They believe very strongly in the circular nature of life, and feel that unjust deeds will be met in turn, giving them a strong sense of fairness and honor. They also believe in the preciousness of life, despite their long life spans, and see hurt, pain, and suffering as necessary evils at best. Many Lizardfolk find their calling as healers in the lands of other races. Most Lizardfolk also see themselves as protectors of their homelands; while this may necessitate violence, Lizardfolk generally strive not to become comfortable with a life of killing and destruction. %%
%% Old Text (Relations): Lizardfolk tend towards patience and empathy, which gives them a friendly outlook on most other races. They have a special affinity for humans and halflings, and Lizardfolk who leave their homes will often be found traveling in the company of Halflings or living in Human cities. Lizardfolk find the aloofness of the Elves, the tradition-bound rigid society of the Dwarves, and the chaotic nature of the Kenku hard to understand, but they strive to empathize with all living things. %%
%% Old Text (Tharzen): Through their land, Lizardfolk also maintain connections to the spirits of their ancestors, who are protected and guided by the Firstborn deities, the Tharzen Anzinakoa, the Eldest of Elders. They venerate with prayers and rituals four aspects of the Tharzen Anzinakoa, one for each season: Negu (winter), Udazkena (autumn), Bero (summer), and Hazkunde (spring). They see the Tharzen Anzinakoa as the bridge between themselves and the Divine, as guardian spirits, as protectors of their homelands. They believe the Tharzen Anzinakoa gather to them the spirits of Lizardfolk after they die, and create new souls from these ancestral spirits whenever a new Lizardfolk is born, and thus the cycle of birth and death is completed. %%

## Historical Perspective

After the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] reshaped coasts and rivers, many ancient wetlands shrank or shifted. The Ozabal and Latazaro are remembered as remnants of a greater marshland that once covered much of the lowlands. Through the Blood Years and later wars, lizardfolk villages tended to endure by keeping to the water‑roads, trading quietly with nearby towns, and tending their fisheries while armies marched on drier ground.

%% Old Text (Haiku): At misty daybreak; a quiet emerald swamp dreams; of the setting sun. %%

## Metaphysics

Lizardfolk are Elder Folk created by the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]—Embodied Gods of the seasons. As with other Elder Folk, they are gifted soulstuff from their creators. Community rites focus on dreams, omens, and ancestor guidance; the dead are gathered to the Tharzen and return as new lives in the cycle. Lizardfolk epics such as ''[[The Endless Currents]]'' speak of the Tharzen weaving threads through the Material Plane to bind the world and prevent cosmic sundering.

## Creation Story

In lizardfolk telling, the Tharzen walked the newborn marshes and braided water with soil, raising reeds and fish where their feet fell. They set elders to keep balance, taught the first songs, and promised that those who pass beneath the waters will return when the rains rise again.
