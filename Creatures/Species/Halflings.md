# Halflings

On roads and riverways, and in every harbor along the [[Green Sea]], halfling caravans and crews are a familiar sight. Most folk know them as cheerful traders and tireless sailors, quick with a song or a story and quicker still to strike a fair bargain. They travel in tight‑knit family companies, keep excellent inns at busy crossroads, and have a reputation for remembering favors—and settling them—even generations later. Halflings commonly speak mind‑to‑mind among themselves, and their storytellers are famed for carrying memories older than any living person.
## Appearance

Halflings are small and sturdy, usually no more than 3 to 3½ feet tall, with a tendency toward a healthy stoutness and curly hair. Otherwise, they are quite variable in appearance, with diverse complexions, though with a strong tendency for bright eyes, usually green, brown, or hazel. Halflings favor practical garb, and often prefer travel‑ready coats and trousers built for long walks to more elaborate gear, though many cannot resist a few flashes of color and style. A halfling traveler, in muted traveler's clothes, with a brightly colored cloak or a well-tailored hat is a common sight. 
## Language and Naming

Constant travel leaves most halflings are comfortable speaking in many tongues. Silent, mind‑to‑mind speech is ordinary among them; caravans and crews often confer in silence before answering difficult questions, and private matters are rarely spoken aloud. Songs and stories are usually spoken or sung in the Halfling language, which is rarely taught to outsiders. For dealings with others, halflings usually speak one or more of the various trade pidgins popular across the world. Some scholars even claim these languages were invented by, or at least popularized by, early halfling traders and sailors. 

Names usually pair a short given name with a distinctive family name, sometimes related to a trade, place, or storied deed, but often simply a pleasing-sounding invention.

Generally tend towards kind of English-like given names, perhaps a reflection of their typical practice of giving their names in Common, not Halfling. Have trended to following typical D&D/Tolkien vibes, though it is plausible that halflings to the far east or south could have different naming patterns, potentially reflecting the vibes of alternate trade tongues. 

Family names are classic D&D/Tolkien in style, possibly glossed as usually translated into Common in-world. Currently have assumed that each family name is unique (e.g., all Goodbarrels are related somehow), but not obvious this must be the case.

## Lifecycle

Halflings reach maturity in their early 20s and commonly live a little past 100; a lucky few see longer. Families are broadly extended and communitarian in habit: caravans and ship crews are typically kin companies first and businesses second, with apprentices, in‑laws, and the occasional foundling folded into the roll.

## Settlements and Homelands

Halflings claim no singular homeland. Those that settle typically do so among other species. Halfling communities can be found in dwarven cities high in the mountains, small farming villages, bustling ports, lively cities, and even the occasional lizardfolk river-town. Lively harbor taverns, bustling crossroads inns, and market‑side yards run by halfling families are commonplace in many parts of the world, for when halflings do settle, they tend to cluster where movement concentrates: at river landings, ports, crossroads, tollgates, and market environs. In many places, halfling‑kept inns act as wayhouses, mail drops, price boards, and hubs of halfling community, providing a homely welcome, information, and gossip to travelers, while also ensuring that even settled halflings remain threaded into the wider network of travel, trade, and kin.

Most halflings, however, simply never settle down. Whether they sail the Green Sea, traveling from port to port, or wander the roads of the Chardonian Empire, or even make great continent spanning journeys over years of travel, small communities of halflings can be found moving from place to place, rarely staying more than a season or year. Welcomed wherever they go, but driven by wanderlust to avoid putting down roots, these communities trade stories and goods for company, food, and drink. 

While it is not uncommon to see lone halflings, or small groups, on the road to somewhere, many halflings travel in larger communities that combine a family business and a mobile village. While these caravans and ships are usually owned by a specific clan, all who travel together are treated as family, and share equally in the profits and loss of trade, after the needs of the group have been taken care of. 

## Cultural Traits

Hospitality, memory, and fair dealing define their public face. Travelers speak of halfling feasts and long evenings of song; merchants learn that debts of kindness may be repaid at surprising moments, and that word of treachery travels fast. Discipline aboard ship and loyalty within the company sit alongside an easy warmth with strangers who come in peace. Memory‑debts are honored [[Story About Halfling Merchants|even across generations]]; a favor owed by a great‑grandparent may be repaid in coin, bargain, or feast when a caravan next passes through.

Halflings honor their firstborn creator gods, who they call the First Ones—Nwana (the Stranger and Child), Obito (the Music‑Maker and Merchant), and Jemghari (the Storyteller and Wanderer)—through songs, toasts, and shared remembrance rather than temples. Shrines are often places of good memory: a favored overlook, a quiet grove off the trade road, the hearth of a well‑kept inn. History‑bearers and story-keepers serve as the informal clergy of halfling communities, bearing and retelling the memories that bind kin together, marking beginnings and endings with prayers to remember well.



In law and custom, halflings often travel under ancient charters that grant free movement and limited extraterritorial rights. In Sembara, for instance, halflings maintain long‑standing treaties on passage and trade; some inns are recognized as folkland; and a halfling “Royal Observer” attends sessions of the Royal Council with voice but no vote, speaking to matters that touch halfling rights and roads.


Halfling culture centers on mobility, mutual aid, and the exchange of news. Wanderlust is treated less as a quirk than as a rite of passage: most young adults spend years “on the road” or “before the mast,” rotating through caravan work, ship duty, and innkeeping. Families commonly pool resources across wide kin-networks, adopting partners and long-term shipmates into clan households. Hospitality is formalized—travelers are fed first and paid later—and reputations for generosity or miserliness follow families from port to port. Storytelling, music, and shared ledgers serve practical ends as well as entertainment: tales carry wayfinding and cautionary detail, while route books track prices, tolls, hazards, and seasonal conditions.

Some memories themselves become shrines of a sort, layered and re‑experienced through the racial consciousness so that later generations recall not only the first moment, but also the telling of that moment by a famed story‑keeper. 

%% Old Text (Wanderers Connected): Living in small family groups usually apart from others of their race, halflings have no formal government or organized political structure. However, they remain connected to each other no matter how far apart via the collective memory of their ancestors, the halfling soulmind. This consciousness is central to halflings’ self conception as race. In significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals: they are also always part of this whole. Some halflings describe it as like waves on the ocean: individuals are patterns that arise, and come together, and move and come apart, distinct, but fundamentally part of one ocean. This conception of a shared soulmind, a shared racial consciousness, profoundly shapes their encounters with each other: that they're one single family, connected even if they haven't met. %%

%%They have a reputation as generous and sharing, free with aid when they encounter travelers in need. They are also loyal to their companions, whether halfling or not, knowing that on the open road in a dangerous world, trust and loyalty can be all that keep you alive.  %%

%% Old Text (First Ones & Practice): This racial consciousness is guarded, watched over, and nurtured by the [[First Ones]], the Firstborn gods of the halflings: Nwana, the Stranger and Child; Obito, the Music Maker and Merchant; and Jemghari, the Storyteller and Traveler. While halflings do not have deep traditions of prayer, or organized religious practice, the First Ones are an ever-present backdrop to halfling life. Every experience, every memory of a halfling’s life will eventually contribute in some small way to the greater halfling consciousness, and for many halflings simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is all that is needed to pay homage to their creators. %%

%% Old Text (Professions & Values): As travelers driven by wanderlust, most halflings find themselves in professions that lend themselves to this lifestyle: traders, merchants, sailors, wandering bards, and sometimes even pirates or bandits. Natural sailors, ships crewed by halflings sail to far-away ports across the ocean and return with rare trade goods and unbelievable tales. Halflings love stories, both the telling and the hearing. They have little use for material wealth, preferring not to accumulate more than they can comfortably carry with them, but will often value a few precious mementos highly. As traders and merchants they seek unusual goods, whether rare magics or beautiful art or exotic spices. They enjoy living life to its fullest no matter where they may be, and are eternal optimists even in dire times. %%

%% Old Text (Music & Improvisation): Halflings are also noted musicians and bards and storytellers. Halfling artists and musicians, in particular, tend to embrace the notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- which mirrors halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness. Halfling music is usually improvisational because of this, and, in Taelgar, they are the originators of jazz and related musical traditions. %%

%% Old Text (Culture) 

As reflected in the nature of the First Ones, much of Halfling identity is based around encounter with other. Halflings are wanderers and the traders, seeking outward-facing encounters with other communities and races and cultures. They are also storytellers and musicians, inward-facing bearers of cultural history and identity, and the keepers of the secret halfling language, not taught to outsiders.

As people always on the road, halflings have a very expansive notion of family and hospitality, at least among their own kind. One halfing can always expect to share another’s camp and companionship, and notions of the obligations of hospitality to fellow halflings are deeply ingrained in their culture.

The traditions of hospitality are in part as strong as they are because of the reality of the halfling racial consciousness. Although the First Ones are centrally important in halfling life and culture, much of their centrality arises from their role as the guardians, shapers, keepers, and ultimately creators of the halfling soulmind, the joint racial consciousness of all halflings. This consciousness is central to halflings’ self conception as race. In significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals: they are also always part of this whole. Some halflings describe it as like waves on the ocean: individuals are patterns that arise, and come together, and move and come apart, distinct, but fundamentally part of one ocean. This conception of a shared soulmind, a shared racial consciousness, profoundly shapes their encounters with each other: that they're one single family, connected even if they haven't met. It's not a belief in personal reincarnation, exactly, but it's a different sort of relationship with death to have that sense of how individual and collective meet.

Halfling art and culture embraces the idea that permanent and unchanging things get expressed in unique and changing forms, that the journey, the next step, is always different, and even the same road changes with the seasons and years. They do not build much in the way of permanent structures, and their art does not seek to create artificial perfection. Instead, they see an embrace of imperfection is more reflective of life-as-it-is than something artificially made to be perfect.

Halflings are noted musicians and bards and storytellers. Halfling artists and musicians, in particular, tend to embrace the notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- which mirrors halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness. Halfling music is usually improvisational because of this, and, in Taelgar, they are the originators of jazz and related musical traditions.

%% Old Text (Magic)
Halfling magical traditions draw heavily on the embodied power of the First Ones and the halfling soulmind. Because of this, halflings are drawn to magic focused on on telepathy, charm, communication, and illusion; as a general matter halfling magic is subtle and halflings that embrace flashy wizard magic are rare, although not unheard of.

## Historical Perspective

For generations, halfling companies and crews have tied distant ports and border towns together, carrying news and trade even in hard years. In the aftermath of the Great War and the unsettled years that followed, their caravans and cogs threaded the gaps, keeping markets supplied, stories alive, and distant kin in quiet conversation. Ballads collected as the [[Halfling Shanties of the Green Sea]] describe runs from Tollen’s dyes to kenku islands and the northern frostlands for dragonhide—routes that continue in the present day. Many of the oldest crossroads inns in Sembara and the Western Gulf trace their tenure to those years when halfling networks quietly held the world together.


%% history 

Halflings don’t record their history; they remember it. The tale of years is told, and told again, created and recreated by the history-tellers and story keepers of each generation, and then recalled as their memories join the racial awareness when they pass on from their individual lives. This living relationship to history means that years are not numbered and dated from fixed points in time. Instead, halflings refer to the song of years and the sagas of eras to mark their history. However, these tellings are held close to the halfling race, and they use more standard reckoning of dates when talking with the outside world.

For halflings, remembering their history and the worship of the First Ones are deeply connected. History-bearers, those who are especially deeply connected to the racial memory through long practice, tell stories of the past, and often dedicate themselves to composing a great story or song as their life’s work. These songs become the songs of years -- some spanning eras, others a single year. While few know the full song of years, the history-bearers and their connection to the racial mind are part of the fabric of halfling culture and ensure that the old stories are not forgotten.

## Details for DMs

### Where You’ll Find Them
- Along the Green Sea, halfling flags are common in the Western Gulf between [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], and Sembaran ports; farther east, halfling crews run longer legs between [[Wahacha]] and the cold trading grounds near [[Praznitsky]].
- Green Sea trade: halfling crews and factors running dyes out of [[Tollen]], calling at kenku ports like [[Wahacha]], and ranging as far as the cold reaches around [[Praznitsky]]. See songs in [[Halfling Shanties of the Green Sea]].
- Overland routes: family caravans linking duchies and border towns; frequent presence at crossroads inns, river landings, and toll bridges.
- Integrated communities: halfling wards in mixed towns; folkland‑status inns that predate recent charters; small enclaves in dwarven hill country.

### Religion and Metaphysics
- The [[First Ones]]—Nwana, Obito, and Jemghari—anchor halfling belief. Formal temples are rare; shrines are often places of good memory and strong feeling.
- Halflings share an ancestral racial memory (often called the soulmind) and commonly communicate mind‑to‑mind. History‑bearers serve as keepers of story and rite. For mechanics and tone, see [[Playing a Halfing]].
- After death, memories are said to join the great halfling consciousness rather than linger as individual souls; priests claim this is why some memories feel “shared” among kin.

### Trade Practices and Institutions
- Route‑libraries and price boards at halfling wayhouses support route knowledge and commodity rate sharing across families.
- Guildhall‑style inns double as hiring posts, mail drops, and kin registries; caravans and ships post shares, crews, and routes.
- Risk management varies by region: caravans in the Western Gulf operate like generational communities; long‑sea routes use tighter crews, formal shares, and ad‑hoc mutual insurance among kin companies.

## Ship and Caravan Crews
Halfling ships are organized like large halfling caravans. Usually, members of the clan that owns the ship make up at least half the crew, and fill most, although often not all, the officer positions. The rest of the crew is often made up of various individuals with their own reasons for travel: children of sedentary halflings who want adventure, or land-based clans that want to experience the sea; survivors of shipwrecks and other disasters; partners of the main clan; and other idiosyncratic folks.

Profits of the journey are usually split evenly, after the needs o the ship have been taken care of, although typically excess funds are retained in a ship's account and paid out based on time served on departure of a crew member, or to their clan on death. Purchases with ship funds are typically agreed by majority vote, and all halflings who are part of the crew share equally, and are treated as family.

 Ship companies generally use a share system that combines pay and ownership, with shares reallocated as sailors age out and apprentices rise; accounts are settled when a crew member departs or, on death, to their clan. Vessels are sized and rigged for halfling crews—tight-decked and efficient—with orders carried aloud on watch and most one-to-one conversation conducted by mind-speech. Crews are often drawn largely from the owning clan, which fills most officer posts, with additional hands recruited from partner families and trusted independents.

### Law

Halflings have no homeland, and spend most of their lives traveling through and across the lands of others. As they are small people, noted more for their good nature and quick feet than any strength in arms, if a community of larger, stronger folks decides to rob or kill them, there is often little they can do in the moment.

However, it is hard to get away with murder when the memories of those you kill don’t end with their death, and halflings are deeply concerned with righting those of their kind that are wronged. While most halflings tend towards nonviolence themselves, those that don’t often justify their actions as vengeance and retribution for those of their kind that were wronged.

Between the risk of a quiet dagger and the possibility of economic retribution, most human communities tend to treat halflings well, and give them legal privileges others don’t have. Rumors of places it is not safe to go spread quickly through the halfling community, and these places soon find themselves with no halfling caravans willing to bring goods to market there, or buy goods to take to market elsewhere.

### Using Halflings in Play
- Trade networks: use halfling companies to move news, goods, and rumors across frontiers; a single family badge can recur across ports and roads.
- Memory‑debts: hooks where a favor owed to an ancestor is repaid—or called in—at an inconvenient moment; excellent leverage for intrigue without villains.
- Crossroads and inns: hubs for gathering parties, black‑market exchanges, and neutral‑ground parleys. Some freeholds operate outside ordinary manorial ties.
- Sea arcs: shanties, storms, and salvage; halfling crews make fine patrons, rivals, or employers for maritime adventures.

### Roleplaying Halflings
- Voice and bearing: warm, quick‑witted, and observant; direct in business, expansive in hospitality.
- Ethics: a deal kept is a reputation earned; generosity where it binds communities together; sharp memory for slights against kin or guests.
- Table mannerisms: spontaneous songs; toasts naming absent friends; quiet mind‑to‑mind “aside” between kin before answering a hard question.

### Conflicts and Open Questions
- Geographic spread in earlier eras: some notes emphasize halflings concentrated around the eastern Green Sea, while others imply wider early presence. Clarify how far west halfling sea‑lanes and caravans reached before modern times.
- Trade tongues: some discussions credit halflings with shaping the spread of Common; the languages overview frames Common as a human‑derived pidgin broadly adopted by halflings. Decide whether halfling influence was formative or primarily distributive.
 - Memory shrines: practice is described both as place‑based (natural overlooks, groves, hearths) and as memory‑network loci re‑experienced through the soulmind. Decide how overt or mystical this feels in play.
 - Ships and crews: Western Gulf voyages feel like traveling clans; long‑sea routes resemble professional share‑crews. Calibrate how often families bring elders and children aboard outside the Gulf.
 - Law and charters: scope of free‑movement treaties and folkland recognitions (especially in Sembara) varies by source; finalize the “Royal Observer” custom’s origin, term, and which family currently holds it.

### Brainstorming 
Experience time all at once

The "one song"

Conclave of halflings to determine the song of the year

Think about how time flows for halflings

Halfling gods connection to time -- the story of the years already exists and the telling is remembering in a sense

Connection to firstborn, the “memories of the future”

Racial consciousness connects here too, perhaps somehow they can remember the future?

Halflings count the days since time began, in a long cycle that repeats.

## Metaphysics

Common belief holds that the First Ones keep halfling memories in trust and that halflings can share thoughts in silence; scholars debate how, priests call it a blessing, and most people simply accept that halflings remember what matters.

## Creation Story

Stories say the First Ones set halflings wandering with music, trade, and tales to bind the world together. Whether a single origin or many, the details are kept within their songs and rites rather than written in foreign books.

## Sea Shanties

Halflings sing on their ships. Here are two popular halfling songs.
