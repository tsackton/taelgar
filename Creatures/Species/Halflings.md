# Halflings

%% @mike: cleaned up DM notes to remove AI slop, bouncing back for any final edits %%

On roads and riverways, and in every harbor along the [[Green Sea]], halfling caravans and crews are a familiar sight. Most folk know them as cheerful traders and tireless sailors, quick with a song or a story and quicker still to strike a fair bargain. They travel in tight‑knit family companies, keep excellent inns at busy crossroads, and have a reputation for remembering favors—and settling them—even generations later. Halflings commonly speak mind‑to‑mind among themselves, and their storytellers are famed for carrying memories older than any living person.
## Appearance

Halflings are small and sturdy, usually no more than 3 to 3½ feet tall, with a tendency toward a healthy stoutness and curly hair. Otherwise, they are quite variable in appearance, with diverse complexions, though with a strong tendency for bright eyes, usually green, brown, or hazel. Halflings favor practical garb, and often prefer travel‑ready coats and trousers built for long walks to more elaborate gear, though many cannot resist a few flashes of color and style. A halfling traveler, in muted traveler's clothes, with a brightly colored cloak or a well-tailored hat is a common sight. 
## Language and Naming

Constant travel leaves most halflings are comfortable speaking in many tongues. Silent, mind‑to‑mind speech is ordinary among them; caravans and crews often confer in silence before answering difficult questions, and private matters are rarely spoken aloud. Songs and stories are usually spoken or sung in the Halfling language, which is rarely taught to outsiders. For dealings with others, halflings usually speak one or more of the various trade pidgins popular across the world. Some scholars even claim these languages were invented by, or at least popularized by, early halfling traders and sailors. 

Names usually pair a short given name with a distinctive family name, sometimes related to a trade, place, or storied deed, but often simply a pleasing-sounding invention.

Generally tend towards kind of English-like given names, perhaps a reflection of their typical practice of giving their names in Common, not Halfling. Have trended to following typical D&D/Tolkien vibes, though it is plausible that halflings to the far east or south could have different naming patterns, potentially reflecting the vibes of alternate trade tongues. 

Family names are classic D&D/Tolkien in style, possibly glossed as usually translated into Common in-world. Currently have assumed that each family name is unique (e.g., all Goodbarrels are related somehow), but not obvious this must be the case.

## Lifecycle

Halflings reach maturity in their early 20s and commonly live a little past 100; a lucky few live longer. Families are broadly extended and communitarian in habit: caravans and ship crews are typically kin companies first and businesses second, with apprentices, in‑laws, and the occasional foundling or wanderer folded into the roll.
## Settlements and Homelands

Halflings are wanderers, claiming no homeland. Those that settle typically do so among other species. Halfling communities can be found in dwarven cities high in the mountains, human farming villages, bustling ports, cosmopolitan cities, and even the occasional lizardfolk river-town. Lively harbor taverns, bustling crossroads inns, and market‑side yards run by halfling families are commonplace in many parts of the world, for when halflings do settle, they tend to cluster where movement concentrates: at river landings, ports, crossroads, tollgates, and market environs. In many places, halfling‑kept inns act as wayhouses, mail drops, price boards, and hubs of halfling community, providing a homely welcome, information, and gossip to travelers, while also ensuring that even settled halflings remain threaded into the wider network of travel, trade, and kin.

Most halflings, however, simply never settle down. Whether they sail the Green Sea, traveling from port to port, or wander the roads of the Chardonian Empire, or even make great continent spanning journeys over years of travel, small communities of halflings can be found moving from place to place, rarely staying more than a season or year. Welcomed wherever they go, but driven by wanderlust to avoid putting down roots, these communities trade stories and goods for company, food, and drink. 

While it is not uncommon to see lone halflings, or small groups, on the road to somewhere, many halflings travel in larger communities that combine a family business and a mobile village. While these caravans and ships are usually owned by a specific clan, all who travel together are treated as family, and share equally in the profits and loss of trade, after the needs of the group have been taken care of. 

## Cultural Traits

Hospitality, memory, and fair dealing define their public face. Travelers speak of halfling feasts and long evenings of song; merchants learn that debts of kindness may be repaid at surprising moments, and that word of treachery travels fast. Discipline aboard ship and loyalty within the company sit alongside an easy warmth with strangers who come in peace. Memory‑debts are honored [[Story About Halfling Merchants|even across generations]]; a favor owed by a great‑grandparent may be repaid in coin, bargain, or feast when a caravan next passes through.

### Religion
_See more: [[Halfling Religious Practice]]_

Most halflings honor their firstborn creator gods, who they call the [[First Ones]]—[[Nwana]] (the Stranger and Child), [[Obito]] (the Music‑Maker and Merchant), and [[Jemghari]] (the Storyteller and Wanderer)—through songs, toasts, and shared remembrance rather than temples. Shrines are often places of good memory: a favored overlook, a quiet grove off the trade road, the hearth of a well‑kept inn. History‑bearers and story-keepers serve as the informal clergy of halfling communities, bearing and retelling the memories that bind kin together, marking beginnings and endings with prayers to remember well. In their telling, certain events, repeatedly retold, become layered memories, recalled not only as they occurred but as they were later narrated. Nonetheless, for many halflings, simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is all that is needed to pay homage to their creators.

### The Shared Ancestral Mind

Halfling identity is anchored in a shared ancestral mind—a collective memory in which individual lives contribute to a larger continuity. The ancestral mind is described as an ocean of recollection in which persons are distinct waves: unique, transient forms arising from and returning to a common whole. This outlook shapes social conduct: in significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals, but also always part of this whole, one single family connected, even if they haven't met. Thus, one halfling can always expect to share another’s camp and companionship, halflings treat one another as extended kin even on first meeting, and they often speak of the act of meeting as also an act of remembering. 

### Arts and Music

Stories are central to halfling religion, and to their experience and connection to their shared ancestral mind. Thus, many halflings are noted musicians, bards, and storytellers, and halflings have their own unique musical and artistic traditions. 

Halfling music is often improvisational, extemporized over stable patterns, reflecting a philosophy that enduring forms are best expressed through unique performances, and connecting to the halfling understanding of selfhood: each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of a universal ancestral mind of halfling-ness. Halfling art often strives to express the idea that permanent and unchanging things are always being expressed in unique and changing forms. The journey, the next step, is always different, and even the same road changes with the seasons and years.

Many halfling songs are also practical, and sea shanties are common on halfling ships. These are two popular songs from the western Green Sea:

The Green Sea Calls: ![[green-sea-calls.mp3]]
The Dyes of Tollen:

![[dyes-of-tollen.mp3]]

## Historical Perspective

Halflings don’t record their history; they remember it. The tale of years is told, and told again, created and recreated by the history-tellers and story keepers of each generation, and then recalled as their memories join the ancestral awareness when they pass on from their individual lives. This living relationship to history means that years are not numbered and dated from fixed points in time. Instead, halflings refer to the song of years and the sagas of eras to mark their history, with each year given a unique name that spreads among the halfling community via their shared ancestral mind. 

%% note re above: Schwartz invented the idea of a yearly conclave that tells the story of the past year and names it, though whether this is a halfling-wide thing or just a Green Sea tradition is not developed %%

In these ancient tales of years, halflings tell of wandering even when the world was new, when songs could sing sustenance into existence. They tell the stories of meeting humans, of the new songs of trade, of the world changing, yet always halfling journeys as a constant thread of connection. Many halflings claim they were the first to sail the Green Sea, and as the world changed again and again they were always there, to tell the new stories.

## Details for DMs
### Open Questions and Further Work
* The religious experience is only lightly developed and no canon exists on the halfling creation story or metaphysics. Do the [[First Ones]] have a Divine Realm? How does this relate to the idea of a halfling ancestral consciousness?
* Metaphysics: halflings presumably have a gifted soul from the First Ones, but does that have any further implications?
* Language: what is the relationship between halflings and trade tongues. Does this need to be clarified? One idea: halflings invented trade tongues. Another idea: halflings popularized and maintain trade tongues
* Language: does the actual spoken halfling language have a specific real world analog? 
* Creation story is completely missing as is any sense of pre-Downfall history and origin and migration points. Some notes emphasize halflings concentrated around the Green Sea, while others imply wider early presence. Is the Green Sea a "homeland" of sorts, or not?

### Where You’ll Find Them
- Generally, halflings can show up anywhere, traveling or settled
- Common everyone in the [[Green Sea]], throughout the rivers and roads of [[Sembara]], in the [[Nevos Sea]] and [[Gulf of Chardon]], amongst other places. Outside of a few very unique places ([[Ursk]], [[Xurkhaz]]) there is nowhere it would be implausible for a halfling to be
- In general, most common as a traveling caravan or vessel; plausible as a settled community or small family group anywhere there is trade, roads - but an individual or small group could really be anywhere, for unique reasons
- Renowned as sailors, and many long distance ships are halfling owned and crewed
- However, halfling villages and towns don't really exist; when they settle it is with other species
- Of all the "Elder Folk", halflings are by far the most likely to be found living with humans and others, often in long-term co-existence (cf [[Vargaldi]]) 

###  Halflings in Play
- Typical professions: as travelers driven by wanderlust, many halflings are traders, merchants, sailors, bards, and sometimes even pirates or bandits. Those who do settle often gravitate towards inns and taverns, and are frequently innkeepers. This doesn't mean there can't be like a halfling tailor in a big city, but that would be at least slightly unusual compared to a typical halfing. 
- Vibes: many halflings are story oriented and love both the telling and the hearing of tales; many also tend not to care deeply for material wealth, preferring not to accumulate more than they can comfortably carry with them, but of course these don't have to be universally true. Halflings tend to be true to their word, and remember ancient oaths more than others, though like all people they are not necessarily perfect. Reputation, however, is likely fairly central in halfling communities and a reputation for evil spreads fast through the ancestral mind. Halfling villains are certainly possible but would usually be isolated and exiled from their halfling kin. 
- Trade: halflings often seek unusual goods, and low-bulk, high-value goods; a halfling grain caravan is possible, but relatively unlikely compared to e.g. spices. 
- Magic: halfling provide a good opportunity to expose strange quirks of the ancestral memory, e.g. halflings remembering someone's distant ancestors or similar. Halflings are a good opportunity for unusual magic around memory and telepathy: in the [[Great War Campaign]] halflings were used to send long distance telepathic messages, and in the [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]] [[Wellby]] had the ability to telepathically communicate with animals, and occasionally was able to gain flashes of memories of halflings from the past (cf [[Wellby]] page).

### Religion and Metaphysics
- A key component of halfling metaphysics is the "ancestral memory" (sometimes called the soulmind in older brainstorming). The exact details of this are not well developed. It is mechanically represented by the "Memory of the Ancestors" trait, and in play this often takes the form of having access to the memories of other halflings, in glimpses at least. However, the implications for the metaphysics of halfling gods, the fate of halflings after death, and the plane of the halfling firstborn are not invented. Some ideas:
	- One possibility is that the "ancestral memory" is, in fact, the plane of the halfling firstborn, and halflings have an extraplanar connection to this place which allows them access to these memories. This threads a bunch of needles and seems like the most likely option.
	- Some early brainstorming alternatively focused on the plane of consciousness, and the role of mind-to-mind connections on the plane of consciousness instead, tying the ancestral memory more closely to telepathy. A possibility here is that halflings uniquely are able to leave "impressions" of some kind in the plane of consciousness, such that halfling memories and minds continue to exist as echoes for a long time, possibly forever, after death. This separates "memories" from "souls" and might have some useful implications; it also separates the halfling Firstborn from the ancestral memories a little bit, which might be good or bad. 
	- The implications of any of these ideas for resurrection is not developed, though Wellby did travel to the Land of the Dead when he was killed by Grash and was later resurrected using Raise Dead with no problem by Riswynn (cf [[Session 88 (DuFr)]])
- Halfling religious practice is partially developed in [[Halfling Religious Practice]]. The basic vibes should be considered canonical, and there should not be temples to the First Ones in halfling communities or anything like that. 
- There is a strand of development / world-building that connects story-keepers / lore-keepers / history-bearers to a kind of priesthood. This should be continued, but does not have to be the only kind of priest-like group / figure in halfling culture or society. 
- At least in the western Green Sea, there is a yearly conclave of halflings that many attend, a kind of party / religious holiday / community building event that also determines the "song of the year". The exact nature of this event, whether it is a Green-Sea-specific thing or worldwide, whether there are one or many, whether this is a halfling religious holiday, etc, are not really determined.
- Halfling religious holidays (except the "conclave", above) are yet to be invented but probably exist? Though might not?

### Law & Governance

- Halflings usually live among other species, in small traveling groups. This means that there isn't really a "halfling law" that is separate from family bonds and small communities. In most cases, halfling law boils down to either making restitution or being exiled, with exile being the most severe punishment. The ancestral mind presumably keeps memories of punishments so you can't avoid exile by joining the next ship, and reputation is deeply important. But likely halflings are also prone to forgiveness, so it is rare to be permanently branded an exile. 
- As a small, widely traveled people, with no army or other obvious means of physical deterrence, halflings rely on collective memory, especially the idea (which may be partially myth encouraged by halflings) that the memories of the dead are accessible to the living. So if you murder a halfling, the victim passes the memory to the ancestral mind so their relatives can punish you. This kind of reputation helps to deter violence and other malicious behavior against halfling travelers. 
- Related to this: halflings have a reputation for having long memories, often cross-generational (cf [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]). Unexpected punishments -- in lost trade opportunities or good deals for your competitors or similar commercial concerns, especially -- can come years after the original cause. At the same time, unexpected boons can come the same way. 
- Unsafe towns lose halfling custom, and economic boycotts can cause significant harm to small and large communities alike. Halflings cultivate a reputation for collective action, so malicious acts against one halfling group may bring boycotts from all halflings -- often a big risk for a town or village. 
- Because of these considerations, halflings very frequently have special consideration in the laws of the communities they inhabit. Various kinds of charters, compacts, and treaties often guarantee passage across the realms of other species, protect caravans/wayhouses, and grant limited extraterritoriality to recognized freeholds (such as established inns).  

### Trade Practices, Ships, Caravans
- Many halfling ships and caravans function like a mix of a family business and a small village. Though presumably the details are variable, a common model is more-or-less a worker-owned collective, though potentially family elders may have more "shares" than outsiders or newcomers. So for example a typical halfling trading vessel on the Green Sea might first take care of ship needs from profits (repairs, restocking, etc), and then pay out remaining funds equally, or equally by share, though many of the crew would likely hold their funds in a common "bank" of some kind and only withdraw when needed. However, this doesn't have to be the only arrangement, just should probably be the most common one. Cf [[Things/Ships/Emerald Song|Emerald Song]], [[Wave Dancer]], [[Summer's Breeze]], [[Stormdancer]] for halfling ships introduced in play, and [[Charmhearts]] for a halfling family caravan introduced in play, also [[Merriweathers]] for smaller scale merchants. 
- Halfling inns and taverns probably play a common role of helping keep information moving, find crew, etc. Cf [[Session 47 (DuFr)]], when Wellby goes to the halfling inn in Darba for information about ships, etc. Cf [[Stonebridges]] for halfling inn (though note [[Oona Stonebridge]]).
- Halflings play a bit of a unique role in the Taelgar sailing ecosystem: they are should have a reputation as great sailors, and also adventurous sailors who are the ones that make the long journeys to distant lands and have the best blue-water ships. This doesn't mean there are no human sailors, obviously, and halfling ships tend to small and maneuverable, often carrying light, high-value cargo. But if a ship comes into port in Chardon from across the Sea of Storms bringing exotic goods from the far south, odds are it is halfling owned and crewed. Cf [[Ship Designs in Taelgar]] for some brainstorming notes.

### Brainstorming 
*These are ideas that have come up, largely in discussions with Schwartz.*

- Halflings perhaps experience time all at once somehow? As the "one song"? Think about how time flows for halflings
- Conclave of halflings to determine the song of the year
- Halflings count the days since time began, in a long cycle that repeats.
- Halfling gods connection to time -- the story of the years already exists and the telling is remembering in a sense; connection to firstborn, the “memories of the future”. Racial consciousness connects here too, perhaps somehow they can remember the future?
- Creation Story: The First Ones set halflings wandering so music, trade, and tales would bind the world; origins are preserved in songs and rites rather than foreign chronicles.
