# Halflings

%% Tim: only some notes in the "details for DMS" section %%

On roads and riverways, and in every harbor along the [[Green Sea]], halfling caravans and crews are a familiar sight. Most folk know them as cheerful traders and tireless sailors, quick with a song or a story and quicker still to strike a fair bargain. They travel in tight‑knit family companies, keep excellent inns at busy crossroads, and have a reputation for remembering favors—and settling them—even generations later. Halflings commonly speak mind‑to‑mind among themselves, and their storytellers are famed for carrying memories older than any living person.
## Appearance

Halflings are small and sturdy, usually no more than 3 to 3½ feet tall, with a tendency toward a healthy stoutness and curly hair. Otherwise, they are quite variable in appearance, with diverse complexions, though with a strong tendency for bright eyes, usually green, brown, or hazel. Halflings favor practical garb, and often prefer travel‑ready coats and trousers built for long walks to more elaborate gear, though many cannot resist a few flashes of color and style. A halfling traveler, in muted traveler's clothes, with a brightly colored cloak or a well-tailored hat is a common sight. 
## Language and Naming

Constant travel leaves most halflings are comfortable speaking in many tongues. Silent, mind‑to‑mind speech is ordinary among them; caravans and crews often confer in silence before answering difficult questions, and private matters are rarely spoken aloud. Songs and stories are usually spoken or sung in the Halfling language, which is rarely taught to outsiders. For dealings with others, halflings usually speak one or more of the various trade pidgins popular across the world. Some scholars even claim these languages were invented by, or at least popularized by, early halfling traders and sailors. 

Names usually pair a short given name with a distinctive family name, sometimes related to a trade, place, or storied deed, but often simply a pleasing-sounding invention.

Generally tend towards kind of English-like given names, perhaps a reflection of their typical practice of giving their names in Common, not Halfling. Have trended to following typical D&D/Tolkien vibes, though it is plausible that halflings to the far east or south could have different naming patterns, potentially reflecting the vibes of alternate trade tongues. 

Family names are classic D&D/Tolkien in style, possibly glossed as usually translated into Common in-world. Currently have assumed that each family name is unique (e.g., all Goodbarrels are related somehow), but not obvious this must be the case.

## Lifecycle

Halflings reach maturity in their early 20s and commonly live a little past 100; a lucky few see longer. Families are broadly extended and communitarian in habit: caravans and ship crews are typically kin companies first and businesses second, with apprentices, in‑laws, and the occasional foundling folded into the roll.
## Settlements and Homelands

Halflings are wanderers, claiming no singular homeland. Those that settle typically do so among other species. Halfling communities can be found in dwarven cities high in the mountains, human farming villages, bustling ports, cosmopolitan cities, and even the occasional lizardfolk river-town. Lively harbor taverns, bustling crossroads inns, and market‑side yards run by halfling families are commonplace in many parts of the world, for when halflings do settle, they tend to cluster where movement concentrates: at river landings, ports, crossroads, tollgates, and market environs. In many places, halfling‑kept inns act as wayhouses, mail drops, price boards, and hubs of halfling community, providing a homely welcome, information, and gossip to travelers, while also ensuring that even settled halflings remain threaded into the wider network of travel, trade, and kin.

Most halflings, however, simply never settle down. Whether they sail the Green Sea, traveling from port to port, or wander the roads of the Chardonian Empire, or even make great continent spanning journeys over years of travel, small communities of halflings can be found moving from place to place, rarely staying more than a season or year. Welcomed wherever they go, but driven by wanderlust to avoid putting down roots, these communities trade stories and goods for company, food, and drink. 

While it is not uncommon to see lone halflings, or small groups, on the road to somewhere, many halflings travel in larger communities that combine a family business and a mobile village. While these caravans and ships are usually owned by a specific clan, all who travel together are treated as family, and share equally in the profits and loss of trade, after the needs of the group have been taken care of. 

## Cultural Traits

Hospitality, memory, and fair dealing define their public face. Travelers speak of halfling feasts and long evenings of song; merchants learn that debts of kindness may be repaid at surprising moments, and that word of treachery travels fast. Discipline aboard ship and loyalty within the company sit alongside an easy warmth with strangers who come in peace. Memory‑debts are honored [[Story About Halfling Merchants|even across generations]]; a favor owed by a great‑grandparent may be repaid in coin, bargain, or feast when a caravan next passes through.

### Religion

Most halflings honor their firstborn creator gods, who they call the [[First Ones]]—[[Nwana]] (the Stranger and Child), [[Obito]] (the Music‑Maker and Merchant), and [[Jemghari]] (the Storyteller and Wanderer)—through songs, toasts, and shared remembrance rather than temples. Shrines are often places of good memory: a favored overlook, a quiet grove off the trade road, the hearth of a well‑kept inn. History‑bearers and story-keepers serve as the informal clergy of halfling communities, bearing and retelling the memories that bind kin together, marking beginnings and endings with prayers to remember well. In their telling, certain events, repeatedly retold, become layered memories, recalled not only as they occurred but as they were later narrated. Nonetheless, for many halflings, simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is all that is needed to pay homage to their creators.

### The Shared Ancestral Mind

Halfling identity is anchored in a shared ancestral mind—a collective memory in which individual lives contribute to a larger continuity. The ancestral mind is described as an ocean of recollection in which persons are distinct waves: unique, transient forms arising from and returning to a common whole. This outlook shapes social conduct: in significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals, but also always part of this whole, one single family connected, even if they haven't met. Thus, one halfling can always expect to share another’s camp and companionship, halflings treat one another as extended kin even on first meeting, and they often speak of the act of meeting as also an act of remembering. 

### Arts and Music

Stories are central to halfling religion, and to their experience and connection to their shared ancestral mind. Thus, many halflings are noted musicians, bards, and storytellers, and halflings have their own unique musical and artistic traditions. 

Halfling music is often improvisational, extemporized over stable patterns, reflecting a philosophy that enduring forms are best expressed through unique performances, and connecting to the halfling understanding of selfhood: each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of a universal ancestral mind of halfling-ness. Halfling art often strives to express the idea that permanent and unchanging things are always being expressed in unique and changing forms. The journey, the next step, is always different, and even the same road changes with the seasons and years.

Many halfling songs are also practical, and sea shanties are common on halfling ships. These are two popular songs from the western Green Sea:

The Green Sea Calls: ![[green-sea-calls.mp3]]
The Dyes of Tollen:

![[dyes-of-tollen.mp3]]

## Historical Perspective

Halflings don’t record their history; they remember it. The tale of years is told, and told again, created and recreated by the history-tellers and story keepers of each generation, and then recalled as their memories join the ancestral awareness when they pass on from their individual lives. This living relationship to history means that years are not numbered and dated from fixed points in time. Instead, halflings refer to the song of years and the sagas of eras to mark their history. 

In these ancient tales of years, halflings tell of wandering even when the world was new, when songs could sing sustenance into existence. They tell the stories of meeting humans, of the new songs of trade, of the world changing, yet always halfling journeys as a constant thread of connection. Many halflings claim they were the first to sail the Green Sea, and as the world changed again and again they were always there, to tell the new stories.

## Details for DMs
### Open Questions and Further Work
* The religious experience is only lightly developed and no canon exists on the halfling creation story or metaphysics. Do the [[First Ones]] have a Divine Realm? How does this relate to the idea of a halfling ancestral consciousness?
* Metaphysics: halflings presumably have a gifted soul from the First Ones, but does that have any further implications?
* Language: what is the relationship between halflings and trade tongues. Does this need to be clarified? One idea: halflings invented trade tongues. Another idea: halflings popularized and maintain trade tongues
* Language: does the actual spoken halfling language have a specific real world analog? 
* Creation story is completely missing as is any sense of pre-Downfall history and origin and migration points. Some notes emphasize halflings concentrated around the Green Sea, while others imply wider early presence. Is the Green Sea a "homeland" of sorts, or not?
### Where You’ll Find Them
- Generally, halflings can show up anywhere, traveling or settled
- Common everyone in the [[Green Sea]], throughout the rivers and roads of [[Sembara]], in the [[Nevos Sea]] and [[Gulf of Chardon]], amongst other places. Outside of a few very unique places ([[Ursk]], [[Xurkhaz]]) there is nowhere it would be implausible for a halfling to be
- In general, most common as a travelling caravan or vessel; plausible as a settled community or small family group anywhere there is trade, roads - but an individual or small group could really be anywhere, for unique reasons
- However, halfling villages and towns don't really exist; when they settle it is with other species

### Religion and Metaphysics
- The [[First Ones]]—Nwana, Obito, and Jemghari—anchor halfling belief. Formal temples are rare or non-existant; shrines are often places of good memory and strong feeling.
- Halflings share an ancestral memory (often called the soulmind in older brainstorming, but no canonical name) and commonly communicate mind‑to‑mind. History‑bearers serve as keepers of story and rite.
- After death, memories are said to join the great halfling consciousness rather than linger as individual souls; priests claim this is why some memories feel “shared” among kin. 
### Trade Practices and Institutions
- Route‑libraries and price boards at halfling wayhouses support route knowledge and commodity rate sharing across families
- Guildhall‑style inns double as hiring posts, mail drops, and kin registries; caravans and ships post shares, crews, and routes.
### Ship & Caravan Crews

- **Crew makeup:** Owner-clan often, but not always, supplies ≥50% of crew and most officers; remaining berths go to partner families and trusted independents (adventurous youths, land-clan sailors, shipwreck survivors, specialists).
- **Natural sailors:** Renowned for blue-water routes and tight ship-handling; vessels are compact, efficient, and optimized for halfling crews.
- **Profits**: Profits of the journey are usually split evenly, after the needs of the ship have been taken care of, although typically excess funds are retained in a ship's account and paid out based on time served on departure of a crew member, or to their clan on death.
- **Governance aboard:** Major purchases by majority vote; all halfling crew treated as family; orders called aloud on watch; one-to-one counsel via **mind-speech**.
- **Caravan parity:** Road companies mirror sea practice—pooled funds, rotating duties, and organizational structure, although vary much more widely in size.
- **Edge cases:** A minority take to piracy or banditry; even then, crews tend to keep internal share-law and memory-debt obligations.

### Law, Charters & Governance

- **Why privileges matter:** A small, widely traveling people are vulnerable to abuse; collective memory and reputation deter predation.
- **Repercussions for abuse:** “Unsafe” towns lose halfling custom; economic boycotts, rumor-networks, and (among hardliners) targeted vengeance compel amends.
- **Internal order:** No central state; cohesion via kin networks, company charters, and ancestral-mind reputation.
- **External compacts:** Ancient charters, road compacts, and port treaties frequently guarantee passage across the realms of other species, protect caravans/wayhouses, and grant limited extraterritoriality to recognized freeholds (such as established inns).  
- **Sembara examples:** Royal-road movement and trade guaranteed; select inns recognized as **folkland**; a halfling **Royal Observer** attends the Royal Council with voice (no vote) on roads/rights (though last may not be canon). 
- **Enforcement norms:** Memory-debts and oaths sworn “to the road” enforced by reputation—oath-breakers denied hospitality or passage until restitution.

### Using Halflings in Play
- Trade networks: use halfling companies to move news, goods, and rumors across frontiers; a single family badge can recur across ports and roads.
- Memory‑debts: hooks where a favor owed to an ancestor is repaid—or called in—at an inconvenient moment; excellent leverage for intrigue without villains.
- Crossroads and inns: hubs for gathering parties, black‑market exchanges, and neutral‑ground parleys. Some freeholds operate outside ordinary manorial ties.
- Sea arcs: shanties, storms, and salvage; halfling crews make fine patrons, rivals, or employers for maritime adventures.
- Typical professions: as travelers driven by wanderlust, many halflings are traders, merchants, sailors, bards, and sometimes even pirates or bandits. Those who do settle often gravitate towards inns and taverns, and are frequently innkeepers. 

### Roleplaying Halflings
- Voice and bearing: warm, quick‑witted, and observant; direct in business, expansive in hospitality.
- Ethics: a deal kept is a reputation earned; generosity where it binds communities together; sharp memory for slights against kin or guests.
- Table mannerisms: spontaneous songs; toasts naming absent friends; quiet mind‑to‑mind “aside” between kin before answering a hard question.
- Vibes: halflings love stories, both the telling and the hearing. They have little use for material wealth, preferring not to accumulate more than they can comfortably carry with them, but will often value a few precious mementos highly. 
- As traders and merchants they seek unusual goods, whether rare magics or beautiful art or exotic spices. 
- They enjoy living life to its fullest no matter where they may be, and are eternal optimists even in dire times. 

### Conflicts and Open Questions
- Memory shrines: practice is described both as place‑based (natural overlooks, groves, hearths) and as memory‑network loci re‑experienced through the soulmind. Decide how overt or mystical this feels in play.
- Ships and crews: Western Gulf voyages feel like traveling clans; long‑sea routes resemble professional share‑crews. Calibrate how often families bring elders and children aboard outside the Gulf.
- Law and charters: scope of free‑movement treaties and folkland recognitions (especially in Sembara) varies by source; finalize the “Royal Observer” custom’s origin, term, and which family currently holds it.
- Halflings do not have a creation story or detailed metaphysics developed, though many ideas such as the ancestral mind exist. 
- Claim that halflings join the shared ancestral mind upon death - any implications for resurrection? Or should this be interpreted as some kind of metaphor/reflection of the divine realm of the First Ones?

### Brainstorming 
- Halflings perhaps experience time all at once somehow? As the "one song"? Think about how time flows for halflings
- Conclave of halflings to determine the song of the year
- Halflings count the days since time began, in a long cycle that repeats.
- Halfling gods connection to time -- the story of the years already exists and the telling is remembering in a sense; connection to firstborn, the “memories of the future”. Racial consciousness connects here too, perhaps somehow they can remember the future?
- **Creation Story:** The First Ones set halflings wandering so music, trade, and tales would bind the world; origins are preserved in songs and rites rather than foreign chronicles.
