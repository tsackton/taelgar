# Halflings

On roads and riverways, and in every harbor along the [[Green Sea]], halfling caravans and crews are a familiar sight. Most folk know them as cheerful traders and tireless sailors, quick with a song or a story and quicker still to strike a fair bargain. They travel in tight‑knit family companies, keep excellent inns at busy crossroads, and have a reputation for remembering favors—and settling them—even generations later. Halflings commonly speak mind‑to‑mind among themselves, and their storytellers are famed for carrying memories older than any living person.
## Appearance

Halflings are small and sturdy, usually 3 to 3½ feet tall, with a tendency toward a healthy stoutness and curly hair. Complexion often reflects the routes they travel—sailors and coastal traders are deeply tanned; inland caravanners vary widely. Practical garb is the norm: travel‑ready coats, trousers built for long walks, and a flash of color in a cloak or scarf.
## Language and Naming

Constant travel leaves most halflings comfortable in several tongues. Silent, mind‑to‑mind speech is ordinary among them; caravans and crews often confer in silence before answering difficult questions, and private matters are rarely spoken aloud. For dealings with others, halflings use the western trade tongue commonly called Common, and the Green Sea trade tongue across eastern ports; many act as interpreters between realms. Names usually pair a short given name with a distinctive family name—often a trade, place, or storied deed (e.g., Copperharp, Goodbarrel, Strongbones, Stonebridge). Family companies frequently adopt a shared badge, motto, or hallmark for their wares.

## Lifecycle

Halflings mature in their early twenties and commonly live about a century; a lucky few see longer. Families are broadly extended and communitarian in habit: caravans and Green Sea crews are kin companies first and businesses second, with apprentices, in‑laws, and the occasional foundling folded into the roll.
## Settlements and Homelands

Halflings claim no singular homeland. They settle among others—human towns, dwarven hill‑villages, and river hamlets—and thrive on the move: wagon caravans on the great roads, cogs and caravels on the Green Sea. Crossroads inns and market‑side yards run by halfling families are commonplace; a few such freeholds are old enough to be recognized as folkland in local law. Along the Green Sea, halfling flags are common in the Western Gulf between [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], and Sembaran ports; farther east, halfling crews run longer legs between [[Wahacha]] and the cold trading grounds near [[Praznitsky]].

On established routes, halfling‑kept inns act as wayhouses, mail drops, price boards, and lending libraries by route. Crews record commodity prices and hazards for kin behind them; in turn, a caravan’s gossip is often a town’s first news of the wider world. Sea companies tend toward a share system of pay and ownership, with a ship’s shares drifting over time as sailors age out and apprentices rise. Ships are sized for halfling crews—tight‑decked and efficient—with orders carried aloud but most one‑to‑one conversation left to mind‑speech.
## Cultural Traits

Hospitality, memory, and fair dealing define their public face. Travelers speak of halfling feasts and long evenings of song; merchants learn that debts of kindness may be repaid at surprising moments, and that word of treachery travels fast. Discipline aboard ship and loyalty within the company sit alongside an easy warmth with strangers who come in peace. Memory‑debts are honored even across generations; a favor owed by a great‑grandparent may be repaid in coin, bargain, or feast when a caravan next passes through [see: [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]].

Most halflings honor the First Ones—Nwana (the Stranger and Child), Obito (the Music‑Maker and Merchant), and Jemghari (the Storyteller and Wanderer)—through songs, toasts, and shared remembrance rather than temples. Shrines are often places of good memory: a favored overlook, a quiet grove off the trade road, the hearth of a well‑kept inn. Some memories themselves become “shrines,” layered and re‑experienced through the racial consciousness so that later generations recall not only the first moment, but also the telling of that moment by a famed story‑keeper. History‑bearers within each company serve as informal clergy, bearing and retelling the memories that bind kin together, marking beginnings and endings with prayers to remember well.

In law and custom, halflings often travel under ancient charters that grant free movement and limited extraterritorial rights. In Sembara, for instance, halflings maintain long‑standing treaties on passage and trade; some inns are recognized as folkland; and a halfling “Royal Observer” attends sessions of the Royal Council with voice but no vote, speaking to matters that touch halfling rights and roads.

## Historical Perspective

For generations, halfling companies and crews have tied distant ports and border towns together, carrying news and trade even in hard years. In the aftermath of the Great War and the unsettled years that followed, their caravans and cogs threaded the gaps, keeping markets supplied, stories alive, and distant kin in quiet conversation. Ballads collected as the [[Halfling Shanties of the Green Sea]] describe runs from Tollen’s dyes to kenku islands and the northern frostlands for dragonhide—routes that continue in the present day. Many of the oldest crossroads inns in Sembara and the Western Gulf trace their tenure to those years when halfling networks quietly held the world together.

## Details for DMs

### Where You’ll Find Them
- Green Sea trade: halfling crews and factors running dyes out of [[Tollen]], calling at kenku ports like [[Wahacha]], and ranging as far as the cold reaches around [[Praznitsky]]. See songs in [[Halfling Shanties of the Green Sea]].
- Overland routes: family caravans linking duchies and border towns; frequent presence at crossroads inns, river landings, and toll bridges.
- Integrated communities: halfling wards in mixed towns; folkland‑status inns that predate recent charters; small enclaves in dwarven hill country.

### Religion and Metaphysics
- The [[First Ones]]—Nwana, Obito, and Jemghari—anchor halfling belief. Formal temples are rare; shrines are often places of good memory and strong feeling.
- Halflings share an ancestral racial memory (often called the soulmind) and commonly communicate mind‑to‑mind. History‑bearers serve as keepers of story and rite. For mechanics and tone, see [[Playing a Halfing]].
- After death, memories are said to join the great halfling consciousness rather than linger as individual souls; priests claim this is why some memories feel “shared” among kin.

### Trade Practices and Institutions
- Route‑libraries and price boards at halfling wayhouses support route knowledge and commodity rate sharing across families.
- Guildhall‑style inns double as hiring posts, mail drops, and kin registries; caravans and ships post shares, crews, and routes.
- Risk management varies by region: caravans in the Western Gulf operate like generational communities; long‑sea routes use tighter crews, formal shares, and ad‑hoc mutual insurance among kin companies.

### Using Halflings in Play
- Trade networks: use halfling companies to move news, goods, and rumors across frontiers; a single family badge can recur across ports and roads.
- Memory‑debts: hooks where a favor owed to an ancestor is repaid—or called in—at an inconvenient moment; excellent leverage for intrigue without villains.
- Crossroads and inns: hubs for gathering parties, black‑market exchanges, and neutral‑ground parleys. Some freeholds operate outside ordinary manorial ties.
- Sea arcs: shanties, storms, and salvage; halfling crews make fine patrons, rivals, or employers for maritime adventures.

### Roleplaying Halflings
- Voice and bearing: warm, quick‑witted, and observant; direct in business, expansive in hospitality.
- Ethics: a deal kept is a reputation earned; generosity where it binds communities together; sharp memory for slights against kin or guests.
- Table mannerisms: spontaneous songs; toasts naming absent friends; quiet mind‑to‑mind “aside” between kin before answering a hard question.

### Conflicts and Open Questions
- Geographic spread in earlier eras: some notes emphasize halflings concentrated around the eastern Green Sea, while others imply wider early presence. Clarify how far west halfling sea‑lanes and caravans reached before modern times.
- Trade tongues: some discussions credit halflings with shaping the spread of Common; the languages overview frames Common as a human‑derived pidgin broadly adopted by halflings. Decide whether halfling influence was formative or primarily distributive.
 - Memory shrines: practice is described both as place‑based (natural overlooks, groves, hearths) and as memory‑network loci re‑experienced through the soulmind. Decide how overt or mystical this feels in play.
 - Ships and crews: Western Gulf voyages feel like traveling clans; long‑sea routes resemble professional share‑crews. Calibrate how often families bring elders and children aboard outside the Gulf.
 - Law and charters: scope of free‑movement treaties and folkland recognitions (especially in Sembara) varies by source; finalize the “Royal Observer” custom’s origin, term, and which family currently holds it.

## Metaphysics

Common belief holds that the First Ones keep halfling memories in trust and that halflings can share thoughts in silence; scholars debate how, priests call it a blessing, and most people simply accept that halflings remember what matters.

## Creation Story

Stories say the First Ones set halflings wandering with music, trade, and tales to bind the world together. Whether a single origin or many, the details are kept within their songs and rites rather than written in foreign books.

The whistle of the wind in the sails, on a ship crashing through the waves far from land. The clink of coin changing hands at the market. The crackle of the campfire and the smell of bacon and tomatoes sizzling after a long day of walking. The creak of a wagon lumbering to the next village, with a cheery tune emanating from within. Halflings love these things. A nomadic people who rarely settle in one place for long, halflings come and go with the rhythm of the seasons, making money, friends, or both along the way.

## Old Text
### Small and Charming

Halflings are short and stout, usually standing between 3 and 3 ½ feet tall and weighing between 40 and 50 pounds. Surrounded by larger races, they survive on their charm, and when that fails, their talent for quickly slipping out of sight. Halflings are quite variable in appearance, although all tend towards stoutness and curly hair. Those who ply the trade routes of the Inner Sea tend towards darker, deeply tanned complexions, while the merchants and travelers west of the mountains are paler and more likely to have blond or red hair. All halflings have bright eyes, usually green or hazel or brown. They favor practical clothing, made for traveling, although they are not above a few colorful flourishes; a halfling in a muted, sturdy clothes in browns and grays with a brightly colored cloak is not an uncommon sight.

Haflings live only slightly longer lives than humans. A halfling reaches adulthood around 20, and generally lives into to reach 100, but some lucky few live longer.

### Adaptable Communities

Halflings have no homeland of their own, and those who do settle down usually do so side-by-side with other races. Halfling communities can be found in dwarven villages high in the hills, small farming communities of humans, large cities full of diverse races, and even on the outskirts of the villages of the Lizardfolk. The occasional halfling village will grow up around a crossroads or sometimes a prominent tavern on the road, somewhere that will attract a steady stream of new travelers from outside. Halflings love a good tale, told in front of a roaring fire with hearty food and drink, and make excellent innkeepers for this reason.

Most halflings, however, simply never settle down. Whether they sail the [[Green Sea]], traveling from port to port, or wander the roads of Taelgar, small communities of halflings can be found moving from town to town, rarely staying more than a season or year in any one place. Welcomed wherever they go, but driven by wanderlust to avoid putting down roots, these communities trade stories and goods for company, food, and drink. They are generous and sharing, free with aid when they encounter travelers in need. They are also loyal to their companions, whether halfling or not, knowing that on the open road in a dangerous world, trust and loyalty can be all that keep you alive.

### Wanderers Connected

Living in small family groups usually apart from others of their race, halflings have no formal government or organized political structure. However, they remain connected to each other no matter how far apart via the collective memory of their ancestors, the halfling soulmind. This consciousness is central to halflings’ self conception as race. In significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals: they are also always part of this whole. Some halflings describe it as like waves on the ocean: individuals are patterns that arise, and come together, and move and come apart, distinct, but fundamentally part of one ocean. This conception of a shared soulmind, a shared racial consciousness, profoundly shapes their encounters with each other: that they're one single family, connected even if they haven't met.

This racial consciousness is guarded, watched over, and nurtured by the [[First Ones]], the Firstborn gods of the halflings: Nwana, the Stranger and Child; Obito, the Music Maker and Merchant; and Jemghari, the Storyteller and Traveler. While halflings do not have deep traditions of prayer, or organized religious practice, the First Ones are an ever-present backdrop to halfling life. Every experience, every memory of a halfling’s life will eventually contribute in some small way to the greater halfling consciousness, and for many halflings simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is all that is needed to pay homage to their creators.

### Sailors, Traders, Storytellers

As travelers driven by wanderlust, most halflings find themselves in professions that lend themselves to this lifestyle: traders, merchants, sailors, wandering bards, and sometimes even pirates or bandits. Natural sailors, ships crewed by halflings sail to far-away ports across the ocean and return with rare trade goods and unbelievable tales. Halflings love stories, both the telling and the hearing. They have little use for material wealth, preferring not to accumulate more than they can comfortably carry with them, but will often value a few precious mementos highly. As traders and merchants they seek unusual goods, whether rare magics or beautiful art or exotic spices. They enjoy living life to its fullest no matter where they may be, and are eternal optimists even in dire times.

Halflings are also noted musicians and bards and storytellers. Halfling artists and musicians, in particular, tend to embrace the notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- which mirrors halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness. Halfling music is usually improvisational because of this, and, in Taelgar, they are the originators of jazz and related musical traditions.njoy living life to its fullest no matter where they may be, and are eternal optimists even in dire times.

Halfling ship notes - not sure where else to put for now:

Halfling ships are organized like large halfling caravans. Usually, members of the clan that owns the ship make up at least half the crew, and fill most, although often not all, the officer positions. The rest of the crew is often made up of various individuals with their own reasons for travel: children of sedentary halflings who want adventure, or land-based clans that want to experience the sea; survivors of shipwrecks and other disasters; partners of the main clan; and other idiosyncratic folks.

Profits of the journey are usually split evenly, after the needs o the ship have been taken care of, although typically excess funds are retained in a ship's account and paid out based on time served on departure of a crew member, or to their clan on death. Purchases with ship funds are typically agreed by majority vote, and all halflings who are part of the crew share equally, and are treated as family.

### History

Halflings don’t record their history; they remember it. The tale of years is told, and told again, created and recreated by the history-tellers and story keepers of each generation, and then recalled as their memories join the racial awareness when they pass on from their individual lives. This living relationship to history means that years are not numbered and dated from fixed points in time. Instead, halflings refer to the song of years and the sagas of eras to mark their history. However, these tellings are held close to the halfling race, and they use more standard reckoning of dates when talking with the outside world.

For halflings, remembering their history and the worship of the First Ones are deeply connected. History-bearers, those who are especially deeply connected to the racial memory through long practice, tell stories of the past, and often dedicate themselves to composing a great story or song as their life’s work. These songs become the songs of years -- some spanning eras, others a single year. While few know the full song of years, the history-bearers and their connection to the racial mind are part of the fabric of halfling culture and ensure that the old stories are not forgotten.

### Culture

As reflected in the nature of the First Ones, much of Halfling identity is based around encounter with other. Halflings are wanderers and the traders, seeking outward-facing encounters with other communities and races and cultures. They are also storytellers and musicians, inward-facing bearers of cultural history and identity, and the keepers of the secret halfling language, not taught to outsiders.

As people always on the road, halflings have a very expansive notion of family and hospitality, at least among their own kind. One halfing can always expect to share another’s camp and companionship, and notions of the obligations of hospitality to fellow halflings are deeply ingrained in their culture.

The traditions of hospitality are in part as strong as they are because of the reality of the halfling racial consciousness. Although the First Ones are centrally important in halfling life and culture, much of their centrality arises from their role as the guardians, shapers, keepers, and ultimately creators of the halfling soulmind, the joint racial consciousness of all halflings. This consciousness is central to halflings’ self conception as race. In significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals: they are also always part of this whole. Some halflings describe it as like waves on the ocean: individuals are patterns that arise, and come together, and move and come apart, distinct, but fundamentally part of one ocean. This conception of a shared soulmind, a shared racial consciousness, profoundly shapes their encounters with each other: that they're one single family, connected even if they haven't met. It's not a belief in personal reincarnation, exactly, but it's a different sort of relationship with death to have that sense of how individual and collective meet.

Halfling art and culture embraces the idea that permanent and unchanging things get expressed in unique and changing forms, that the journey, the next step, is always different, and even the same road changes with the seasons and years. They do not build much in the way of permanent structures, and their art does not seek to create artificial perfection. Instead, they see an embrace of imperfection is more reflective of life-as-it-is than something artificially made to be perfect.

Halflings are noted musicians and bards and storytellers. Halfling artists and musicians, in particular, tend to embrace the notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- which mirrors halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness. Halfling music is usually improvisational because of this, and, in Taelgar, they are the originators of jazz and related musical traditions.

### Magic

Halfling magical traditions draw heavily on the embodied power of the First Ones and the halfling soulmind. Because of this, halflings are drawn to magic focused on on telepathy, charm, communication, and illusion; as a general matter halfling magic is subtle and halflings that embrace flashy wizard magic are rare, although not unheard of.

### Law

#### For Outsiders

Halflings have no homeland, and spend most of their lives traveling through and across the lands of others. As they are small people, noted more for their good nature and quick feet than any strength in arms, if a community of larger, stronger folks decides to rob or kill them, there is often little they can do in the moment.

However, it is hard to get away with murder when the memories of those you kill don’t end with their death, and halflings are deeply concerned with righting those of their kind that are wronged. While most halflings tend towards nonviolence themselves, those that don’t often justify their actions as vengeance and retribution for those of their kind that were wronged.

Between the risk of a quiet dagger and the possibility of economic retribution, most human communities tend to treat halflings well, and give them legal privileges others don’t have. Rumors of places it is not safe to go spread quickly through the halfling community, and these places soon find themselves with no halfling caravans willing to bring goods to market there, or buy goods to take to market elsewhere.
