# Celestials

Celestials is a broad term, used to describe the manifested representatives of divine beings on the Material Plane by many cultures and peoples across Taelgar. There is much disagreement, however, about the exact nature of these beings, and few reliable reports of their nature. Most encounters with celestials suggest they often take on characteristics of the divinities they represent or are created by.

Some basic metaphysics:

Without taking a position on the reality of various metaphysical and cosmological debates recorded in the Cosmology chapter, the natives of the so-called Spiritual Realms are clearly distinct from the natives of other planes. In particular, these creatures are fundamentally unkillable outside their native plane, as they are made of soulstuff and return to their native realm when killed outside it (though weaker beings may not necessarily have the coherence to remember 'past lives' in anything but the most abstract sense).

(As an aside, there is still a bit of metaphysical thinking to do about what distinguishes natives of the spiritual realms from souls of the dead, who also presumably inhabit spiritual realms; and from incorporeal undead, who are the souls of the dead that remain bound to the material plane.)

(As a second aside, there is also more thinking to do about the extent to which natives of inner realms that are not the material plane have souls a metaphysical "soulstuff" sense.)

However, this distinction does not neatly map to D&D creature types, which does not have a consistent creature type for natives of the Outer Planes (e.g., fiends and celestials exist as creature types, but natives of Limbo are Aberrations, natives of Mechanus are Constructs, etc).

Celestials as a word and a category feels like it definitely exists in-world, to describe effectively angels, but how this relates mechanically to D&D rules is not yet clear to me.
