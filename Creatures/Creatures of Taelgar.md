# Creatures of Taelgar

The multiverse is home to a diverse array of sentient and sometimes sapient creatures, from the mundane beasts that inhabit the Material Plane to the terrifying demon lords of the Abyss. While the full tale of all the strange creatures one might encounter traveling across the world and the many planes of existence is extensive, this brief bestiary gives an overview of the types of intelligent and not-so-intelligent creatures one might expect to encounter. 

Nearly all sentient creatures attract and accrete an ineffable substance, usually called [[Soulstuff]], that is part of the fundamental essence of the multiverse and is drawn to sentience. Those rare few who have traveled to the [[Plane of Souls|Plane of Consciousness]] report that these sparks of soulstuff look like vast, complex fields of ever-changing stars when viewed away from their material forms. Human religions teach that the gods gift some of their infinite soulstuff to humans on birth, and this gifted soulstuff is what lingers after death, to make the journey across the [[Land of the Dead]] back to the [[Divine Realms]] beyond; many non-human religions teach a version of this story, as well. The metaphysical truth of these teachings is not clear. 

## Common Species of the Material Plane

The term species is used to refer to sapient creatures who have a single point of creation, a shared history, language, and potentially diverse cultures. There are fourteen common species native to the Material Plane, which nearly anyone will have heard tales of at some point or another, although only the most cosmopolitan and well-traveled people will have met more than a few. 

Eight species make up the vast majority of adventurers in the world, and while they might be rare in human cities, would generally be welcomed:

- [[Humans]], the most numerous species on Taelgar, who live in all corners of the world have created diverse cultures, religions, and language;
- [[Dwarves]], a stout and hardy people created by the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]] and carving mighty kingdoms out of stone among and beneath the great mountains of the world;
- [[Elves]], a graceful and elegant people created by [[Elmerca]], the Wild Star, and [[Aldanor]], the living tree, who once maintained vast kingdoms beneath magical trees, but now are rarely seen;
- [[Halflings]], a nimble, diminuitive people created by the [[First Ones]]; storytellers, travelers, merchants, and traders; who wander the world in caravans and ships making friends and leaving stories wherever they go; 
- [[Lizardfolk]], a species of humanoid reptiles, created by the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], who tend their wetlands homes under the guidance of elders and ancestors;
- [[Stoneborn]], created by [[Entamba]] who they call the living mountain, who take on the appearance of the stones of their mountain homes, settling in inhospitable heights;
- [[Kenku]], the flying bird people sometimes seen soaring above the cities of the northern Green Sea; who live in reclusive aeries in the northern Green Sea, keeping their secret history to themselves;
- [[Centaurs]], half-human, half-horse, who wander the world in great, slow migrations spanning years or decades, calling themselves the protectors of the world;

Two species are often considered to be pests and nuisances by humans, though rarely attacked on sight; they often live on the edge of the lands of other species, and occasionally turning to banditry: 

- [[Kobolds]], a species of diminutive dragon-like humanoids, assumed to be related to dragons in some way, often living in complex warrens of tunnels on the outskirts of human realms;
- [[Goblins]], a species of small tricksters, who are rarely seen except when they turn to banditry, and largely remain hidden when they settle near human lands;

Two species are frequently the implacable enemies of humans and their allies and friends, and might often be attacked on sight in human cities:

- [[Hobgoblins]], who made up the bulk of [[Cha'mutte]]'s armies in the [[Great War]], and in the years after conquered significant portions of southern Sembara and the region north of Chardon; who have a reputation for slavery and authoritarian rule over the regions they conquer;
- [[Orcs]], the creations of [[Thark]], stripped of their will by [[Thark]]'s power and forced into endless war, fighting each other as often as other species; but occasionally rising in great hosts that threaten the lands of humans and other species; 

Two species are feared and respected in equal measure, often seen as relics of ancient powers from days of myth and legend: 

- [[Dragons]], flying reptilian monsters of vast power and intelligence, terrifying to face in combat and devasting when they turn their wrath on the settlements of other species;
- [[Giants]], larger than life humanoids who can reach heights of 20 feet or more, who tend to remain on the margins of society and often settle inhospitable lands; even the smallest giant commands respect from any but the most powerful who might challenge it;  

## Other Natives of the Material Plane

A wide range of other creatures inhabit the Material Plane. Many of these are simply mundane beasts, with no supernatural connections or magical powers, who make up the diverse ecosystems across the world. Others are more monstrous and dangerous; and stories even hint of strange species in the far reaches of the world. 


## Natives of Other Planes

The world of Taelgar is populated by many sentient species. All sentient species in Taelgar were created, in some way, by magic, usually by the direct intervention of a deity.  

The first sentient beings on Taelgar were the [[Children of the Riving]]. The [[Divine Presence]] created the [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Elementals]], and [[Giants]] in the mythic age before even the [[Elder Folk]] walked the earth. Imbued with powerful magic, these creatures dominated the world in the early days of creation, when magic was strong and the various planes of existence still intertwined with the [[Material Plane]]. 

While many of the descendants of these powerful beings now dwell outside the [[Material Plane]], there are exceptions. [[Dragons]], [[Elementals]], and [[Giants]] feature regularly in tales of adventure; while most common folk have never personally encountered these powerful creatures, they are the heroes and villains of many tales. The [[Centaurs]], descended from the first [[Fey]], claimed Taelgar as their home long ago, and are now rarely found in the [[Feywild]]. Many other [[Fey]], though not native to the material plane, are frequent visitors to Taelgar. And the diminutive trickster [[Kobolds]], created by powerful [[Dragons]] in days long past, can still be found in various corners of the world. 

The Divine Beings also created the Embodied Gods, who were shaped from divine energy, given physical form, permanence and consciousness, and the power to create. These Firstborn created the [[Elder Folk]] in their image, who draw power and magic from the mystical connection they share with their creator gods. They are the [[Elves]], [[Dwarves|Dwarves]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Lizardfolk]], and [[Halflings]]

Some Embodied Gods were not created by the Divine Beings, but instead came into existence through the corruption of the Undivine, the Void Mind, a malevolent force dedicated to emptiness, the undoing of creation itself. These evil gods are responsible for the [[Orcs]], [[Lycanthropes|the curse of lycanthropy]], and [[Undead]], as well as many monstrosities that roam the land. The [[Goblinoids]] are also the creations of the Undivine, made as servants of the forces that seek to undo creation. 

The [[Humans]], the most numerous sentient species on Taelgar, were created by the Divine Beings themselves, and gifted the divine spark. Through the prayers, curses, hopes, and fears of humanity, the Incorporeal Gods and the [[Extraplanar Natives]], the fiends, celestials, and other creatures of [[Divine Realms]], were imagined into being.

Scattered across Taelgar are also more [[Unusual Species]], with diverse and strange histories. These includes the [[Gnomes]], rumored to be distant relatives of the dwarves; the flying [[Kenku]] who live in secretive homes in the north and do not share their creation story with outsiders; and the various aquatic and semi-aquatic [[Merfolk]] who inhabit the oceans, swamps, and rivers of Taelgar, rarely interacting with the surface worlds; and the Creatures of the [[Far Realms]], with alien goals and strange powers. 

What other sentient beings may live in the far corners of the world, deep underground or across the oceans, remains a mystery. 



## The Fey

Of all the many planes in the multiverse, the [[Feywild]] is by far the most accessible from, and connected to, the material world. Travelers cross into, and out of, the Feywild at portals scattered around Taelgar, and visitors from the Feywild are, if not a common sight, relatively unsurprising. The people of the Feywild are diverse, magical, and strange; those that are playable species options in Taelgar are detailed below. 

****Satyrs***: Goat-legged humanoids with a reputation for mirth and merriment, satyrs are among the most common denizens of the Feywild encountered in Taelgar. While it is the rare satyr that settles in the cities of humans or other species, lone satyrs making music or mischief, or groups traveling together in a moveable feast, are not an infrequent sight on the quieter roads and backwoods of the world. 

****Changelings***: Humanoids imbued with the changeable essence of the Feywild, changelings are able  to shift their appearance and voice at will, residing in many societies undetected. For some changelings, each new face is only a mask, a disguise to be cast off when no longer needed; for others, a new face may be a window into a new facet of their soul. 

****Fae***: The fae are the most common natives of the Feywild, graceful humanoids with an elfin appearance and a striking presence. Common sights in the courts of the archfey and across the settled regions of the Feywild, the fae rarely leave their native plane for the material world. Away from the Feywild, the inner presence of the magic of the archfey is dimmed, and the fae might be mistaken for a particularly graceful human, or perhaps an elf. 

****Beastfolk***: Scattered through the realms of the Feywild are the beastfolk: bipedal animal-like fey that typically resemble humanoid versions of the animals they mimic. The beastfolk rarely leave the Feywild, for when they do, they risk being mistaken for talking animals, monstrosities, or worse. 

****Fairies***: Diminutive fairies, small flying fey of which sprites and pixies are the most well known, commonly cross the boundaries of the worlds, to make mischief or bring joy, but are rarely seen by humans or other big folk unless they wish to be spotted. Many human superstitions of the fey trace their origin to the actions of the fairies. 

## Unusual Species

Legends and rumors speak of other, stranger species in the world of Taelgar. Sailors tell tales of merfolk who live beneath the waves, dwarves mutter about the brain-eating mind flayers that hide deep underground, and legends speak of larger than life giants who build massive fortresses with ancient magic. Few of these species are playable options in Taelgar, but three exceptions are detailed below. These options are not appropriate for all campaigns, and people of these species will often be greeted with fear, suspicious, and disbelief.
