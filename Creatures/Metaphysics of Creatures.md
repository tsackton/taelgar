# Metaphysics of Creatures

The multiverse of Taelgar contains a diverse array of self-aware creatures. This documents some metaphysics and worldbuilding about how different types of creatures are different.

This is a companion to [[Creature Rules in Taelgar]], which contains more explicit discussion of how to integrate these metaphysics with D&D rules. 

## Fundamental Supernatural Forces

There are two fundamental supernatural forces in the multiverse that make Taelgar the magical place it is: soulstuff and magic. 

### Soulstuff
The foundation of sentience on Taelgar is [[Soulstuff]], an ineffable part of the multiverse. There is no clear definition or decision on what soulstuff is, but there are some fundamental principles about it that drive worldbuilding:

* Soulstuff accretes to self-aware and perceiving creatures, meaning that (with some narrow exceptions) all creatures with motives and awareness have soulstuff
* Soulstuff has "flavors", typically associated with some plane of existence or a divinity. So "feywild" or "elven" soulstuff is not directly and exactly interchangeable with "abyssal" or "orcish" soulstuff. This can, but won't always, drive cultural traits and similarities.
* Soulstuff is powerful: beings with strong soulstuff (high CR monsters, PCs, divinities) can create supernatural effects from their own internal essence
* Soulstuff is connected is the medium by which the dead retain their essence to be brought back to life. 
### Magic
Magic is a fundamental part of Taelgar as well, and is ultimately sourced from the [[Plane of Magic]].  What magic is is not defined, but it has some principles as well:

* Magic and soulstuff are not the same thing, though there exact relationship is not clear (see note below)
* Magic is impersonal - there is no "fire magic" or "elven magic" in the way that soulstuff can be associated with the Plane of Fire or the elven divinities
* The locus of magic is the Plane of Magic, although the mechanism by which it permeates other planes is not clear (note: this has something to do with ley lines, see [[Ley Lines]] for some in-world speculation and some DM notes)

%% Unclear: is Magic and Soulstuff in opposition? Do divinities use magic, or does soulstuff replace magic? %%
## Creatures

With this background, self-aware creatures can broadly be divided into seven categories:

* True species: these are creatures with a unique culture and language, and continuity across the world. There might be many different human, dragon, or kenku cultures, but they share an evolution, common history, and overarching narrative. Everything in this category should have the potential for a story for how it came to be. 
- Creatures of the inner planes: creatures of matter and magic in some proportion that are sentient and accrete soulstuff over their lifetime because of this sentience
- Creatures of the outer planes: creatures of pure soulstuff, manifesting a body via the magic of their soulstuff. These creatures cannot be killed except on their native planes 
- Creatures of the Far Realms: visitors from the Far Realms, who lack Taelgarian soulstuff. These creatures have diverse metaphysical reality, and some Far Realms creatures may be best treated as true species.
- Constructs: creatures that are not really thinking creatures at all, but are animated by some magic which mimics sentience. They do not have souls at all
- Transformations: creatures corrupted or transformed during life or after death into a new form. 
- Divinities: creature that have accreted enough soulstuff (via their own powerful essence or gift from elsewhere) that they have transcended the usual mortality 

### True Species

These are the unique species of Taelgar, the creaures with a common culture, history, language and creation story. A true species is distinguished by:

* A single creation story (or the potential for one) - these never just sprung up from the essence of a plane
* A common relationship to soulstuff. True species could have no souls (hobgoblins), gifted souls (humans), or souls tied to a plane (fae), but each individual member of a true species shares a source of soulstuff and the details of the soulstuff of a true species should be invented.
* A life after death (usually). In most cases, the soulstuff of a true species should have some vehicle for lingering after death, although this is not always true
* Existence in the Inner Realms. All true species are native to the Inner Realms. 

Each true species should have a detailed Species page, and most - but not all - are playable by PCs. In general, new true species should be discussed and new inventions here should be quite rare. 

Species can be further divided based their metaphysics, into three broad categories: species that are gifted soulstuff from divinities; species that accrete soulstuff from their native plane; and species that lack soulstuff. 
#### Gifted Soulstuff
Most common playable species of Taelgar are gifted soulstuff by a Deity. This category includes humans, elves, dwarves, lizardfolk, stoneborn, halflings, and orcs. Standard in-world knowledge about cosmology and the metaphysics of souls is typically reported from the perspective of these species, and may reflect a biased or limited understanding of reality. 

 [[Humans]], who are created directly by the Divine Presence, native to the Material Plane, and gifted soulstuff upon birth which returns to divine realms beyond the [[Land of the Dead]] upon death. 

[[Dwarves]], [[Elves]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Halflings]], and [[Lizardfolk]] are referred to as the Elder Folk, and are all created by embodied gods often referred to as the firstborn of their species. These species, like humans, are gifted soulstuff upon birth which returns to the realms of their embodied creators beyond the [[Land of the Dead]] upon death. 

[[Orcs]] are created by Thark, who is metaphysically similar to the firstborn of the Elder Folk, but is a creation of the Three Despairs / Void Mind. Orcs, like the Elder Folk and humans, are gifted soulstuff by Thark, which returns to Thark upon death. 

*Open Questions and Discussion*
- The term "Elder Folk" is occasionally used to refer to the non-orc children of embodied gods, but it is not clear whether this is a meta term or an in-world term. If it is an in-world term, we might consider whether it is too Tolkien-esque. 
- What exactly are embodied gods? The only canonical thing that distinguishes them from Incorporeal gods is that their power independent of belief (so if all the elves died Aldanor and Elmerica would still exist). The naming "Embodied Gods" to me implies they might have a physical existence, e.g. be a combination of matter and soulstuff. But this is not well developed, and it might be worth considering fleshing out categories of divinity a little better. 
- There is clearly something different about orcs that is more extreme in some way that the normal "firstborn connection" type vibe, though whether this needs a clear metaphysical explanation or can simply derive from Thark's nature is not obvious (but might impinge on what happens to Riswynn's quest). 
- Are humans gifted soulstuff by a divinity? If so, how does one change religion? If not, do humans acquire soulstuff from the Divine Presence and/or the Plane of Creation directly? Or through the mediation of a divinity? How is this related to the [[Divine Spark]]? 
- Note that the nature of the "gift of soulstuff" has to be flexible enough to allow Dewalth (elf who channels soulstuff from human gods) metaphysically possible. 

#### Accrete Soulstuff
Some playable species, and many classic fantasy species, especially those who can potentially reach vast heights of power, do not receive soulstuff from divinities, but instead accrete it as it typical for non-species creatures. 

[[Giants]] and [[Dragons]] are natives of the Material Plane, but their origin stories are connected in some as-yet-to-be-decided way to the [[Primordial Cosmos]] and the pre-[[Riving]] history of the world. Both of these species have the ability to accrete very large quantities of soulstuff, and potentially accrete soulstuff from more than one plane. If giants or dragons worship deities, they almost certainly worship what would metaphysically be something like demigods of their species who accreted sufficient soulstuff to trancend normal mortality. 

[[Fae]] and [[Fairies]] are the native species of the Feywild, collectively referred to as [[Fey]]. These species do not have a clear origin story, but canonically accrete Feywild soulstuff, and likely have no deities. Archfey might function something like divinities metaphysically, but not culturally, though exactly what archfey are remains an open question. 

[[Centaurs]] are native to the Material Plane; their origin myths speak of their close connection to the Material Plane. They do not worship gods, except the Material Plane itself as a kind of embodiment of divinity and creation. 

*Open Questions and Discussion:*
- Dragons and giants share the properties of coming in different "flavors", often elemental-associated and having the potential to be very powerful. One possible in-world explanation for this is that these species, as they were created before the Riving, maintain some ability to accrete soulstuff from more than one plane. So a red dragon has both material plane soulstuff and plane of fire soulstuff, for example. This could potentially be a common property of both creatures and species that have some pre-Riving connection, though it seems unlikely there would be other species worth introducing that have this property (but might work for other high-CR monstrosities). 
- [[Fae]] is not a great name for the non-fairy species native to the Feywild, as it is better to reserve Fey for the general creature type, including both species and non-species creatures native to the Feywild. Fairies are also not necessarily the best name. There also might need to be a name for [[Fae]] + [[Fairies]] that isn't [[Fey]], if [[Fey]] includes non-species creatures as well. 
- The Fey species could potentially use an origin story, although this is likely tied up in how the Feywild was created, which is probably but not definitely as part of the Riving. 
- [[Centaurs]] have a clear mythology and vibe about their origin as the first species of the Material Plane that claims they were the "children of Taelgar" in some sense. This seems clearly to link them directly to soulstuff of the Material Plane, but needs a little thought for the metaphysics of how they came to exist. Early invention had them as originating as children of the archfey, but this depends on a no-longer-relevant conception of the [[Primordial Cosmos]] as being inhabited by archfey who created many things. 

#### Lack Soulstuff
Only a small number of species in Taelgar truly lack soulstuff. Besides hobgoblins, only constructs and natives of the Far Realm are likely to be in the category, and constructs are generally not expected to be species. 

[[Hobgoblins]] are the creations of the [[Void Mind]], created to lack or perhaps even repel soulstuff. They do not worship gods, and do not accrete soulstuff despite being sapient. 

#### Unknown
These species are canonically species, but their metaphysics are unclear for various reasons. 

[[Merfolk]] were created by the [[Sentient Ocean]], which is a native inhabitant of a Far Realm, which it fled. However, they were created on Taelgar. This is probably compatible with either "Lack Soulstuff" or "Accrete Soulstuff" depending on the exact details of this story. 

[[Kobolds]] have no invention at all around their creation story or metaphysics, except that is presumably has something to do with dragons. Either "Accrete Soulstuff" or "Gifted Soulstuff" are possible, although the former is more likely. The latter likely requires that kobolds are the creation of some ancient draconic entities that accreted so much power as to become gods themselves. 

[[Kenku]] were canonically created by, more or less, a time paradox that involved [[Aerin]] traveling to the [[Primordial Cosmos]] and becoming the "Kenku firstborn." This could plausibly mean Kenku are gifted soulstuff by Aerin in some manner, or could mean that Kenku accrete soulstuff. The latter seems more likely, but this is not determined canonically. 

[[Goblins]] have no invention at all around their creation story or metaphysics and really any answer is plausible here. 

*Open Questions and Discussion:*
- Goblinoids no longer exist as a category, yet hobgoblins and goblins share very similar names. It feels like there should be some in-world explanation for this, although what that is is not yet clear to me. It is also possible that there is a real connection, yet to be invented, between goblins and hobgoblins in the goblin creation story. 
#### Tentative Species
These are creatures that either definitely exist in game, but might not be species; or creatures that are definitely species but might not exist in game. 

[[Gnomes]] are a longstanding invention, arising from the sundering of the dwarves pre-Downfall, but have never come up in play, even in rumor, and so don't canonically need to exist. If they do exist, though, it seems most likely they would be considered a separate species that arose via a transformation of the dwarves; but potentially these could metaphysically just be dwarves, with a different statblock. 

[[Ithilids]] definitely exist, but whether they are species or not is unclear. Most likely they are, as there are a variety of threads of invention around ithilids as one of the major forces in the depths below attacking dwarves, but conceivably they could be repeat invaders from some Far Realm where the creatures are just like this. 

[[Aboleths]] definitely exist, and might be considered species. They have a very different Far Realms vibe than ithilids and are likely from a different place, but they are rare on the Material Plane and so might also be better represented as occasional invaders and not really species. 

[[Bullywugs]] canonically exist, and have villages and language, but they have no canonically history. It is equally plausible that they are a 'nuisance species', like kobodls and goblins, who typically live at the margins of other species territories, or they are creatures that arise in various ways, more like manticores than kobolds. I lean towards species (three nuisance species -- kobolds, goblins, and bullwugs -- seems like a good number), but this is undeveloped for the moment. 

[[Dragonets]] canonically exist, and have a history tied to Drankor and possibly Hkar and a symbiotic relationship with humans. Whether they should be treated as a species, or as intelligent creatures with a unique and interesting population on the circular island is deeply unclear. The relationship between dragonets and dragons is also somewhat unclear. 

[[Djinn]], [[Marid]], [[Efreeti]], [[Dao]], and [[Azer]] all canonically exist as natives of the Elemental Planes, and other natives of the Elemental Planes likely exist as well that have not yet been developed. However, there is no invention at all around species on the Elemental Planes, and white it is likely that some or all of these best fit as species, it is at least plausible that some or all of them are better considered creatures who are personifications of their planes. 

### Creatures of the Inner Planes

These are the large category of creatures - often monsters - who exist to provide interesting adventures and stories, but who do not represent a meaningful cultures. Typically these creatures have at least the possibility of diverse metaphysical origins. While these creatures may be intelligent, they would usually be thought of as having an "ecology" instead of a "culture", and shouldn't have a history. This includes everything from mundane beasts to classic monstrosities to gargantuan world-changing forces of nature. 

### Creatures of the Outer Planes

Creatures native to the spiritual realms are made of pure soulstuff, manifesting a body when they leave their native realms by the magic of their soulstuff. These creatures are intrinsic to their plane of origin, and their origin story should almost always be tied to the origin story of their native plane. These are not species in the sense above: though demons might have fundamental traits they share, and common stories and vibes, their is no demon culture that is separable from the "culture" of the Abyss. A notable feature of these creatures is they cannot be permanently destroyed except on their native plane. 

### Creatures of the Far Realms

Visitors from one of the many Far Realms, conceptually places that are outside the multiverse of Taelgar. These creatures - as they arise from outside the multiverse - lack Taelgarian soulstuff. These creatures have diverse metaphysical reality but have no soul to restore after death. Note that some Far Realms creatures may be considered species, if they have established a lasting presence in the multiverse. 

### Constructs

Some creatures are animated and given a facsimile of sentience via magic. These creatures are not really thinking creatures at all, in the metaphysical sense. They do not have souls, do not accrete soulstuff, and are rendered inanimate when killed, unless some magic restores them. Classic examples of this type are golems and animated objects, but this category can potentially include anything explicitly created and given sentience by magic alone. 

### Transformations

Many creatures are transformations of something else. This is a large category that includes a diverse array of curses, corruptions, and more benign transformations. Undead and lycanthropes are classic examples of transformations, but this category can also include things like supernatural corruption (medusas, gnolls) or magical experimentation (slave creatures created by mind flayers to serve them).

### Divinities

*See [[Divinities and Powers - Discussion]] for some discussion of this concept.*

Divinities are unique creatures that have accreted enough soulstuff (via their own powerful essence or gift from elsewhere) that they have transcended the usual mortality. There is a wide range of power levels and metaphysics of divinities on Taelgar that needs further invention. 

While the most obvious category of divinity are the deities associated with worship, this is not the only kind of divinity. In particular, it is worth considering whether a creature that has a name and a unique history, and is intended to be functionally immortal, might be better described as a divinity. Humans who transcended normal mortality, such as Beryl and Bhishma, are also examples of divinities. 

The fundamental defining feature of a divinity, though, is that it is singular. There is no "species" of deities, or archfey, or demon lords, or whatever. Each is a singular entity with its own creation story, albeit one potentially tied to a pantheon or group of similar entities.
