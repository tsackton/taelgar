Lizardfolk, humanoid reptilian inhabitants of swamps, rivers, and other similar habitats, shape their aquatic homes into rich, highly productive ecosystems, teeming with abundant life and food among their simple, often semi-aquatic, dwellings. Lizardfolk can be found across Taelgar, though rarely in arid lands. Many lizardfolk live apart from the societies of other species, preferring to keep to the traditions of their own kind. Other lizardfolk settle near human settlements, existing symbiotically with them and sometimes keeping close ties to their human neighbors, though typically living apart and not integrating fully. 

Lizardfolk culture is shaped by the elders, who guide lizardfolk societies, ensuring that fertility and population growth remain balanced with the rhythms of the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] and the needs and capabilities of the land. Through their gods, the [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], many lizardfolk have a deep connection to prophecy and dreams, and ties to the spirits of their ancestors that some lizardfolk can call upon for aid in times of need.

## Creating Your Lizardfolk Character

When you create your lizardfolk character, you might want to consider your relationship to your elders and ancestors. Many lizardfolk villages and societies are strongly shaped by the elders, and the spirits of the ancestors, who guide villages to ensure that growth is balanced with what the land can provide. This means that most lizardfolk societies are places of ample food and leisure, but where decisions about children are controlled collectively. If you grew up in such a place, did you leave your home with the blessing of the elders or ancestors? Against their wishes? Or are they uninvolved in your journey? You might also consider whether you grew up in a place isolated from other species, or a place close to humans or others. Or maybe you grew up someone atypical for lizardfolk; if so, how did that impact your character?

A simple answer if the engaging with the lore of lizardfolk is not of interest might be that you are from a town or village close to human settlement, perhaps in [[Greater Sembara]] or [[Greater Chardon]] as appropriate for your campaign, and that you left your home neither with the blessing and guidance of the elders of your village, nor against their wishes, but simply to find your own path. 

### Lizardfolk Names

Lizardfolk in Taelgar typically have a single given name, with the name of their home village or a physical descriptor serving as a second name when needed. Lizardfolk are often named after favored ancestors, so names tend to repeat across generations and often have some meaning in family lore or history. Some lizardfolk believe that some fragment of an ancestor is reborn into a new generation; because of this believe typically names are not repeated within generations, only across generations. 

To chose a name for your lizardfolk character, you might consider using one of the names below or inventing your own, which might not follow typical lizardfolk naming practice. 

**Male Names:** Arran, Aitor, Arzhider, Benat, Eneko, Ganiz, Ilari, Itzal, Mattin, Samso, Zorion, Zuzen   

**Female Names:** Alasne, Amaya, Arrosa, Elixane, Iara, Irati, Joska, Leire, Maialen, Naiara, Nerea, Ximenia, Xuxa

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium (roughly 5-7 feet tall)
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Lizardfolk reach adulthood in their late teens; the first 5-8 years of their life are spent as amphibious young. Though they reach old age in their 70s or 80s, most live as elders into their second century, though few reach 200 years. 
**Languages**: You may select four [[languages]] during character creation, which should usually include Lizardfolk and Common. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Lizardfolk Traits

As an Lizardfolk, you have these special traits.

#### Aquatic Adaptations
You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 30 minutes at at time.

#### Natural Armor
You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

#### Omens of the Ancestors
You can reach your ancestors through the magic of the Tharzen Anzinakoa and beseech them for aid. You always have the Augury spell prepared. You can cast each spell you gain with this trait once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

#### Prophetic Vision
Your affinity for the dreamworld allows you to briefly see a moment ahead in time. If you fail a d20 Test, you can roll 1d4 and add the result to the d20, potentially changing a failure into a success. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses after a Long Rest.

#### Ancestral Aid
When you reach character level 3, you can beseech your ancestors for aid using one of the options below (choose the option each time you use this feature). Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

- _**Ancestral Knowledge.**_ As an Action, you call upon the knowledge of your ancestors. You gain Proficiency with one Skill or Tool of your choice. This proficiency lasts for 1 hour. 

- _**Ancestral Protectors.**_ As a Bonus Action, you call upon your ancestors to protect you. For 1 minute, ancestral spirits flit about you in a 10 foot Emanation. At the end of each of your turns, you can cause these spirits to inflict Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus to all creatures of your choice within the Emanation, and the area of the Emanation is Difficult Terrain for your Enemies. 

- _**Ancestral Tongues.**_ As an Action, you call upon the words of your ancestors. For 1 hour, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts. If you attempt to Influence them, you have Advantage on the d20 Test.

### Status

**Lore**: vibes feel fairly complete; general settlement pattern and place in the world is complete. vibe of "shape their landscape to make very high productivity ecosystems" seems to fit well. some cultural details about view of the land are only well captured in [[Land Holding in Sembara]] but should be better explored more widely. history / ancient lizardfolk swamp might not be well captured in notes. 

**Religion**: undeveloped, other than names there is not much sense of lizardfolk religion.

**Unique Biology**: a little underdeveloped, but basic logic is:
- mature at roughly the same rate as humans, considered adults late teens/early 20s
- first part of life is spent amphibious, kind of tadpole-esque, although the exact consequences of this are not clear; needs to remain consistent with Kenzo solo where Eric's character had two baby lizardfolk he was protecting
- age only a little slower than humans, generally considered an elder in their 70s, congruent with declines in fertility 
- extended period of "elderness" / post fertility; most lizardfolk live for a 100 years as an elder, and some reach 200; this is not fixed but should be decided. some lizardfolk ages might need to be adjusted but as far as i know there is no canonical constraints to tweaking a few birth dates if needed
- elders/community control fertility in some magical way, limiting birth rates of villages/communities to what is sustainable by the ecosystem; not clear how this interacts with parentage and families

**Game Mechanics**: Samso has used versions for a long time; lasted post-2024 revisions version has only be lightly playtested but feels like it is in a reasonable place - see design logic below for details. 

**Notes**
- [ ] [[Lizardfolk]]: overview page, needs updates to capture vibes better and add dm notes / meta about biology, elders, land, community
- [ ] [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]]: stub, needs some basic ideas; see also [[Udazkena]], [[Bero]], [[Hazkunde]], and [[Negu]], which are all blank stubs
- [ ] [[Latazaro]], [[Ozabal]], [[~Yeraad Lizardfolk Swamp~]] could all use a little bit of invention as major lizardfolk communities; others also must exist, some of which don't even have stubs (salt lizardfolk in Mawar; lizardfolk settlements in Apporia from Samso's backstory; lizardfolk community outside Darba)
- [x] D&D Beyond Homebrew Mechanics
- [ ] D&D Beyond Text -> Link to Taelgarverse needs to be updated to point to this page when it is pushed.

### Design Logic

this is "balanced" off the Aasimar, which has (a) resistance to a common and a rare damage type, (b) one cantrip, (c) darkvision, (d) a limited use healing ability, and (e) a 3rd level ability to activate a transformation

(a) possible new firstborn gift choice? natural armor?
(b) prophetic vision is maybe balanced with a cantrip; compared to guidance, it is limited use but affects attack rolls and saves
(c) aquatic adaptations is hard to compare to darkvision but maybe roughly on par
(d) Omens of the Ancestors is effectively a limited use ability, but weaker than healing
(e) ancestral aid is designed to be on part with limited transformation but might not succeed

Natural Armor is hard to value. It is equivalent to a 1st level spell (Mage Armor) for classes with no or just light armor, but totally useless for classes with medium or heavy armor. My impression is this kind of trait is considered bad design these days so waffling on what to do. It seems weird to make natural armor a choice for a Firstborn feature but that would be the obvious solution. 

There is no "firstborn's gift" option here - the simplest thing to do would be to make four options that include Natural Armor and three others which would mitigate the "natural armor is useless to some classes" and make it worth a 1st level spell, but feels a little weird from an in-world perspective. 

Of course not everything has to be balanced and especially between-species balance is not too crucial in my mind as long as all species feel satisfying to play. but the "this feature is useless for a heavy armor cleric or fighter" is still not ideal IMO.
