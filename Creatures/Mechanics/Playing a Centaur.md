## Creating Your Centaur Character



### Centaur Names

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: You are Medium
**Speed**: 40 feet
**Age**: Centaurs mature and age at the same rate as humans. 
**Languages**: The wide wanderings of many centaurs has left them prone to learn languages quickly. You may select six [[Languages]] during character creation, which should usually include Common, Centaur, and often either Elven or Sylvan. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Centaur Traits

%%^Campaign:none%%
centaur design logic, taking the basic model of the PHB 2024 to be a species should consist of traits approximately the same value as (a) an origin feat, (b) a skill proficiency, and (c) a flavorful and situationally strong ability, but that species can vary a bit up or down from this for flavor

Equine Build is nearly useless and may actually be detrimental
Sure Footed + Migratory Instincts is probably roughly choose 1 skill
Touched By Fate is strictly better than human inspiration trait
40 foot speed is strong, this is effectively permanent longstrider, and at least equal to 1/2 an origin feat

so probably still need ~ 1/2 an origin feat in value, but on the weak side. twist of fate might be a little strong for this but whatever. 

%%^End%%

#### Equine Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

#### Sure Footed
You have Advantage on d20 Tests you make to avoid or end the Grappled or Restrained conditions, and on Strength savings throws you make to avoid forced movement or being knocked prone. 

#### Migratory Instincts
You come from a long line of migratory ancestors. As long as you are on the Material Plane, you always know which way is north, and you have Proficiency in the Survival skill. 

#### Twist of Fate
You are deeply attuned to the tides of fate and can manipulate it in small ways. When a creature you can see succeeds or fails on a d20 Test, you can use your Reaction to roll a d4, and either add or subtract the number rolled from the check, potentially turning failure into success or success into failure. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all expended uses when you complete a Long Rest.
