## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: You are Medium
**Speed**: 40 feet
**Age**: Centaurs mature and age at the same rate as humans. 
**Languages**: The wide wanderings of many centaurs has left them prone to learn languages quickly. You may select six [[Languages]] during character creation, which should usually include Common, Centaur, and often either Elven or Sylvan. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Centaur Traits

%%^Campaign:none%%
centaur design logic, taking the basic model of the PHB 2024 to be a species should consist of traits approximately the same value as (a) an origin feat, (b) a skill proficiency, and (c) a flavorful and situationally strong ability, but that species can vary a bit up or down from this for flavor

Equine Build is nearly useless and may actually be detrimental
Sure Footed is significantly weaker than 1/rest Heroic Inspiration
40 foot speed is strong though, this is effectively permanent longstrider

probably something like 2 cantrips + skill prof worth of value would be sufficient
thematically want something fate-ish, something tied to migrations

%%^End%%

#### Equine Build
You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

#### Sure Footed
You have Advantage on d20 Tests you make to avoid or end the Grappled or Restrained conditions, and on Strength savings throws you make to avoid forced movement or being knocked prone. 


%% notes only %%

MMoTM is:
#### Speed

Your walking speed is 40 feet.


#### Hooves

You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

#### Charge

If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a bonus action, making one attack against the target with your hooves.

#### Natural Affinity

Your fey connection to nature gives you an intuitive connection to the natural world and the animals within it. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling), [Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), or [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival).

Definitely Equine Build and Speed make sense to keep. 
Instead of Charge, maybe steal the bonus action Dash from PHB 2024 Orcs? 
Natural weapons are boring IMO
Natural Affinity is mixed, a skill proficiency maybe but flavor is not quite Taelgar-centaur for me

Centaur vibe has a bit of prophecy / reading the natural world; also the wandering migration, and the "we were the first children of Taelgar" / connection to the material plane. Need to think a bit about what traits might reflect that.
