## Basic Traits

**Creature Type:**  Fey
**Size:** Small
**Speed:** 30 Feet
**Age**: The fey have an unusual relationship to time. Many fey do not appear to age; those that do age may age at unpredictable rates, or may appear to grow old as if they are human. However, most typical fey cannot persist on the Material Plane for more than roughly a human lifespan. 
**Languages:** Your connection to the Feywild grants you knowledge of Sylvan. You may also select four additional [[Languages]] during character creation, which likely includes at least Common. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 
## Fairy Traits

As an fairy, you have these special traits.

%%^Campaign:none%%

generally all fey get darkvision and fey ancestry, imo
otherwise will typically just copy traits from official species

%%^End%%

#### Darkvision
You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have Advantage on savings throws to avoid or end the Charmed condition. 

#### Fey Nature
You do not need to sleep, and magic cannot put your to sleep. To gain the benefits of a Long Rest, you must spend 6 hours in a dream-like state. In this state, you appear motionless, but you are not rendered Unconscious, and you can perceive as normal.

#### Fairy Magic

You know the druidcraft cantrip.

Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the enlarge/reduce spell with this trait. Once you cast faerie fire or enlarge/reduce with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

#### Flight

Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You cannot use this trait if your Speed is reduced by an effect related to the weight you are carrying, such as wearing armor for which you don't meet the strength requirement, or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity.
