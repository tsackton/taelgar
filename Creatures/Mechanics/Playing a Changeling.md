## Basic Traits

**Creature Type:**  Fey
**Size:** Medium
**Speed:** 30 Feet
**Age**: The fey have an unusual relationship to time. Many fey do not appear to age; those that do age may age at unpredictable rates, or may appear to grow old as if they are human. However, most typical fey cannot persist on the Material Plane for more than roughly a human lifespan. 
**Languages:** Your connection to the Feywild grants you knowledge of Sylvan. You may also select four additional [[Languages]] during character creation, which likely includes at least Common. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Changeling Traits

As a changeling, you have the following special traits. 

#### Darkvision
You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have Advantage on savings throws to avoid or end the Charmed condition. 

#### Fey Nature
You do not need to sleep, and magic cannot put your to sleep. To gain the benefits of a Long Rest, you must spend 6 hours in a dream-like state. In this state, you appear motionless, but you are not rendered Unconscious, and you can perceive as normal.


#### Changeling Instincts

Thanks to your connection to the fey realm, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills).

#### Shapechanger

As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight and can change your size between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of an individual you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait.
