# Plane-touched Species Details
*See more: [[Humans]]
D&D Beyond Link: see Plane-Touched Traits, below

Very rarely, a human is born with a soul that is connected to another plane. Perhaps some of your essence leaked from that plane, or perhaps an extraplanar power had some influence on your parents or your birth. Or perhaps you have a stranger story. 

Whatever the cause, your soul is touched by another plane. Most commonly, this is one of the elemental planes: perhaps you were born during an epic storm in which the elemental plane of air leaked into the Material Plane. Less commonly, this is one of the Spiritual Realms: perhaps you were blessed by a divine being, or cursed by a fiend. 

Some of the plane-touched can hide their true nature, and live normal lives among the society and culture in which they are born. Others are born, or manifest as they grow, physical attributes linking them to the plane that lingers on their soul. Though usually subtle, these features can make the plane-touched nature of the person who bears them obvious.

## Creating Your Plane-touched Character

To create your plane-touched character, consider the nature of the plane that touches your soul. Is it an elemental plane, a divine realm, or something darker, a realm of fiends or other evils? Does your physical appearance reflect your plane-touched nature, or can you hide your features? 

Consider also the cause of your plane-touched nature. Do you know what happened to you, or do you still wonder? How does your character view their plane-touched nature? Is it a curse, a blessing, or something more complicated?

Finally, consider where you came from, perhaps referencing the [[Playing a Human]] document for ideas. After all, you must have been born into a human family, somewhere in the world. Does your family known your plane-touched nature? Do they accept you, or are you an outcast?

### Plane-touched Names

Many plane-touched humans will have names derived from the culture they were born into; see [[Playing a Human]] for more ideas here. 

Consider whether you might have taken on a different name when you realized your plane-touched nature.

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: You age at the same rate as humans. 
**Languages**: Your connection to another plane grants you knowledge of the language associated with the plane that touches your soul. You may also select four additional [[Languages]] during character creation. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Plane-touched Traits

The species traits you will use will be determined by the nature of the plane that touches your soul: 
- If you are touched by one of the [[Divine Realms]], use the [Aasimar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1751434-aasimar) species traits. 
- If you are touched by a fiendish plane, most likely the [[Abyss]] or the [[Nine Hells]], use the [Tiefling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1751443-tiefling) species traits. You may select any tiefling lineage; your choice of lineage is mechanical only and does not need to determine the exact plane that touches your soul. 

You also have the option of using the [[Playing a Human|Human]] species traits, and reflecting your plane touched nature in your class, e.g. as a sorcerer or warlock with an origin appropriate to your plane-touched nature.

Elemental Planes are basically genasi, but the D&D genasi need a little tweaking. 

Generally should be:
(1) 1-2 appropriately themed boons at 1st. this could include darkvision, breath holding, amphibious, or similar traits
(2) a protective trait, likely an appropriate damage resistance but could be something like Earth Genasi Earth Glide
(3) A cantrip at 1st, 1st level at 3rd, 2nd level at 5th spell trait

Other planes might be complicated and would need to be homebrewed for a specific player invested in them.
