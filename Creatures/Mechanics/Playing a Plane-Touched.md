# Playing a Plane-Touched
*See more: [[Humans]]
D&D Beyond Link: see Plane-Touched Traits, below

%% check mike for lore - i think the lore here is that these are humans with soulstuff from another plane. invented because one of isaac's friends wanted to play a tiefling but i actually think it fits really well with the soulstuff metaphysics%%

Very rarely, a human is born with a soul that is connected to another plane. Perhaps some of your essence leaked from that plane, or perhaps an extraplanar power had some influence on your parents or your birth. Or perhaps you have a stranger story. 

Whatever the cause, your soul is touched by another plane. Most commonly, this is one of the elemental planes: perhaps you were born during an epic storm in which the elemental plane of air leaked into the Material Plane. Less commonly, this is one of the Spiritual Realms: perhaps you were blessed by a divine being, or cursed by a fiend. 

Some of the plane-touched can hide their true nature, and live normal lives among the society and culture in which they are born. Others are born, or manifest as they grow, physical attributes linking them to the plane that lingers on their soul. Though usually subtle, these features can make the plane-touched nature of the person who bears them obvious.

## Creating Your Plane-touched Character

To create your plane-touched character, consider the nature of the plane that touches your soul. Is it an elemental plane, a divine realm, or something darker, a realm of fiends or other evils? Does your physical appearance reflect your plane-touched nature, or can you hide your features? 

Consider also the cause of your plane-touched nature. Do you know what happened to you, or do you still wonder? How does your character view their plane-touched nature? Is it a curse, a blessing, or something more complicated?

Finally, consider where you came from, perhaps referencing the [[Playing a Human]] document for ideas. After all, you must have been born into a human family, somewhere in the world. Does your family known your plane-touched nature? Do they accept you, or are you an outcast?

### Plane-touched Names

Many plane-touched humans will have names derived from the culture they were born into; see [[Playing a Human]] for more ideas here. 

Consider whether you might have taken on a different name when you realized your plane-touched nature.

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: You age at the same rate as humans. 
**Languages**: Your connection to another plane grants you knowledge of the language associated with the plane that touches your soul. You may also select four additional [[Languages]] during character creation, which likely include Common and the native language of your homeland. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Plane-touched Traits

The species traits you use are determined by the nature of the plane that touches your soul: 
- If you are touched by one of the [[Divine Realms]], use the [Aasimar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1751434-aasimar) species traits. 
- If you are touched by one of the Spiritual Realms, but not divine, use the Plane-Touched traits below. This could be a fiendish plane like the [[Abyss]] or the [[Nine Hells]], or it could be something like [[Arborea]] or [[Limbo]]. 
- If you are touched by an elemental plane, such as the [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] or the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], use the Elemental-Touched traits below. 
- You also have the option of using the [[Playing a Human|Human]] species traits, and reflecting your plane touched nature in your class, e.g. as a sorcerer or warlock with an origin appropriate to your plane-touched nature.

This is basically built on the Tiefling framework, with some small tweaks. But you essentially get:

(1) Darkvision or another similar trait, such as breath holding, water breathing, ignore difficult terrain, etc
(2) A minor magical boon such as Thaumaturgy
(3) A protective trait, usually resistance
(4) A planar legacy trait, that gives you a cantrip at 1st, a 1st level spell at 3rd, and a 2nd level spell at 5th

### Plane-Touched

#### Darkvision
You have [Darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet.

#### Otherworldly Presence
You know the [Thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619174-thaumaturgy) cantrip. When you cast it with this trait, the spell uses the same spellcasting ability you use for your Planar Legacy Trait.

#### Planar Legacy
You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a legacy from the Planar Legacies table. You gain the level 1 benefit of the chosen legacy.

When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the legacy).

| Legacy   | Level 1                                                                                                                                | Level 3                                                                     | Level 5                                                                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abyssal  | You have Resistance to Poison damage. You also know the [Poison Spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618875-poison-spray) cantrip. | [Ray of Sickness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618935-ray-of-sickness) | [Hold Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619153-hold-person)                 |
| Chthonic | You have Resistance to Necrotic damage. You also know the [Chill Touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618965-chill-touch) cantrip. | [False Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618866-false-life)           | [Ray of Enfeeblement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618926-ray-of-enfeeblement) |
| Infernal | You have Resistance to Fire damage. You also know the [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618890-fire-bolt) cantrip.         | [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619149-hellish-rebuke)   | [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619080-darkness)                       |
%% this is just tielfling, but would be easy to add other legacies for other planes with the same formula. Cthonic actually feels like the "anti-Arborea". Limbo would be easy to add; Arborea and Mechanus a little trickier to figure the resistance. %%
