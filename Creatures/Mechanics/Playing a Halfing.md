# Playing a Halfing
*See more: [[Halflings]], [[First Ones]]*
D&D Beyond Link: [Halfling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1755936-halfling)

%% check/mike -> see status section below %%

The whistle of the wind in the sails, on a ship crashing through the waves far from land. The clink of coin changing hands at the market. The crackle of the campfire and the smell of bacon and tomatoes sizzling after a long day of walking. The creak of a wagon lumbering to the next village, with a cheery tune emanating from within. [[Halflings]] love these things. A nomadic people who rarely settle in one place for long, halflings come and go with the rhythm of the seasons, making money, friends, or both along the way.

Halflings are wanderers and travelers, merchants and sailors, storytellers and poets, often seen in the communities of other species. Though many halflings are nomadic, and rarely settle in one place for long, they are deeply connected to each other by a unique ancestral consciousness mediated by their gods, the [[First Ones]], which allows them to communicate telepathically and remember fragments of their ancestors' knowledge and lives. Halflings, while not as numerous as humans, are frequent sights across the realms of many species of Taelgar. Cheerful and friendly with outsiders, but private and protective of their kin and traditions, halfling traders, wanderers, and storytellers keep the world connected.

## Creating Your Halfling Character

When you create your halfling character, you might want to consider how your past influenced your character. Many halflings are wanderers, with no fixed home, traveling in caravans, or ships, often in family groups. Sometimes these might follow regular or semi-regular paths, although others wander where whims take them. Other halflings settle, usually among other species, and often in crossroads or places where many travelers and stories cross their paths. Halfling villages or towns are exceedingly rare; there are no settled halfling realms known in Taelgar. 

Halflings also usually have close ties to their kin and family, especially as many halflings effectively work in the family business running a trading ship or a merchant caravan. You might want to think about your family and what they do. Did you come from a traveling family, merchants or sailors? How did your travels impact your choices to become an adventurer? Or, are your origins from a settled community? 

A simple answer if engaging with the lore of halflings is not of interest to you is that your family runs a merchant caravan, or perhaps sailing ship, traveling a routine route in safe places, perhaps from somewhere close, but not too close, to where your adventures begin.

### Halfling Names

Halflings have given names and family names, which are often derived from nicknames, professions, or family lore.

## Basic Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Small (about 2–4 feet tall) 
**Speed:** 30 feet  
**Age**: Halflings mature at roughly same rate as humans, and typically a little longer than humans, often reaching 100 with a rare few living substantially longer.   
**Languages:** The frequent travels and ancestral memory of halflings exposes them to many languages. You may select five [[languages]] during character creation, which should likely including Halfling and Common. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Halfling Traits

As a Halfling, you have these special traits.

#### Silent Speech
You have Telepathy with a range of 120 feet. You must share a language to communicate with a creature in this way. You can include more than one target in your telepathic communication as long as all targets share this trait. %%halflings can have group conversations with telepathy, but halfling <-> non-halfling is limited to pairs %%
#### Memory of the Ancestors
Your telepathic connection to the halfling's ancestral memory can aid you when you seek to recall knowledge. When you take the [Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction) action, you can expend one use of this feature to add a d6 to the roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. Alternatively, you can expend 3 uses of this feature to treat the roll on the d20 as a 20. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 
#### Luck
When you roll a 1 on the d20 of a D20 Test, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.
#### Halfling Talent
Halflings are generally small, quick, charming and adaptable wanderers. You may choose one of the following talents to represent your connection to the First Ones: Nwana, the Stranger/Child; Obito, the Music Maker/Merchant; or Jemghari, the Storyteller/Wanderer.

- _Nwana's Grace_. You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours, and you can use your Dexterity modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for any Strength check to climb, swim, or jump. This does not change your default jump distance.
- _Nwana's Stealth_. You can take the [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
- _Obito's Charm_. You can use a Bonus Action to project a minor telepathic aura that extends to the range of your Silent Speech. Choose one creature you can see that is within the aura. The next time you take the [Influence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InfluenceAction) action against the target, while the target is in your telepathic aura, you have Advantage on the d20 Test. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
- _Obito's Knowledge_. You have a knack for picking up new things. You gain your choice of one tool proficiency. In addition, the amount of downtime required for you to learn a new tool proficiency is reduced by half. 
- _Jemghari's Bravery_. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
- _Jemghari's Speech._ You learn two languages. In addition, you only require one-third as much downtime as normal to learn a new language.

## Status


**Lore**: vibes feel fairly complete; general settlement pattern and place in the world is complete; feels easy to use and understand in game; sources like [[Story About Halfling Merchants]] capture the vibe well. 

**Religion**: [[First Ones]] have some notes; more [[Halfling Religious Practice]] and in [[Halfling Racial Theology]], and in [[Email - Halfling Thoughts]], [[Email - Halfling Religion]]

**Unique Biology**: lifespan and fertility roughly match humans, so there is little need for any unique halfling biology. they are the most "human-ish" of the so-called "elder folk"

**Game Mechanics**: well developed, used for Wellby plus minor characters (NPCs like Tilly and PCs like Yvan and Finnan); probably does not need any revisions

**Notes:**
- [ ] [[Halflings]]: overview page, likely needs an update to better capture vibes, and perhaps link to sources better, could also better incorporate some ideas only developed in [[Land Holding in Sembara]] and [[Taxes in Sembara]]
- [ ] [[First Ones]]: has some initial short notes; could use a little more elaboration as well as individual notes for each deity
- [x] D&D Beyond Mechanics
- [ ] D&D Beyond Text -> Link to Taelgarverse needs to be updated to point to this page when it is pushed.

## Design Notes

hafling design logic, taking the basic model of the PHB 2024 to be a species should consist of traits approximately the same value as (a) an origin feat, (b) a skill proficiency, and (c) a flavorful and situationally strong ability, but that species can vary a bit up or down from this for flavor

Silent Speech is strong, but not that much stronger than the Message cantrip, probably equal to 1/2 an origin feat
Luck is situationally strong but not that much better than 1/day Heroic Inspiration
Memory of the Ancestors not that different from a skill proficiency, although hard to exactly value
Halfling Talent is not quite 1/2 an origin feat, but as other features are on the strong side this seems fine.
