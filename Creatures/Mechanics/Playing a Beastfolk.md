## Creating Your Beastfolk Character

(1-2 PARAGRAPH; ROLE PLAYING AND BACKSTORY CONSIDERATIONS)
(Ideally include an "if you don't want to engage with lore" option)

### Beastfolk Names

(Generic naming rules if player wants to use "typical" choices)

---
## Basic Traits

**Creature Type:**  Fey
**Size:** Medium or Small
**Speed:** 30 Feet
**Age**: The fey have an unusual relationship to time. Many fey do not appear to age; those that do age may age at unpredictable rates, or may appear to grow old as if they are human. However, most typical fey cannot persist on the Material Plane for more than roughly a human lifespan. 
**Languages:** Your connection to the Feywild grants you knowledge of Sylvan. You may also select four additional [[Languages]] during character creation, which likely includes at least Common. Like all characters, you may choose to replace one of these language proficiencies with a tool proficiency. 

## Beastfolk Traits

#### Darkvision
You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have Advantage on savings throws to avoid or end the Charmed condition. 

#### Fey Nature
You do not need to sleep, and magic cannot put your to sleep. To gain the benefits of a Long Rest, you must spend 6 hours in a dream-like state. In this state, you appear motionless, but you are not rendered Unconscious, and you can perceive as normal.

#### Animal Essence
You adopt some of the characteristics of the animal you resemble. To represent this, you may choose one of the following sets of species traits, based on your form. 

- *Rabbitfolk*: [Haregon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/814914-harengon)
- *Catfolk*: [Tabaxi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1026403-tabaxi) or perhaps [Leonin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/410992-leonin)
- *Birdfolk:* You gain a Flying Speed equal to your walking speed (which you cannot use if your Speed is reduced due to the weight you are carrying, such as if you are wearing armor for which you don't meet the Strength requirements), and Proficiency in one skill of your choice from Stealth (appropriate for owls or other quiet/sneaky birds), Performance (appropriate for parrots or other showy birds), Perception (appropriate for eagles and other far-sighted birds), or another skill that fits your animal form. 
- *Bearfolk and other large/strong predators*: [Bugbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species/1026380-bugbear)

If none of these sets of traits fit for your choice of beast form, work with your DM to develop a set of traits to represent your character.
