# Playing a Stoneborn
*See more: [[Stoneborn]], [[Sentinel Range|Indalas]]*
D&D Beyond Link: 

%% lore, mechanics if you have comments %%

[[Stoneborn]] are a reclusive species, tending to live in isolated, close-knit communities in extreme environments, especially high in the mountains. Often settling in inhospitable environments, rumors say that stoneborn rely on the hidden magic of [[Entamba]], their creator god, to thrive in places others would starve. Though few outsiders have seen their communal villages, Stoneborn are sometimes encountered in the settlements of humans, dwarves, and other species of Taelgar. These travelers are often master artisans, deeply skilled in their trades, and it is often said that individual stoneborn spend decades, or even a century, honing their craft. 

Stoneborn appear to be humanoids shaped of stone, and have appearances as diverse as the varied colors and textures of stone in the world. This appearance has led outsiders to speculate that they are literally born from the stone of their mountain home; whether this rumor is true, the stoneborn do not say.

## Creating Your Stoneborn Character

When you create your stoneborn character, consider why you left your community. Many stoneborn villages share an ethos communal decision-making and consensus-building that creates extremely close-knit communities. Did you leave your home on a personal mission? A mission for your community? Or maybe a tragedy forced you to leave, or a personal mistake drove you into exile. 

Many stoneborn also have a deep sense of mastery over a craft, often training for very long periods to become true masters. Do you have a craft or obsession you are connected to? Did you have a mentor or a master you apprenticed under? Or maybe you are still seeking your craft; perhaps your class represents your focus. 

A common story, if you engaging with the lore of the stoneborn does not interest you, is that you grew up in an isolated village in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], and left your home on a personal mission unrelated to your village or community. 

### Stoneborn Names

Stoneborn in Taelgar typically have a single given name; in stoneborn society names are not gendered. Some stoneborn may also use the name of their community as a signifier, especially when traveling outside their homeland. 

For some stoneborn, their training and discipline are as much a part of their identity as their family and community; these stoneborn may take a use name reflecting their skill. For example, a skilled stonemason may take the use name Stonebreaker or Stonecarver; a skilled warrior may take the use name Quickblade or Strongaxe; or a skilled teacher may take the use name Loremaster or Mindshaper. These use names are often used in place of a community name, and sometimes used in place of a birth name. 

To choose the name for your stoneborn character, you might consider one of the birth names below, or invent your own, which might not follow typical stoneborn conventions. You might also choose to invent a use name and/or a community name for your character.

## Stoneborn Traits

As a Stoneborn, you have these special traits.

%% stoneborn design logic is a little different as it feels like there is room for a species with one major impactful ability and not necessarily a lot of minor abilities. this is similar to the phb 2024 goliath design, or the 2024 phb gnome design.  the goal is to make Entamba's Blessing a choice of powerful thematic "anime monk" kind of abilities but probably still needs balancing work.

still need one more feature probably besides blessing and powerful build...

%%

#### Powerful Build
You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

#### Entamba's Blessing
As a Stoneborn, you can use your connection to Entamba to perform feats of strength, endurance, and mental stamina. You may select one of the following disciplines:

- Entamba's Body: You have resistance to Poison and Cold damage, and you have Advantage on saving throws against poison. 
- Entamba's Will: You have Advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. 
- Entamba's Strength: When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. You can use this effect a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 
- Entamba's Protection: When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

%% maybe could use one more option? %%


%% old option from previous iteration:
- _Entamba's Dance (Sandborn only):_ You learn to mimic the shifting sands and blowing winds of your desert home. Your base movement speed increases to 35 feet. In addition, when a creature targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature's attacks against you to be rolled with disadvantage until the start of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after you finish a short or a long rest.
