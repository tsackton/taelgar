# Dwarven Religious Practice

%% tagged mike in case you have comment or additional thoughts %%

Dwarven religion centers around the obligations and responsibilities of dwarves to [[Bahrazel]], and the rights and privileges granted by the [[Bahrazel]] in return. To many outsiders, dwarven religion often appears strange, or even to be not really a religion at all. Unlike most religious humans, dwarves are usually not particularly prayer or ritual oriented, and few dwarves have any kind of personal relationship with any of the [[Bahrazel]]. Nonetheless, the relationship between dwarves and the [[Bahrazel]] is the foundation of dwarven society and power. As the dwarves might say, the [[Bahrazel]] are like the mountains: you depend on them, they are the foundation of your society and wealth, but you generally can't, and don't, expect any kind of personal relationship with them. 
## Obligations and Favors

The main idea and guiding principle of dwarven religion is based around set of obligations and debts in exchange for power and favors. 

The most fundamental of these obligations is the blessing of the naming rite, when a young dwarf becomes  part of the dwarven community and accepts the obligations owed the Bahrazel. In return, the young dwarf gains the connection that sustains dwarven racial magic. Dwarves who never complete the ritual are seen as variously traitors and deserters, or, more benignly, non-citizens or even non-dwarves. And abandoning your clan, thuhr, and obligations to the Bahrazel after the ritual is a much greater crime than simply never making the exchange in the first place. 

The obligations that flow from this exchange are centered around accepting one’s role in dwarven society, and one's obligations to one's fellow dwarves, that all dwarves must have enough before any dwarf has an excess. The supposed reputation for greed of dwarves is largely imposed outsiders who don't understand the culture. 

Beyond the basic obligations to dwarven society that flow from the divine grant of runic magic at the blessing of the naming rite, the other common obligation that dwarves bear arises from the granting of a miracle of divine intervention. Such miracles, though rare, are not unheard of. However, those who are granted such miracles incur a debt to the [[Bahrazel]], that must eventually be paid. Because of this, prayers often seen as dangerous, in a way. The Bahrazel might grant your prayer, but if they do they have power over you. And they can yank you out of your life to serve their purposes. So prayer is what you do when you are truly desperate. 

This sense of obligation and debt in exchange for the favor and power of the [[Bahrazel]] often, although not always, leads those who wield divine magic to a relationship with the [[Bahrazel]] that may seem  akin to the relationship between a knight and their lord.
## Rites and Rituals

For most dwarves, the Bahrazel are ever-present, even in the absence of particular prayers, rites, and rituals. The Bahrazel are the source of dwarven runic magic, which most dwarves can perform to some degree, and in this way they are a constant presence in dwarven lives. Many dwarves see the Baharzel as the kind of glue that holds everything together, that in some sense enforce the debts of honor and obligation that hold dwarven society together. But, as the dwarves might say, you don’t really worship glue.

There are, therefore, very few dwarven holidays that are explicitly religious in nature -- dwarven societies are much more prone to celebrate their past than the Bahrazel directly, and commenoration of the heroes of past wars are common. 

That said, ceremonies around birth, death, and especially the transition to adulthood do have explicitly religious elements. The ceremony of name-taking, marking the transition from a child to an adult, is a deeply personal, private religious quest, where a young dwarf finds the [[Heart of the Mountain]], the home of the [[Bahrazel]], and is granted their name, thuhr, and runic magic in exchange for accepting the obligations of dwarven society.

And in death, the hope of any dwarf for their spirit to return with honor to that place and dwell with the firstborn. But I am not sure there is much of a religious rite here — dwarven culture feels to me very strongly in the works over faith camp, and if by the time you die you are doomed to either destruction of your soul entirely or some kind of purgatory, it is too late, no last minute prayer is going to help you. And if the firstborn can lead living dwarves to their domain, of course they can gather spirits. So again I think burial customs would largely be around a celebration and honoring of the person, without a lot of explicitly religious rituals.

Also, the Bahrazel don’t really grant prayers in the usual sense, and that typically divine power is accompanied by divine obligation. Unlike many human religions where the gods / divine gain strength through prayer and thus use miracles to sustain faith, the Bahrazel are just the Bahrazel, they don’t get stronger or weaker based on the strength of dwarven belief. Indeed, the debt or obligation to the Bahrazel is almost a physical thing, a fragment of dwarven essence, that is passed into [[Heart of the Mountain]] to allow the Bahrazel to reach into the world, and that that trade is in fact necessary for them to operate. Hence the need to travel to [[Heart of the Mountain]] to obtain your name and thuhr and runic power - each dwarf must leave a bit of themselves behind in the divine realm, an obligation to the Bahrazel, and it is that left-behind bit that powers their runic magic. Metaphysically, the idea is that the embodied gods have more physicality than the incorporeal gods.

### Religion

A few random thoughts about dwarven religion for the Riswynn one-shot.

 I think that the main “idea” of Dwarven religion should be a set of obligations and debts in exchange for power and favors. Should probably feel kind of feudal in nature, with the Bahrazel ultimately the “monarch” and everyone else tied into a web of obligations, responsibilities, rights, and privileges. 

The most fundamental of these would be the blessing of the naming rite, becoming part of the dwarven community and accepting the obligations of the Bahrazel, and in return gaining the connection that sustains dwarven racial magic. In this sense, dwarves who never complete the ritual would be seen as variously traitors and deserters, or, more benignly, non-citizens or even non-dwarves. And abandoning your clan, thuhr, and obligations to the Bahrazel after the ritual would be a much, much greater crime than simply never making the exchange in the first place. 

The obligations that flow from this exchange would largely be around accepting one’s role in dwarven society, and accepting a kind of communal / socialist ethos, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”, but restricted, of course, to dwarves alone – the supposed reputation for greed of dwarves would, in this idea, derive largely from outsiders. 

 One implication of this is that many dwarves are probably not particularly religious, in that there isn’t a lot of prayer or holy days. Certainly there are holidays venerating the Bahrazel, but in some parts of dwarven society these would probably have a bit of a “secular” gloss, kind of like nationalist/patriotic holidays – a bit of a “founding fathers” vibe. 

Another implication of this is that the Bahrazel don’t really grant prayers in the usual sense, and that typically divine power is accompanied by divine obligation. Unlike many human religions where the gods / divine gain strength through prayer and thus use miracles to sustain faith, the Bahrazel are just the Bahrazel, they don’t get stronger or weaker based on the strength of dwarven belief. 

I think, actually, that what this means is that the debt or obligation to the Bahrazel is almost a physical thing, a fragment of dwarven essence, that is passed into the Heart of the Mountain to allow the Bahrazel to reach into the world, and that that trade is in fact necessary for them to operate. Hence the need to travel to the Heart of the Mountain to obtain your name and thuhr and runic power - each dwarf must leave a bit of themselves behind in the divine realm, an obligation to the Bahrazel, and it is that left-behind bit that powers their runic magic. 

Metaphysically, I think the idea should be that the embodied gods have more physicality than the incorporeal gods. Thark, of the orcs, is sustained and reaches into the world through the birth ritual that ties the orcs to his power, for example. For the elves there is probably some aspect of the long process of becoming adult that ties to the gods, not in the sense of an obligation (like the dwarves) or a curse (like the orcs) but somehow. 

Theologically, there should be a lot of debate in dwarven society about the nature of the Bahrazel, are they independent gods, facets of one god, or something else. Many dwarves simply worship them as a collective, for example, giving little thought to the individualistic nature of the seven. 

  
More notes:

* I have never thought of the dwarves as having a very ritual or prayer oriented religion, or even really a religion in the human sense. Part of this is an artifact of the fact that I have four dwarven players across our campaign and Isaac’s campaign, none of whom role play any kind of religious affiliation despite two of the being clerics. But I also think it fits my view of dwarves. The Baharzel are like the mountains. You depend on them, they are the foundation of your society and wealth, but you don’t and in some sense can’t have any kind of personal relationship with them. 

* That said — the hook for the Riswynn solo was that all the other players were dwarves who had prayed for, and been granted, a miracle, but as a consequence had incurred a debt to the gods they could call in. So I kind of imagine that prayers are almost seen as kind of dangerous. The Baharzel might grant your prayer, but if they do they have power over you. And they can yank you out of your life to serve their purposes. So prayer is what you do when you are truly desperate. 

* Related to this, I think is the idea that even for dwarves with some kind of direct relationship with the Baharzel, leveled clerics, that relationship is more of a knight/lord kind of relationship, almost feudal with a sense of reciprocal obligations.  

* On top of this, the Baharzel are literally the source of runic magic, which most dwarves can use to some degree. So they are ever-present, but impersonal in a way. I see dwarves as viewing the Baharzel as the kind of glue that holds everything together, that in some sense enforce the debts of honor and obligation that hold dwarven society together. But you don’t really worship glue.   

* Dwarven religion, such as it exists, is thus much more of celebration of dwarven history, of dwarven heroes. Unlike say Dunmar, most dwarven holidays are not the feast days for gods but commemoration of heroes from the past, and especially memorials to those fallen. Like, I am sure there are a number of celebrations and days of remembrance and the like around the Great War, and even going back to the first wars of the Downfall. 

* That said, ceremonies around birth, the transition to adulthood, and death are explicitly religious. I haven’t thought much about the birth ceremonies, but the ceremony of name-taking is deeply personal, basically a solo quest to find the Heart of the Mountain, which is the plane of the Baharzel. And in death, the hope of any dwarf for their spirit to return with honor to that place and dwell with the firstborn. But I am not sure there is much of a religious rite here — dwarven culture feels to me very strongly in the works over faith camp, and if by the time you die you are doomed to either destruction of your soul entirely or some kind of purgatory, it is too late, no last minute prayer is going to help you. And if the firstborn can lead living dwarves to their domain, of course they can gather spirits. So again I think burial customs would largely be around a celebration and honoring of the person, without a lot of explicitly religious rituals.
