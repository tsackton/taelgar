# The *kestavo*

The *kestavo* is the ancient religion of northern Sembara and the Highlands, and is still practiced in some places in the highlands. It is a religion focused around small gods, the spirits of villages, streams, and hills, who are celebrated in their communities. These spirits, the kestavo, bring the prayers of their communities to [[Divine Presence|Ako]], the Divine. 

Although most kestavo are worshipped only by the people of their particular town or village, some kestavo have gained great fame and pilgrims come from far and wide to their shrines to ask for blessings to be passed along to [[Divine Presence|Ako]]. These include:

* [[Romil]], the glacier king, with his shrine in the tallest mountains in the north
* [[Kamak]], the lurker, who dwells at the bottom of the great Lake Kamchak (change name)
* [[Besla]], who came to the land in the ancient days from the [[Green Sea]], and each spring asks Ahra to send the waters of her homeland to her for company, and thus brings the monsoon rains.

The kestavo are not the only spirits in the land, however. The cruel west wind, [[Zeyfa]], and [[Vaqar]], the fire-below, have many offspring, the vazska. These spirits must be appeased or driven off, or they bring misfortune. The children of Ziva are the spirits of the cold and dry air, of hardship, shortages, and mischief, and although they are not worshipped, they are placated and bribed to stay away. The children of Vacla are the spirits of war and destruction, of injury, of sudden death, of the burning home. They are feared and driven off, whenever possible.  

## The Kestavan Religions

At the heart of Kestavan practices is the local shrine, the home of a kestavo. Each spirit has a home in a specific place, usually a shrine, and watches over the inhabitants of that place. Within their homes, they have great power, and can bring the blessings of [[Divine Presence|Ako]] to their worshippers. But their domains are small, and limited to what is nearby their homes. The kestavo do not live in great heavenly palaces, watching over all of Taelgar; they live in small shrines, tended by the community, local places of devotion. A few kestavo, of great fame, live in two, three, or even a dozen shrines, but no spirit can divide itself too much without dispersing on the winds, an unquiet ghost. And so to gain the blessing of even the greatest and most famous kestavo, one must travel, to their shrines. 

In the ancient days, many kestavo were known far and wide, and pilgrims would come to their great shrines, which became centers of highland culture. Today, many of these shrines are abandoned, the kestavo gone. Only a few of the most famous kestavo still attract pilgrims, and mostly only in the far north of [[Zimkova]]: [[Romil]], the glacier king, with his shrine on the slopes of the [[Sentinel Range]]; [[Kamak]], the lurker, who dwells at the bottom of [[Lake Kamchak]], and has shrines dotting the shores; and [[Besla]], who came to the land in the ancient days from the [[Green Sea]], and each spring asks [[Divine Presence|Ako]] to send the waters of her homeland to her for company, and thus brings the monsoon rains.  

As the Drankorian traditions of [[Mos Numena]] spread, many adopted the new religion with its powerful divines, but held to some of the ancient traditions. Others held to the old ways, and kept the local shrines.

## Traditionalist Practice  

Most practice is focused around local shrines, invariably thought to house a specific spirit, who is believed to inhabit a specific object, feature of the landscape, or similar. That is, kestavo have specific physical homes in specific objects or places, which must be protected as they provide the gateway through which a kestavo can influence/help the world.  

A new town/community must attract a protector spirit, either because one is already living in the land, or by getting one from an existing shrine to agree to live in two places. Great ceremony around this and very formal establishment of a village / group based around this.  

Some spirits watch over many villages, and are therefore much more powerful… but also, much less focused on any one village.  

Most practice is centered around maintaining the shrine; specific worship doesn’t necessarily occur in the shrine, but it is the house of the god, literally. It is very important that it be well kept, clean, decorated. Sometimes, this means a building -- but if the kestavo lives in a waterfall in the forest, it might mean ensuring no one draws the water or something. The practice also includes specific rituals around giving prayers and wishes to pass on to [[Divine Presence|Ako]], and practices and rituals to scare off or bribe the children of Ziva.

Specific practice is worth developing.   
  
* Purity/ritual cleaning?  
* Dances/music for the kestavo?  
(Both of these are components of Shintoism)  
* Sacrifices or offerings?  
* Specific rituals around decorating or enlivening a shrine?  
* Specific rituals around a new shrine, enlarging, moving, splitting?
%%

Each kestavo also can only carry prayers to [[Divine Presence|Ako]] if they are nearby. This leads to both pilgrimages to specific shrines as well as a great importance on having a shrine in each community, as a center of worship. A new village cannot be established if no kestavo will watch over it.

Note kestavo have no extraplanar presence. This makes everything click - it is why they can’t grant prayers themselves, for example.  I do think this would imply that there are not faded kestavo drifting around the astral plane. Instead there would be places in Taelgar with ghost gods.

Tim's ideas here, which I want to incorporate:  
the actual game mechanics don't really matter -- and if a player ever wanted to be a cleric of the Kestavo you could make up an exception -- but the basic idea that kestavo are strong in their communities and really weak elsewhere, and that clerics follow the same pattern, both explains why the mariner people originally converted to the kestavo, and then why most of sembara dumped them for the eight divines.  
  
also helps explain why Drankor never really conquered the highlands. like, if you imagine something like all clerics can prepare 1/2 level extra spells and cast all spells at one level higher than the slot they expend within a mile of the shrine of their gods, but cannot prepare spells >3rd level and prepare only 1/2 spells per level (instead of 1) if away from home. would make them really hard to conquer, but also make it very difficult for the religion to spread far or go on the offensive.  
  
like, I can imagine a bunch of nature paladins wandering around the highlands dropping 2nd and 3rd level smites on Drankorian armies, well in excess of their actual class power (since I generally imagine that, while there are many people with 1-3 class levels, there is a big drop through level 5, and a much bigger drop after that).

The below is probably not canonical:
Personal shrines are rare -- there is little point in having a shrine if the kestavo doesn’t inhabit it, and the rituals to coax a kestavo to establish a second home are long and complex. So some rare homes have personal shrines, but most do not. Some shrines are not in communities, when the kestavo happens to be attached to a natural place that no people live. Most notably, neither Romil nor Kamak live near human settlements.

The expectation is that worship is focused around whereever the kestavo is,.
%%
Vazska don’t have homes -- they are the children of the west wind, and everywhere. Rituals around them are mostly in the form of bribes or threats to keep them away. Sometimes people ask them to bring curses on their enemies etc. 

%%Priests are the companions of the kestavo in some way, supposed to be close to them and keep them happy. Most priests live at or near the shrine, to be near to their god. Several types of relationship

- Spouse -- some priests are seen as the spouse of the god (maybe even true? Would a human be able to have a child with a kestavo? Could that be the source of some of these spirits? Maybe not a good idea… )
    
- Adopted child - esp with the larger and more important kestavo
    
- Adopted sibling - more common with the smaller and more local kestavo
    
- Rarely, parent - most common when a very senior priest is establishing a new shrine and coaxing a new kestavo to move to an area or to develop from the general spirit of the land
    

  

Other thoughts:

- Perhaps some degree of subtle realization that worship does in fact create gods? Not that anyone would know specifically, but maybe there are some cultural elements around ‘birthing’ a kestavo with the idea that a particularly unique feature can be almost grown into a kestavo with the correct set of rituals
    

- In modern day many kestavo have faded back into the land, likely gone forever (or are they? Maybe there are some truly minor spirits, effectively dead gods, but still with a little power to curse a stream, or bless a stream, or something. Little magical features of the landscape that don’t inspire belief but water that cures disease, or a stand of wood that is said to be cursed and anyone trying to cut it down comes to a bad end, or whatever)
    
- Some still survive in the traditional way, and also a handful of the ‘major’ kestavo are still around, their ancient shrines still maintained in northern Vostok or Zovca, and perhaps some of the major kestavo are rattling around in an abandoned shrine, all but dead, but still with some faded energy from the belief in the place. Almost ghost-gods.
    
- The vazska are much more widespread. Perhaps in much of the north, including many places that are fully converted to Mos Numera, there is still a culture of evil spirits that come with the west wind, and that you leave out a small bribe in winter to keep away from your house

one thing to think about: what is the afterlife / what happens to souls?   
  
basic Taelgar metaphysics is that when you die, your soul goes to "The [[Land of the Dead]]" (in need of a better name), where it lingers and then fades, unless collected by a god (or demon or devil) within about 10 days (based on raise dead time limit).   
  
presumably the kestavo, not being powerful in their own right, don't have a "heaven".   
  
some ideas:   
1) the souls of those who follow the kestavo really do just fade  
2) the kestavo pull the soul back to them on taelgar, and it is either reincarnated or becomes part of the kestavo. would have very different implications for the culture  
3) the kestavo are, in some sense, connected to or part of or children of a primordial god, probably the "Earth mother" or Arborea, and that god collects the souls of those who follow the Kestavo  
4) something else?

I was thinking about this from a belief perspective rather than a metaphysics perspective—  
  
The idea I had was the belief at least is that three things might happen to your soul:  
If you are buried near your kestavo and you have respected the kestavo and tradition, you are it’s companion in some sense and dwell with it  
  
On the other hand, if your body isn’t buried near the shrine, or you’ve angered a vazska, you might get carried off by Ziva to be an unquiet ghost lost in the wind.  
Finally some souls are taken to the fire-below, the source of volcanoes and hot springs  
  
Haven’t really thought the last one fully through obviously sounds quiet a bit like Christian hell. Mostly I was thinking it isn’t a punishment, it is a danger to be avoided. That is even good people can end up there, if they say die in battle and are never brought home (would make recovery of bodies very important)
 
 
 OLD EMAILS, MIGHT BE OBSOLETE

Mike:
Here’s a slightly different idea/timeline, what do you think...  
  
- originally a very “northern folk” religion, powerful local spirits who you have to be near to here, some develop a more widespread following but ultimately still have to be near. So pilgrimage to important shrines is a thing and some kestavo are widely known but the local one is always more useful (and they are all about intercession with Ahra / Malik)  
- Mariners appear with their pantheon which is not widely adopted and is weak on some level, they are a smallish population and a lot of them have branched off into this direct worship of Ahra and Malik  
- but some of the pantheon starts to be identified with some of the more well known kestavo — this is an unstable situation most likely. Over time you’d expect either the pantheon to replace the kestavo or to fade away  
- as this mixing is going on, Mos Numena spreads north and basically takes over  
  
So you end up without the pantheon really developing, until it actually develops in cultural resistance to Mos Numena.  
  
So there are three trends in the north currently—  
  
The traditional old school kestavo, although perhaps with a belief that a lot of the more powerful spirits are gone, their shrines destroyed. Still intercessionary.  
  
A neo-kestavo religion in cultural opposition to Mos Numena with a belief in a set of major spirits and that the kestavo are their children in some sense. Not really intercessionary anymore.  
  
Mos Numena converts with perhaps some minor cultural differences from the south (Ie a belief that you leave out old bread to appease the vazska)
 
 Tim:
 This still doesn't feel quite right to me. These are just some random thoughts:

  

The original motivation, in some way, for the Kestavo is, a) to give a source for the intercessionary ideas in eastern Mos Numena, and b) to have some kind of lurking older religion with faded gods and interesting quirks, primarily in the highlands of Sembara and Vostok (but also perhaps into Tyrwingha). I think this means that intercession really has to be key. If the Kestavo tradition is already drifting away from intercession and starting to create its own pantheon, it is less of an obvious cultural trend line to intercessionary traditions in eastern Mos Numena. 

  

I was also thinking a bit about the primordial gods, and the threadlines of the development of Hkaran religion. I think when the northerners left Hkar, a lot of religion wouldn't really be organized around gods with names, but rather you have things like the Earth as a divine concept, asking the land to intercede with the creators. And then you have prayers and curses, a prayer of healing in some sense goes via some kind of Celestia angel, and a curse of disease goes via some kind of Abyssal demon. So you almost have more of a kind of warlock-y idea that words have power and less so than specific divine beings, you have people who can 'catch the ear of a curse' or 'spread the goodwill of a prayer', basically warlocks and sorcerers. So when the northerners leave, religion is more about impersonal forces of the Creators than even guardian spirits with names.

  

More generally, I think there is an inherent tension that is tough to resolve between the idea that religion can develop and evolve, and there can be this complex overlay of religious history with things blending and changing, and the idea that the gods are deeply active in the world, regularly grant miracles to their followers, and grow stronger with more worshippers. If you follow this to its logical conclusion, different pantheons should constantly be at war with each other, and religious pluralism should be impossible, because there is a zero sum game of competition between gods. Even if you assume belief is not fixed, the idea that there are faded gods implies that it does matter. Now, it is possible that gods don't actually care about survival -- after all, in some sense they are all just aspects of Ahra and Malik. Or maybe the metaphysics are more complicated, like it isn't just tied to belief, and certainly not just to the number of worshippers. Ultimately, in some sense, the metaphysics don't matter and can be inscrutable, as long as it doesn't seem totally arbitrary. 

  

I like the distinction between intercessionary and pantheonic faiths, and I like the idea that there is a real metaphysical distinction between, say gods that contain enough of Ahra and Malik themselves to grant miracles by their person (pantheonic gods), and gods that can speak to Arha and Malik only but do not have a strong enough or the right kind of divine essence to do more than that. But I think for this to work in practice, the intercessionary religions need to have a very strong sense of what Ahra and Malik are. They are intentionally left vague because in many religions they would be seen as the overgods, the force of creation and destruction, distant and in some sense irrelevant now that creation is done. But in intercessionary religions, these are the real gods. They need context, different names, they need to be the focus in a lot of ways, the things that are really seen as the "gods". I like a lot of what you've created for the Kestavo, but it doesn't feel like an intercessionary religion.

  

I can think of a couple ideas that may be interesting to play around with:

  

One idea would be to actually have the traditional Kestavo religion not actually be a religion at all, in the sense of the worship of gods, Maybe instead, they worship fey. Really pretty much everything you wrote would basically work fine if, as the northerners crossed the mountains, they found a land that was rich in fey spirits, and the small gods they worshipped told them that they were not servants of Ahra and Malik, or whatever the northerners saw them as, but instead the wind and mountain and all these, who are actually archfey. Some good, some less so. Over time Ahra and Malik recent, maybe into overgods, maybe like an earth mother kind of thing, 

  

Alternatively, with a bit of tweaking the wind and the earth could be Ahra and Malik. The small gods carry messages to the wind, basically. Would need to play around a bit but I think there is potential here.
