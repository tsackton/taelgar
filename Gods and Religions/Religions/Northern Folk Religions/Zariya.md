# Zariya

%%although no details have been invented, this is assumed to share a lot of metaphysical truth with the tansi and kestavan traditions, and some clear vibes about the role of these animal spirits in Vargald magic and how that is affected by the krev in Ursk exist in DM notes%%

%%needs a name for the Divine Presence, like Ako and Anida %%

The *zariya* are the animal spirits worshipped by the [[Vargaldi]]. The word, Zariya, refers both to deities, the small gods of the northern forests that take messages and prayers to the [[Divine Presence]], and to souls, the animal spirits of the [[Vargaldi]] people, that manifest when they shape-shift or summon animal companions. 

As a religion, the folk worship of the [[Zariya]] bears many similarities to the other descendants of the early northern folk religions, such as [[Tanshi Worship]] and the [[Kestavo]], with the notable distinction that the small gods are strongly tied to animal forms.
