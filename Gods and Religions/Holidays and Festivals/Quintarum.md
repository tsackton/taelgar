# Quintarum

Quintarum is a [[Mos Numena]] feast day of [[The Wanderer]], observed as a counterpart to [[Viatela]]. Where Viatela is a festival of homecoming, Quintarum marks leave-taking and the resumption of journeys.

In practice, it is often treated as the end of the quiet winter period between Viatela and Quintarum, when households settle in and traveling companies winter in place.
