# Quintarum

Quintarum is a Sembaran feast day of [[The Wanderer]], observed as a counterpart to [[Viatela]]. Where Viatela is a festival of homecoming, Quintarum marks leave-taking and the resumption of journeys.

In practice, it is often treated as the end of the quiet winter period between Viatela and Quintarum, when households settle in and traveling companies winter in place.

## DM notes

- Sources: [[The Wanderer]]; [[Viatela]]; [[Caerenad]]; [[Into the Chasm Intros]].
- The date is consistently given as Jan 22 in campaign/DM material; see also the mention that the earl’s household in [[Caerenad]] traditionally winters “between [[Viatela]] and [[Quintarum]].”
- In [[Into the Chasm Intros]], Quintarum is used as a campaign calendar anchor: an expedition departs on Jan 8, “two weeks before Quintarum.”
- Name is not fully settled in older notes (“Quintara” vs “Quintarum”; “Viatela/Vitalae” spelling drift); keep an eye out for additional canon references.
