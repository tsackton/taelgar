# Day of Atonement

The Day of Atonement, also called the Feast of Sonkar's Blessing, is a Dunmari holy day celebrated on the winter solstice. It is a day of prayer, atonement, and judgment before [[Sonkar]].

The Day of Atonement begins the holy month of Pralakar (Dec 21–Jan 22), a time associated with forgiveness and reflection, as well as community and family gatherings.
