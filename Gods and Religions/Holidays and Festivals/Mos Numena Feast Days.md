# Mos Numena Feast Days

Those who follow the way of [[Mos Numena]] celebrate many holidays and feast days. Some, such as [[Pyravela]], are ancient and widely celebrated; many others are local thanksgivings for miracles of the divine.

## Widely observed feast days

- [[Viatela]] (Dec 11): a festival of homecoming, dedicated to [[The Wanderer]].
- [[Pyravela]] (Dec 29–31): an ancient year-end festival associated with [[The Wyrdling]].
- [[Quintarum]] (Jan 22): a Sembaran feast day of [[The Wanderer]], often described as a leave-taking counterpart to Viatela.

## Local miracle days

Many communities keep additional feast days tied to local stories of divine intervention. Examples include:

- [[Festival of the Bridge]] (Nov 3) in [[Cleenseau]].
- [[Miracle of the Guided Wanderers]] (Sep 11) in [[Asineau]].
- [[Festival of the Miracle of the Mist]] (Apr 18) in [[Abenfyrd]].
- [[Miracle of the Hopeful Heat]] (Jan 7) in [[Asineau]].

%% Brainstorming

Probably no more than 5-8 universally recognized Mos Numena feast days. 

Viatela.- Dec 11 - traveler holiday of homecoming
Pyravela - Dec 29-31 - wyrdling celebration, remants of old  intercalary time between solstice and new year
unnamed leave-taking holiday - 50 days after Viatela, Jan 30th

## DM notes

- Sources: [[Viatela]]; [[Pyravela]]; [[Quintarum]]; [[Festival of the Bridge]]; [[Miracle of the Guided Wanderers]]; [[Festival of the Miracle of the Mist]]; [[Miracle of the Hopeful Heat]].
- Notes disagree on the leave-taking holiday’s dating (Jan 22 vs Jan 30). Current holiday page [[Quintarum]] uses Jan 22; reconcile if other canon sources exist.
