# Zeyfa
*(ZAY-fah)*


A malevolent spirit in the tradition of the *[[Kestavo]]*, known as the west wind. Their children are the spirits of cold and dry air, of hardship, or shortages, and mischief, and although they are not worshipped, they are placated and bribed to stay away. Zeyfa is thought to live in the depths of the [[Great Chasm]].

%%^Campaign:None%%
In reality, neither Zeyfa nor [[Vaqar]] are individual spirits at all, but rather they are the personification given to various creatures that troubled the [[Zimka]] as they moved across the northern plains. The children of Zeyfa are usually fey.

i think that it is not belief that creates gods, but worship. while the old zimka might have believed in the zeyfa and the vaqar as entities, they didn't worship them; at best they placated them and at worse they cursed them. this kind of investiture of existence might have the power to create something - but definitely not a deity. 

in the case of Zeyfa, this is complicated by the fact that the entities here actually exist, and are fey. and fey are not made of soulstuff. so in this case, mistaken believe is unlikely to matter at all. sometimes you are just wrong and even if you pretend with all your might that an archfey is a god, humanity cannot invest it with divine power. 

my feeling - not canon - is that the existence of a real non-divine entity as the source of power forecloses the possibility of creating a divinity. i think this fits with the history of religion vibe where big gods usually grew out of little gods, not out of nothing. (though there remain some unanswered questions here)
