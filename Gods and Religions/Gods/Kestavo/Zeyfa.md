# Zeyfa
*(ZAY-fah)*

%% Tim: check name and metaphysics. Would belief in a common deity create one? %%
A malevolent spirit in the tradition of the *[[Kestavo]]*, known as the west wind. Their children are the spirits of cold and dry air, of hardship, or shortages, and mischief, and although they are not worshipped, they are placated and bribed to stay away.

%%^Campaign:None%%
In reality, neither Zeyfa nor [[Vaqar]] are individual spirits at all, but rather they are the personification given to various creatures that troubled the [[Zimka]] as they moved across the northern plains. The children of Zeyfa are usually fey.
