# Vaqar
*(VAH-kar)*

%% Tim: check name and metaphysics. Would belief in a common deity create one? %%
A malevolent spirit in the tradition of the *[[Kestavo]]*, known as the fire-below. Their children are the spirits of war and destruction, of injury, of sudden death, of the burning home. They are feared and driven off, whenever possible.

%%^Campaign:None%%
In reality, Vaqar (nor [[Zeyfa]]) are true entities that exists at all. Rather, Vaqar is the name given a fictional source of demons, devils, and other creatures that troubled the [[Zimka]] in the migration east.
