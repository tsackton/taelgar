# Vaqar
*(VAH-kar)*

A malevolent spirit in the tradition of the *[[Kestavo]]*, known as the fire-below. Their children are the spirits of war and destruction, of injury, of sudden death, of the burning home. They are feared and driven off, whenever possible.

%%^Campaign:None%%
In reality, Vaqar (nor [[Zeyfa]]) are true entities that exists at all. Rather, Vaqar is the name given a fictional source of demons, devils, and other creatures that troubled the [[Zimka]] in the migration east.

see [[Zeyfa]] for metaphysics comment 

for Vaqar. specifically, i think that it might be possible that some demon lord styles themselves the fire-below and does get power of a kind from the belief in their existence, but it wouldn't be a deity in any sense. 

and more likely, this is the same as the Zeyfa. just mistaken belief with no metaphysical consequences.
