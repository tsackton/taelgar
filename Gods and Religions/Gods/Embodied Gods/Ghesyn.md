# Ghesyn

Ghesyn, often titled the Goddess of the End and the Hopeless One, is a feared figure associated with the [[Three Despairs]] and the curse of undeath. Player-facing summaries describe her as “the Hopeless One, the Eater of Souls, and the protector of undeath,” while elven lore and theological texts record rumors that she is an Embodied God spawned from [[G'Zab]] and [[Jinnik]] during the [[Riving]].

In this telling, Ghesyn stands alongside [[Thark]] and the [[Endless Chaos]] as a child of the Despairs, her nature twisted not toward creation but toward the unraveling of lives and stories. Some worldbuilding notes and design documents suggest linking Ghesyn especially to the nastier forms of lesser corporeal undead—ghouls, ghasts, wights, and similar horrors—and to the prospect that undeath can devour hope as well as flesh. However, the major metaphysical overviews of undead in Taelgar explicitly flag this connection as tentative rather than settled canon.

Despite this ambiguity, many cultures that know the story of Ghesyn treat her as a symbol of endings without redemption. For most folk she is invoked only in curses and fearful oaths, or as a warning figure in tales about necromancers who push too far and risk losing not just their lives but their souls.

The specific association of Ghesyn with certain lesser corporeal undead is taken from notes that explicitly mark it as non-canonical; this note preserves that uncertainty and highlights it for later review. %%
