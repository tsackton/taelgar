# Bero

Bero is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], the Embodied Gods of the seasons who created the [[Lizardfolk]]. Named alongside [[Hazkunde]], [[Udazkena]], and [[Negu]] in lizardfolk and cosmological texts, Bero is associated with summer and the height of the seasonal cycle. Together, the four Tharzen are honored as Firstborn of the Elder Folk, shaped by the [[Divine Presence]] to guard lizardfolk communities and their wetlands homes.

Lizardfolk teachings describe the Tharzen as the bridge between lizardfolk and the Divine, gathering ancestral spirits after death and returning them as new souls when the waters rise again. In this cycle, Bero’s summer face marks the time of fullness: fish-weirs heavy with catch, reeds at their thickest, and elders at the peak of their strength. Community rites that fall in high summer often call on Bero for courage, vigor, and the wisdom to use abundance without exhausting the land.

Seasonal and ancestral themes extend the shared Tharzen lore in these sources while keeping Bero’s role closely tied to “summer” as already named. %%
