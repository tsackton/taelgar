Jemghari, the Storyteller/Wanderer, reflects the journey and the halfling concept of stories, which are central to their culture. 

They embody the halfling idea that while there are two kinds of tales in the world -- you go on a journey, or a stranger comes to town -- these are really the same tale, seen from different perspectives. Jemghari, therefore, is the one who can experience this story from both perspectives at once.
