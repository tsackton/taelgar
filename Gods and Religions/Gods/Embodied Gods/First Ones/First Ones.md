# The First Ones

The halfling people worship three gods, known collectively as the First Ones or the First Ancestors. The First Ones are often thought of as two-faced gods, each reflecting two aspects of life that are both different and related, one looking inward, the other looking outward. 

[[Nwana]], the Stranger/Child, reflects the home, hearth, and family, reflecting the duality of the inward-looking child and the outward-looking stranger. 

[[Obito]], the Music Maker/Merchant, reflects joy, community, friendship, creativity, creation, commerce, and trade, again reflected against a backdrop of otherness (Merchant) vs insiderness (Music Maker). 

[[Jemghari]], the Storyteller/Wanderer, reflects the journey and the halfling concept of stories, which are central to their culture, reflecting the halfling idea that there are only two kinds of tales in the world: you go on a journey, or a stranger comes to town, which are really the same story. Jemghari, therefore, is the one who can experience this story from both perspectives at once.


%% connection to ancestral mind a little unclear: are they  also the keepers of the collective mind and soul of the species, the ultimate guardians of the joined spirit of all halflings stretching back to the beginning? or does the ancestral mind exist elsewhere somehow? see: [[Halflings#Open Questions and Further Work]] for more. %%
