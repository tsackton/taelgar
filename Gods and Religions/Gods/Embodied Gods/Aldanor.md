# Aldanor
>[!info]+ Summary  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

Aldanor, the Living Tree, is one of the two deities of the [[Elves]], alongside [[Elmerca]], the Wild Star. In elven lore the pair are called the Firstborn, [[Embodied Gods]] through whom the [[Divine Presence]] gave rise to elves. Aldanor embodies life, growth, and endurance, the body and breath of the people, and creates the pull of the *mela* anchors elves to the material world, underlying the elven [[Elven Cycle of Generations|cycle of generations]].

There is very little that has been definitively established, other than a "tree vibe" and the idea that Aldanor is the elven connection to Taelgar in a way, and perhaps the source of the mela and the fertility of elves. (see [[Elven Cycle of Generations]])

The large trees in the elven forest are reminiscent of Aldanor in a way. If gendered, probably he.
