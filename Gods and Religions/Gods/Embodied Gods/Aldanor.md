# Aldanor
>[!info]+ Summary  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

Aldanor, the Living Tree, is one of the two deities of the [[Elves]], alongside [[Elmerca]], the Wild Star. In elven lore the pair are counted among the [[Embodied Gods]], through whom the [[Divine Presence]] gave rise to the Elder race of elves; Aldanor embodies rooted life, growth, and endurance, the body and breath of the people.

Elven traditions describe Aldanor as the source of elven vitality and longevity. When an elf is born they have only a tenuous connection to Aldanor, but in the Age of Beginning they are said to be “entwined in the great Tree of Life,” their bodies strengthened as Aldanor’s lifeforce flows into them. This connection underlies the [[Elven Cycle of Generations|cycle of generations]] and the elven belief that, so long as Aldanor endures, elves can choose when to let go of the mortal world rather than simply aging and dying.

Across elven lands, ancient trees and forests are revered as visible traces of Aldanor’s presence in the world. The dreaming trees of [[Orenlas]] still “echo the song of Aldanor,” and the Elder Tree at the heart of [[Erelion]] is a place of prayer where elves say Aldanor’s spirit can be touched in dreaming. Some histories of the [[Age of Myth]] claim that forests first grew wherever Aldanor walked when the Embodied Gods reshaped Taelgar.

Rituals to Aldanor focus on protection, renewal, and the patient tending of living things. Elven gardeners, healers, and wardens offer thanks to Aldanor before great works of cultivation or restoration, and rivers associated with growth and fertility—such as the Aistanë in the [[Thalurien]] basin—are remembered as bearing Aldanor’s blessing.

There is very little that has been definitively established, other than a "tree vibe" and the idea that Aldanor is the elven connection to Taelgar in a way, and perhaps the source of the mela and the fertility of elves. (see [[Elven Cycle of Generations]])

The large trees in the elven forest are reminiscent of Aldanor in a way. If gendered, probably he.
