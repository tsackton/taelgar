# Elmerca

Elmerca, the Wild Star, is one of the two Firstborn creator deities of the [[Elves]], alongside [[Aldanor]], the Living Tree. Elven tradition names them among the [[Embodied Gods]] fashioned by the [[Divine Presence]]; where Aldanor embodies rooted life and growth, Elmerca is the distant light of insight, passion, and change.

Elven creation stories describe Elmerca as born from a spark of pure energy and foresight, the mind that saw what the world could become. The elves look to Elmerca for dreams, prophecy, and flashes of inspiration. During the Age of Becoming, elven children spend long years in sleep and dream, and their deep sense of mystery and foresight is said to be “imbued by Elmerca.” Many elves speak of Elmerca as the patron of magic, artistry, and the restless curiosity that drives them beyond their forest homes.

Elven river lore links clear, high waters with Elmerca’s domain of thought and sky: the Thalúrien is remembered as sacred to Elmerca, the water of purity and contemplation, while its twin, the Aistanë, bears the blessings of [[Aldanor]]. In [[Erelion]], an observatory set on a quartz escarpment is dedicated to communing with the stars and “the magic of Elmerca,” and elven dream sanctuaries offer spaces where artists and scholars seek Elmerca’s inspiration in shared trances.

Some philosophical texts and private correspondence among elven sages speculate in more detail about the divine realm of Aldanor and Elmerca and the role Elmerca’s foresight played in the great tragedies of elven history, but much of this remains contested and is not treated as settled canon.
