# Elmerca
>[!info]+ Summary  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

Elmerca, the Wild Star, is one of the two deites of the [[Elves]], alongside [[Aldanor]], the Living Tree. In elven lore the pair are called the Firstborn, [[Embodied Gods]] through whom the [[Divine Presence]] gave rise to elves. Elmerca is the distant light of insight, passion, and change, the mind and vision of the people, associated with the *leya*, the time of wandering in the [[Elven Cycle of Generations]]. Elmerca gifts the magic of elves, and in elven stories is associated with moments of great foresight.
