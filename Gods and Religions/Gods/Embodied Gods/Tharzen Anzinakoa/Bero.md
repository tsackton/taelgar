Bero is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] of the [[lizardfolk]], usually seen as the guardian of parents and associated with abundance, flourishing, and the balance of the land and the people.  

Among many lizardfolk communities, particularly those in [[Greater Sembara]], Bero is associated with summer and the wetlands when they are bursting with life.
