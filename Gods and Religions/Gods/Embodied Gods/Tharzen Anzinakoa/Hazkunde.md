# Hazkunde
*(has-KOON-dee)*


Hazkunde is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] of the [[lizardfolk]], usually associated with birth and new growth, and is typically seen as the divinity that guides souls to the [[Material Plane]] to be reborn. 

Among many lizardfolk communities, particularly those in [[Greater Sembara]], Hazkunde is associated with spring, the season of rising waters and the first greening of marsh and river.
