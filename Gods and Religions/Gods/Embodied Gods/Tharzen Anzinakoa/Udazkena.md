# Udazkena
*(oo-DAHS-keh-nah)*

Udazkena is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] of the [[lizardfolk]], often seen as the source of the wisdom of the elders and the deity that lizardfolk most often look to for prophecy and guidance. 

Among many lizardfolk communities, particularly those in [[Greater Sembara]], Udazkena is associated with autumn, with the rituals of shepherding resources for lean times, but also with the blessing for the bounty of the land that provides.
