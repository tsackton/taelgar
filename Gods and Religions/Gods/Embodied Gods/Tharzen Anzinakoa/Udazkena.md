# Udazkena

Udazkena is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], the Embodied Gods of the seasons who created the [[Lizardfolk]]. In lizardfolk and historical texts Udazkena is named as the autumn face of the Tharzen, paired with [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), and [[Negu]] (winter). Together, these four Firstborn embody the seasonal rhythms that shape lizardfolk life.

Lizardfolk lore presents the Tharzen as guardian spirits and intermediaries with the Divine, gathering the souls of the dead and returning them as new life in due time. In that cycle, Udazkena’s season marks the waning of floods, the drawing down of resources, and the careful preparation for the coming of [[Negu]]. Autumn rites commonly emphasize gratitude, fair distribution, and the willingness to let go—virtues some storytellers explicitly link to Udazkena’s guidance.

%% AI note: Expanded from stub using [[Background/Player's Guide]], [[Creatures/Species/Lizardfolk]], [[Gods and Religions/Gods/Embodied Gods/Embodied Gods]], and [[Worldbuilding/Old Documents/Lizardfolk - Old Documents]]. Emphasis on gratitude and preparation in Udazkena’s season reflects extrapolation from the named association with autumn and the Tharzen’s role in the life–death cycle; details can be adjusted as lizardfolk religion is further refined. %%
