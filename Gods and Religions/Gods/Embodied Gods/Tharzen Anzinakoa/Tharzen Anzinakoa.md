# Tharzen Anzinakoa

The Tharzen Anzinakoa, often shortened to “the Tharzen,” are the four Embodied Gods of the seasons who created the [[Lizardfolk]]. Counted among the [[Embodied Gods|Firstborn of the Elder Folk]], they were shaped by the [[Divine Presence]]. Lizardfolk stories describe them as the Eldest of Elders and the bridge between their people and the Divine.

In lizardfolk telling, the Tharzen walked the newborn marshes and braided water with soil, raising reeds and fish where their feet fell. Rains and floodwaters are said to follow their wanderings, and the swamps and riverlands that became lizardfolk homelands are remembered as places where the Tharzen lingered. They gather the spirits of the dead, keeping them safe until new souls are woven and born again, completing the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that shapes lizardfolk views of life and justice.

Most communities venerate the Tharzen both collectively and through their four named faces: [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), [[Udazkena]] (autumn), and [[Negu]] (winter). Seasonal rites pace planting, fishing, nesting, and travel; prayers and songs marking the turning of the year call on the Tharzen and their seasonal aspects, and elders interpret dreams and omens as messages carried by them. To outsiders, lizardfolk devotion can look diffuse, but within lizardfolk cultures the Tharzen are ever-present in ritual, proverb, and daily decision-making.

Lizardfolk epics such as ''[[The Endless Currents]]'' ascribe to the Tharzen a role in the wider multiverse, describing them as weaving threads of spirit and planar energy through the [[Material Plane]] to keep the world from sundering. Scholars debate how literally to take these stories, but they echo broader myths of the Embodied Gods reshaping Taelgar during the [[Riving]].
