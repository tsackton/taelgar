# Negu

Negu is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], the Embodied Gods of the seasons who created the [[Lizardfolk]]. Lizardfolk and cosmological sources name Negu as the winter face of the Tharzen, paired with [[Hazkunde]] (spring), [[Bero]] (summer), and [[Udazkena]] (autumn). Together they are revered as the Firstborn of the lizardfolk and the Eldest of Elders.

Teachings about the Tharzen describe them as guardians of the ancestral dead, gathering spirits after death and returning them as new souls when the time is right. In this cycle, Negu’s season is the long quiet between flood-times, when communities endure scarcity and trust that the Tharzen will send life back with the rising waters. Winter rites in many marshes invoke Negu for endurance, patience, and memory, and for protection of elders and stories through the lean months.

The emphasis on endurance and lean winters extrapolates from Negu’s named association with “winter” and the Tharzen’s ancestral role and is marked here for future review. %%
