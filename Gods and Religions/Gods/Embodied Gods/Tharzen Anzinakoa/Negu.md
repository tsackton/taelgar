# Negu
*(EH-goo)*

Negu is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] of the [[lizardfolk]], usually seen as the guardian of the ancestral spirits. 

Among many lizardfolk communities, particularly those in [[Greater Sembara]], Negu is associated with winter, and the long quiet when the swamps and wetlands lie dormant waiting, poised to erupt with new life.
