# The Endless Chaos

The Endless Chaos is a rumored Embodied God associated with the [[Three Despairs]] and the unmaking of ordered creation. Elven histories and theological treatises record stories that, during the [[Riving]], as [[Divine Presence|Arha]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]] shaped the [[Embodied Gods]] and sundered the planes, the Three Despairs used stolen divine power to create their own children. Out of the union of [[Umidzka]] and [[G'Zab]] came [[Thark]], the God of War Without End; the Endless Chaos is said to be the offspring of Umidzka and [[Jinnik]].

Unlike Thark, whose existence is widely acknowledged because of the orcs, the Endless Chaos remains a matter of rumor and fearful speculation. Some elven sources speak of a being that delights in unbinding forms, dissolving borders between planes, and returning creation to swirling formlessness, but even these accounts admit scholars do not know whether such a god truly exists or whether the idea personifies the destructive impulses of the Void Mind. No organized cults of the Endless Chaos are known in the northwestern lands of Taelgar.

Because the Three Despairs are also blamed in some texts for unleashing curses such as undeath and lycanthropy, later writers sometimes conflate those stories with the figure of the Endless Chaos. Careful theologians tend to treat the Endless Chaos as a cautionary myth about the dangers of unfettered dissolution rather than a clearly attested deity.

The existence and nature of the Endless Chaos are explicitly presented in these sources as rumor rather than established fact, and this note preserves that ambiguity. %%
