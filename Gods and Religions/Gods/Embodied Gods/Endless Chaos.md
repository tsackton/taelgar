# The Endless Chaos

The Endless Chaos is a rumored [[Embodied Gods|Embodied God]] associated with the [[Three Despairs]] and the unmaking of ordered creation, said to spring from the union of [[Umidzka]] and [[Jinnik]]. Though elven loremasters speak of a  being that delights in unbinding forms, dissolving borders between planes, and returning creation to swirling formlessness, no reliable accounts firmly establish whether such a god truly exists or whether the idea simply personifies the destructive upheavals wrought by the [[Downfall Wars]]. 

%% general note
Of the various children of the three despairs, Thark and the Mad One clearly exist and have metaphysics associated with them. Ghesyn seems plausible, provides good fodder for undead cults and the like, and has a plausible planar home in some Hades-in-Greek-myth or other 'plane of despair' type thing. 

However the Endless Chaos is complicated, as they are clearly not associated with Limbo and it isn't obvious there is design space for another 'chaos-like' plane outside of Limbo and (kind of) the Abyss. 

So for now I have leaned into the "might not exist" vibe.
