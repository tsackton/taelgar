# Entamba

Entamba, the Elder Mountain, is the [[Embodied Gods|Embodied Divinity]] who created the [[Stoneborn]], and is venerated by the Stoneborn as the soul of the mountains and the Firstborn of their species. 


Stoneborn lore describes Entamba as both the first Stoneborn and the last: born in the slow uplift of ground into mountains or the fiery blast of a volcano, and present in the dust of peaks worn down over eons and scattered into sea and sky.

Through their connection to Entamba, Stoneborn draw magical strength, resilience, and discipline. Tales speak of Stoneborn masters who, through long meditation and prayer to Entamba, can mold stone, carve villages from sheer cliffs, or warm high mountain meadows enough to sustain crops despite brutal winds and thin air. Game traditions and mechanics alike tie Stoneborn feats of focus and bodily mastery to this bond with Entamba.
