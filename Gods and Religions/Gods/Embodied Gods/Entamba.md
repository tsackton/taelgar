# Entamba

Entamba, the Elder Mountain, is the Embodied God who created the [[Stoneborn]] and is venerated as the soul of the mountains themselves. Stoneborn lore describes Entamba as both the first Stoneborn and the last: born in the slow uplift of ground into mountains or the fiery blast of a volcano, and present in the dust of peaks worn down over eons and scattered into sea and sky.

Through their connection to Entamba, Stoneborn draw magical strength, resilience, and discipline. Tales speak of Stoneborn masters who, through long meditation and prayer to Entamba, can mold stone, carve villages from sheer cliffs, or warm high mountain meadows enough to sustain crops despite brutal winds and thin air. Game traditions and mechanics alike tie Stoneborn feats of focus and bodily mastery to this bond with Entamba.

Stoneborn society mirrors these divine virtues. Communities center on academies and gymnasiums where apprentices train for decades under renowned masters, honoring expertise and patient practice above wealth or rank. When decisions of war and peace must be made, elders gather at sites sacred to Entamba; consensus reached there binds every Stoneborn involved, “acting as one or not at all.”
