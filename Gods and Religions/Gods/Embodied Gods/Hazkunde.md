# Hazkunde
*(haz-KUN-de)*

Hazkunde is one of the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]], the Embodied Gods of the seasons who created the [[Lizardfolk]]. In lizardfolk lore Hazkunde is associated with spring, the season of rising waters and the first greening of marsh and river. As one of the Firstborn of the Elder Folk, Hazkunde is counted among the [[Embodied Gods]] fashioned by the [[Divine Presence]] during the reshaping of Taelgar.

Stories of the Tharzen tell of Hazkunde walking the newborn wetlands, coaxing reeds, fish, and new life from mud and standing water. Lizardfolk teachings describe the Tharzen as gathering ancestral spirits and sending them back as new souls; in the season of Hazkunde, elders speak of the dead returning to the world as hatching young and fresh growth. Many villages mark the start of the seasonal round with rites to Hazkunde, asking for balance between abundance and the carrying capacity of their homelands.
