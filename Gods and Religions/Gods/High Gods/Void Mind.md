# The Void Mind
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[High Gods|high god]]

The Void Mind, alien and not understood, without power, without any ability to reach the material world, is also a high god of a kind, also distant and uncaring of prayer and belief, but dedicated to emptiness, to undoing the creation of the multiverse and all of the work and creation of the [[Divine Presence]]. Whether cults of worship to the Void exist is not recorded in lore.

per invention around soulstuff, the void mind might be related to anti-soulstuff
