# The Sibyl
>[!info]+ Summary  
> she/her

%% vibes and note:
- i've always thought of the sibyl as kind of part of a trio with the wanderer and the wyrdling that are seen as more personal, more present, more likely to pay attention to an individual. 
- the original idea of the sibyl also had a focus on obsession, trying to blend e.g. scholarly obsession and romantic obsession into the divine of love and knowledge, and then sticking on magic on top as it needed a home. 
- perhaps the most greek-goddess-like of any of the eight divines?
- *needs some thought about holy symbol* 

%%

A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Sibyl is usually depicted as a young, beautiful woman, with striking features, carrying a wand, often associated with some elemental power. Sometimes she is depicted with a book instead of a wand. She is the Goddess of magic, song, knowledge, love, and beauty, associated with deep study and also obsession, with the passage of time and the cycles of the moon, and the virtue of love. She watches over marriage, and scholars, and acts of magic.

The Sibyl's wand is typically depicted as a simple wand, with a sleek shaft that twists into a spirally, corkscrew-like design, subtly hinting at the shape of a heart at the point, perhaps. This is sometimes used as a holy symbol, especially by her clerics. 

%% In mechanical terms, her clerics would usually be associated with the Knowledge or Arcana domains. %%
