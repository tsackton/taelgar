# The Wyrdling
>[!info]+ Summary  
> they/them

%% vibes and notes:

discord on wyrdling vs wildling, repeated from wilding page:
- the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort
- maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself
- the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds
- if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling
-  I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large
 - the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal
 - non-canon note in comments at end about place invented but not used in Dunmar Frontier game.
- Mike:  I have some significant in-game experience with wyrdling  as one of my players is a cleric  of the wyrdling, some of which is worth capturing here
- *needs some thought about holy symbol*

A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Wyrdling is rarely depicted in human form, and is depicted in many ways. The most common are chaotic and natural in nature: an embodied storm, a whirlpool, sometimes a rainbow. But some depictions show the Wyrdling as a jester with two faces, one male and one female, happy and sad at the same time. Other times they are depicted as a androgynous face, often depicted as if it was mid-shift from male to female. They are the Divine of chaos, luck, chance, and fate, and are associated with prophecy, divination, dreams, and the virtue of hope. They watch over those taking risks or chances, as well as artists and poets, and those who are lost in their own minds. They are also the Divine of transgender people, and anyone born 'out of season' with themselves. 

%% In mechanical terms, their clerics would usually be associated with the Trickster or Tempest domain.

%% Tim notes - a place in the Chasa river valley you never went to, but dropping here as possible color / ideas for Wyrdling. Not canon, but I kind of like the Solatine Order. 

Solas Abbey, the original but now ruined home of the Solatine Order, an iterant order of worshippers the Wyrdling who historically watched over orphans. While the order is lost and defunct, and the Abbey mostly in ruins, a hermit/priest dedicated to the Wyrdling still lives here, and they still train apprentices.

The building is reminiscent of some Tuscan abbeys, e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo). Sits above the river on a downslope of a hill, near a minor tributary.

While no longer occupied by a religious order, the structure itself is relatively intact, although most of the outbuildings are gone. The original chapel of the Wyrdling remains well-kept, and the current occupant has established quarters in the old chapter room.

A large statue of the Wyrdling in human form, depicted as a two-faced jester, one male, one female, and both with inscrutable expressions dominates the inside of the chapel. The walls are plain stone, but there are three large stained glass windows which depict: a large thunderstorm that looks like it is being held back by a rainbow; a group of children being fed by apples plucked from the sky by a creature that looks like a satyr; a person being hugged by what look like arms of wind, and an evil spirit flying out of them.

There is a strange feeling about the place, not exactly a sense of peace but a sense of belonging. Whatever doubts you might feel about yourself, your place in the world, you feel like someone hears them and cares.

The abbey is currently occupied by a lone hermit/priest, who goes by Mel

This is a safe place to rest - shadow hunters cannot get here.
