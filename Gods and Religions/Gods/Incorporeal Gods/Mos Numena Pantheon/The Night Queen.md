# The Night Queen
>[!info]+ Summary  
> she/her

%% i dumped a bunch of raw notes potentially relevant below, from a Great Library adventure. don't have anything else that isn't in backlinks. searched discord. %%

A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Night Queen is usually depicted as a pale woman, often of indeterminate age, often old. She is usually depicted wearing black robes, and with her face cloaked in shadow, often leaning on a cane. She is the Goddess of darkness, death, and sleep, especially associated with the transition from life to death, and the much rarer transition back to life again. She is the defender against undead and the unnatural extension of life, and associated with the night, and winter, and the virtue of compassion. She watches over funerals, and keeps the night safe.

%% In mechanical terms, her clerics would usually be associated with the Grave or Twilight domains. %%

![[night-queen-v3.jpeg|right|180]]Her holy symbol is a crown of stars, usually depicted as five or six stylized stars in a circle, representing a top-down view of the points of a crown. Sometimes, instead of a stylized crown, she is represented by three stars in an arch with an implied horizon, representing the transition between day and night (and also between life and death).

In art, the Night Queen is often depicted the protector of the dead and of spirits, and the guide who ensures that the dead do not return to haunt the living. Art depicting the Night Queen tends to somber colors, with a starkness that highlights her connection to the night and winter.

%% raw notes

The Night Queen played a role in a Great Library arc. Some details below. 

The Temple of the Order of the Twilight:

Session 9 started 4 days after the centaurs; during session 9 they traveled 5 days west, spend 1 day fighting, and traveled 5 days back to Voltara, so it is now 16 days since the centaurs (at the start of session 10).

Backstory: the Order of Twilight was a monastic order of healers and hospice care associated with the Night Queen. They were particularly prevalent in Amani, and were thus heavily impacted by the Blood Years. However, a few small pockets of members survived and the Order is now growing again. Galius Filuso has been scouting, recruiting, and looking for lost Order sites in the North for a while.


Xameia: paladin of the Night Queen who betrayed the Order of Twilight, details in Great Library campaign

Xameia the Forsworn will not be satisfied until restitution is made for her sins. 
There are a bunch of options for this:

1. If the party donates 2,000 gp to Galius Filuso, or to the Night Queen, making it clear this is to help restore the Order of Twilight, Xameia can rest
2. If they find the desecrated monastery of the Order of Twilight which was the scene of the demon battle, clear the demons, and pay for the casting of a Hallow spell (1000 gp material components, 300 gp donation to a priest to cast it), that will also satisfy Xameia and let her rest.
3. If they make a donation to the Night Queen / Galius Filuso but it isn't 2000 gp, may add a quest in addition
4. They could come up with something else, but in general should cost between 1000 and 2000 gp, with amounts on the lower end resulting in also needing some kind of quest / task

If they don't complete this in 30 days, they will start to have nightmares of Xameia. Get about a week of leeway where the only real penalty is loss of downtime, then escalate. Next week is Wisdom saving throws to avoid exhaustion, and the following week Xameia appears to fight them.

Once this is complete, they will have gained an ally in Galius Filuso and the priests of the Night Queen / Order of Twilight, who can speak on their behalf with the Proconsul.

Seems to be part of name, and their of pieces of what might say "Dedicated by Xameia, Protector of Evensong and Dusk Guide of the Night Queen."

On success, portal will vanish, area will begin to heal, and Xameia will rest.

The Night Queen will appear to each of them, and give each an appropriate blessing:

For Brelith, dedicated servant of my Dwarven brethren and friend of the Wildling. To you I give the blessing of my ear. You may ask me in prayer a question that I can answer with a single word, and I will answer truthfully to the best of my knowledge. I grant you my attention thrice before it warns. You can ask three questions -- at same or different time -- and then the blessing ends, as the commune spell

For Aelar, who hides between darkness and light, where I also dwell, and who has forged a long road through suffering and war to find strength in the twilight. I grant you the blessing of the shadows. When you seek not to be seen, I will aid you if you falter. I can extend my protection over you 5 times before the blessing fades. A stealth roll less than 10 can be treated as a 10, until you have used this ability 5 times

For Adrik, stalwart warrior on the front lines of danger, I grant you my blessing of safety. Let the Night Queen watch over you in danger, and should you falter I will catch you. After receiving this blessing, when you drop to 0 hit points, the damage is negated. After using this blessing, it ends

For Samso, friend of wild things, kin to beasts, from a race that is no stranger to the power of dreams, I grant you some measure of control over my domain of sleep. I grant you my blessing of dreams. lets you cast the Dream spell once with no components, then the blessing ends

Will make an ally of the order of Twilight. They will give potions and other consumables when back in town, and also will assist with getting access to Voltara / favor with pro-consul.

Not much exists about the Order of Twilight except:

In a dragon hoard in the [[Blackwater Fens]]: Etched into the altar are the words, "The treasures of the Order of Twilight will outlive their forgotten creators, turned to dust and rot."

**Xameia the Forsworn** was a Paladin of the Night Queen who lived several hundred years ago.  
She was a sworn member of a sacred order that protected shrines and religious orders. However, she betrayed them for money, and through her inaction, many people were slaughtered.

She is now cursed and oathsworn. To rest, she needs to restore a shrine that was desecrated by fiends.

**Order of Twilight** â†’  
Protected and aided those between life and death, the sick, old, infirm.  
Hospice; safe place to pray and heal or die as the gods willed.

Many would leave us gold, or land. I was weak and jealous of those with riches and power.  
Slew my fellow acolytes, took the gold, and ran, burning our temple behind me.

My god forsook me, and I was caught and killed for my crimes.  
But I cannot rest until the temple I destroyed is restored.
