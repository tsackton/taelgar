# The Wanderer
>[!info]+ Summary  
> he/him

%% vibes and notes:

- on Circular Island, one thing that was maybe not clear as a player is that the Wanderer was seen as guiding the overall pilgrimage enterprise, hence the port growing up around / near the statue of the Wanderer. Ties into general association with journey, but also i think this tradition would continue and the wanderer is thought to watch over pilgrimages generally
- I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large
- the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal
- Mike: I have some significant in-game experience with wanderer as one of my players is a paladin of the wanderer, some of which is worth capturing here 
- *needs some thought about holy symbol *

A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale. He is the god of travel, trade, and hospitality, and also strangers, outcasts, the downtrodden and those at the edge of society, by choice or birth. He is associated with the stars, and the virtues of charity and hospitality, and watches over journeys, markets, and inns.

In many lands, it is traditional for [[Mos Numena]] temples to have a small room or cot for travelers, known as The Wanderer's Cot. 

%% In mechanical terms, his clerics would usually be associated with the Peace or Knowledge domains, or perhaps the Trickster or Life domains. %%
