A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Father is usually depicted as an older man, usually seated, often in gray robes and with gray or white hair, sometimes holding a scepter or staff with a sun motif on the top. He is the God of order, light, and the sun. He is usually associated with summer, and the rising sun, and dawn, and the virtues of justice and fairness. He watches over the trials and judgment, the swearing of oaths, and government.

His holy symbol is a scepter with a sun, with rays radiating out from the sun. This is usually depicted as a simple line with a circle, with rays coming from the circle.

In mechanical terms, his clerics would usually be associated with the Light or Order domains.

%% a few notes:
- associated with the Radiant Path and the religious resistance to Apollyon's rule in Drankor. Whether this is echoing effects into the present day is unclear / undecided. 
- another of the fairly impersonal of the divines
