# The Warlord
>[!info]+ Summary  
> he/him

%% vibes and notes
-  two major Warlord places I have are Cleenseau, which has a battle garrison army smithy vibe, and Veltor, which is also an ancient fortified place, but where the disciple of the warlord had more of a courage in the face of overwhelming odds vibe
 - expect the warlord is popular along the western wall, for example, and is often the soldier/battle/army patron, but that there is a deeper sense of courage and a steel spine and standing up for what is right no matter the cost
 - *we should remember not to totally forget about the smith/crafter aspect in play, as i like the vibe that the god of war is not just about destruction; note that the Shipwright's Guild in Tollen is associated with the Warlord (or at least are funding a new temple)*
 - *needs some thought about holy symbol*
 %%

A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Warlord is usually depicted as a man in his prime, armed and armored (the exact weapons vary among cultures), often mounted on a horse, usually strong. However, he is occasionally also depicted as a smith, working in his forge. He is the God of war, vengeance, smiths, iron, and the forge. He is associated with the heat of the day, and autumn, and the virtue of courage. He watches over battle and war, as well as crafters and especially smiths and metalworkers.

%%
In mechanical terms, his clerics would usually be associated with the War or Forge domains.
