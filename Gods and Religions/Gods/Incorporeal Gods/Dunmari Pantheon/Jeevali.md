> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

One of [[Dunmari Religion|the Five Siblings]] of the Dunmari religion, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

Jeevali is the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family. Often seen as the eldest and most important of [[Dunmari Religion|the Five Siblings]], a first among equals. The peacemaker between the sometimes fractious relationships among the four other siblings, and often the deity looked to first in times of trouble. Seen as the mother of [[Dunmar]], along with [[Bhishma]], and as the guardian of the land of Dunmar, which is often seen as Jeevali's land. She is the one who chose the Dunmari for their great purpose and gave them land to live in, and made it safe, and now ensures the monsoon rains come when they should and in season. She especially watches over births, the home and family, and the harvest. 

Jeevali is intimately tied with [[Founding of Dunmar]], and her feast day, the [[Gods and Religions/Holidays and Festivals/Dunmari Festivals/Festival of Rebirth]], celebrates also the events of [[Dunmar]]'s founding. Her role in ensuring the monsoon is also celebrated on the [[Day of Renewal]].
