The [[Tanshi]] of crisp, cold weather, frosty mornings and autumn rains. Particularly fond the first frost of the year, when it is said they exert all their power to listen everywhere. Associated with the clear thoughts of a sharp, crisp morning.

One of the [[Meswati]], the lost tanshi, trapped during the [[Great War]] and silent since. 

%%^Date:1748-11-01^%%
In the fall of 1748 DR, Yalik'i was [[Session 54 (DuFr)|freed]] by [[Delwath]], [[Aristaea]], and [[Iascaire]] from imprisonment in one of [[Cha'mutte]]'s shadow realms.
