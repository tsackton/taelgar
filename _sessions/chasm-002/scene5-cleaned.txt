DM: As you walk ahead, you expect to come out into a corner with another passage across—but instead you step into a circular, snow-choked chamber. There’s one exit directly across from you, one to the left, and one to the right.
Jrain: Like cardinal-point spacing?
DM: Yep.
Finnan: Finnan will say, “I don’t think the path we take through this labyrinth matters whatsoever.”
Jrain: Nope.
Finnan: “Because every single time we go somewhere, it changes. But I like right. So let’s just go right.”
Justas: “Like… right?”
DM: As you turn to the right, the tunnel narrows. Ahead, thin sheets of ice hang from the ceiling like delicate curtains—layer after layer. The wind still howls, though it’s calmer than before, and snow still blows everywhere. The veils don’t fully block the corridor, but they mostly cover it. Cool mist pools beneath them. You could push through, though you’d likely break the sheets.
Finnan: Does anybody have a magical way to make fire?
Justas: “Lane McCreat’s… flame-like radiance,” so I’m gonna say… no…
DM: You need your spellcaster to wake up and mention he has *Create Bonfire* as a cantrip.
Eolo: Hmph. Nice.
Finnan: Kong! Now he’s fast asleep.
Jrain: Are we wrapping up?
Finnan: Ekko, can you make us a fire?
DM: Yeah. Neat.
Finnan: (OOC) I’m muted.
Ekko: (OOC) Sorry, guys. I got two hours of sleep last night, so I’m, like, exhausted.
DM: No, no, it’s okay. What was the request?
Finnan: Fire.
Ekko: Yeah, sure. I can do that.
DM: You have *Create Bonfire* as a cantrip, so you can literally just create a fire. Where do you want it? There are these thin sheets of ice.
Finnan: Try and melt the ice.
Ekko: Sure. See what happens. Maybe I’ll make it angry.
Finnan: Right.
Ekko: I like to sell that.
DM: So you’re using the bonfire to melt the ice directly.
Ekko: Unless… yeah, sure. Why not? Let’s start there and see what happens.
DM: The ice starts to melt. You put the bonfire right up against it—cracks spider out, and pieces fall and shatter *loudly*, much louder than they should. Then you hear a much, much louder crack as a huge section of ice crashes down—part of the wall collapses open.
DM: Darkness yawns beyond. A wind suddenly starts coming from behind you, roaring through the breach—and when you look back, you see something like an avalanche surging toward you.
Finnan: Let’s run forward.
Ekko: Avalanche?
DM: Forward, you’ve still got the ice veils and falling chunks. You could try to run through the remaining sheets, or jump into the darkness where the wall collapsed.
Ekko: Damn. Hey, is it, like, sentient ice? Can we talk to it?
DM: You haven’t tried. Tim has a magic item that lets him talk to objects, but he hasn’t used it.
Ekko: Let’s pray to it—ask it why!
DM: At the moment, you have about one second to decide: let the avalanche hit you, try to run through the ice sheets, or jump into the darkness.
Ekko: Run through the ice sheets.
Finnan: Ice sheets.
Eolo: Ice sheets, yeah.
DM: Okay. You smash into the sheets of ice. As you break through one, another seems to form; you make some progress, but ice keeps falling in front of you, and you can feel the avalanche getting closer. Then another crash—now the wall to your right collapses too. You’re standing on snow that seems supported by nothing, with ice veils in front of you and an avalanche behind you.
Ekko: Cool.
Jrain: Well, now we get to go right, because we love going right.
Justas: Yeah. Into the darkness. This is the time.
Ekko: Let’s talk to the ice—
Finnan: I don’t think we have time right now.
DM: That would’ve been a good idea maybe 45 minutes ago.
Ekko: Dammit.
DM: You jump down into the darkness—and you slide.
Finnan: So the light spell goes out?
DM: No, no, no—your light is still there. You can see each other, but you don’t see *anything else*. Whatever you’re standing on doesn’t reflect light. It’s like slick, non-reflective black ice under your feet, steep enough that as soon as you’re on it, you’re sliding.
Finnan: What do we see in a 40-foot radius?
DM: Blackness. You can see each other in your light, but there’s nothing to see beyond that—just the slope and the feel of that slick surface under your boots.
DM: You slide down like an ice chute for about 20 feet, and then you come out through the side of a wall—suddenly into open air—about 20 feet up in a large chamber, maybe 100 feet across, though you can’t see more than 40 feet. There’s no storm here. The walls near you are sheer ice; the floor below looks like black stone. Farther off, you can make out a boulder fall.
DM: And you’re falling. You have one second to do something.
Ekko: Fly my wings. I’m not falling—fly.
Justas: I smash my axe into the nearest ice wall and grab Kalima with my other arm.
DM: Okay—make a Strength check.
Justas: That is… 13?
DM: You catch the wall, but you don’t quite get a good bite—this is hard ice. Do you want to use Bardic Inspiration?
Justas: Yeah. What’s the die—d6? d8?
Finnan: (OOC) It’s a d8.
Justas: That is a 5, so… 18 altogether.
DM: DC was 15. Thinking of Finnan’s stories of heroic conquest, you dig in and your axe bites. You’re hanging about 17 feet up, holding Kalima with one arm and your axe with the other. It’ll hold, but not comfortably—maybe half a minute, maybe a minute.
DM: Jrain—any ideas?
Jrain: I’m grabbing at the wall as I go over—trying to catch purchase, climb, anything.
DM: It’s pretty smooth ice, but you can try. Make a Dex check. If you’ve got a climbing background, you can add proficiency.
Jrain: I do, in fact, have a story about how I used to climb all over the place.
DM: Sold. Dex check, plus proficiency.
Jrain: I got an 18 on D&D Beyond, plus 3… so 21?
DM: You manage to turn the fall into a controlled descent—catching little imperfections and guiding yourself down until you land on the black stone floor with a solid, stable footing.
DM: So: Jrain is on the ground. Justas is about 17 feet up. Ekko is flying. Finnan—
Finnan: I’m trying to grab a kenku as I slide out.
DM: Okay—make a Dex check.
Finnan: 21.
DM: Wow. Finnan grabs Eolo’s leg as Eolo catches air. It’s awkward flying with Finnan hanging on, but the air is strangely quiet here, and you stabilize.
Finnan: (telepathically to Eolo) We’ve practiced this twice now. By the third time, we’re gonna be brilliant.
Finnan: Please land.
DM: Ekko, you can pick up Kalima if you want.
Justas: Grab her! I’ll call over.
Ekko: I fly over and grab her.
DM: Kalima looks at Justas, then at Ekko—suspicious. “He dropped me last time.”
Ekko: (OOC) Ekko whispers, “I only eat humans per dinner.”
DM: Kalima doesn’t speak Kenku. You can say whatever you want.
Finnan: Believe it or not, I’ve been in this situation before. You’re in good hands.
DM: Kalima seems willing to be carried—until she looks down again and starts scrambling away from the center of the room.
DM: “It’s here somewhere.”
Justas: What is?
DM: “A beast. Hide!”
Justas: Good! Finally.
Jrain: He can hide. We didn’t bring her along so she could join in the big battles.
Finnan: I’ll use *Minor Illusion* to extend the ice wall by five feet, right below Justas—give Kalima somewhere to duck behind. It only lasts a minute, but it’s not concentration, so I can refresh it with an action if I need to.
DM: She’ll hide behind the illusory ice wall. How’s Justas getting down—just dropping?
Justas: Yeah. When Justas hears there’s a beast in here, he smiles broadly, wiggles his axe loose, and drops to the ground ready for a fight.
DM: You’re dropping about 10 feet. Make a Dex save.
Justas: What if I use Strength?
DM: No—Dex save. If you fail you take 3 damage; if you succeed, none.
Justas: I rolled a 3, so…
DM: You take 3 damage and land awkwardly—bruise something.
Justas: Says Justas: “That’s what happened last time, too.”
DM: You’re in a circular chamber. The floor is black stone. On the far side, scattered rocks and a boulder fall block your view.
Justas: Justas smashes his battleaxe against his shield as loudly as he can and bellows, “Show yourself!”
DM: You hear a roar. And for the cliffhanger: from behind the rocks emerges a 10-foot-tall shaggy white beast with dark red eyes. It shrieks—a hideous yell of pain and anger.
DM: At the same time, near the walls, ice starts to creep and thicken. Shadowy shapes form as frost gathers—one near each of you—ice swelling into shaggy, bestial forms beneath each of the kenku.
Finnan: Quick question before we end: if we fight this creature, does it count as a beast you have hunted? I’ve been saving my charges—I want to use all five to learn three true facts about Zeyfa’s minion. The item says “a beast you have hunted or fed.”
DM: Fighting would definitely count as hunted.
Eolo: Maybe we should feed it.
Justas: Did we already feed it with our blood?
DM: Not yet. And sure—I’m not sure I intended it to apply to monstrous creatures, but why not? Yes, it counts as hunted.
Finnan: Okay, so we’re stopping there.
DM: Yeah.
Jrain: Unless we think the creature would like a goodberry.
Justas: Maybe what they really need are friends.
Ekko: We should’ve just talked to it from the beginning, and then it would’ve been cool.
