Ekko: Alright.
DM: Did you take the… you took—did you get 6 points of damage? Yes. Okay.
Ekko: Alright, so I’m going to… move the intangible pack… it’s over here. So this… oh, wait. Should do this. I’ll get all four of these guys, right?
Finnan: Well, it’s when it moves through, so… yeah, it’ll hit all four of those.
Ekko: Okay, so I do that. So everybody’s gotta roll—make a Dex save.
DM: So, R dodges out of the way. K does not make its save. E dodges out of the way, and F… again, as you… as the spirits come past it, it almost, like… the snow swirls around it and almost, like, blocks that—blocks the animals. And it… and it… doesn’t… it doesn’t take any damage.
Ekko: Alright, but I still roll 3d10, though, right?
DM: Yes. It’s per—K. K failed.
Ekko: Okay, so I rolled a 14.
DM: Okay.
Ekko: And then… now I can attack. I can still attack.
Finnan: Don’t bother attacking K, because it’s going to spend its entire next turn running away.
DM: So, attack somebody else.
Ekko: How about E?
Finnan: Is good.
Ekko: Alright, I’m already in melee with E. Alright, so now, for attack, I have d20 plus 7… give me a moment here… first attack…
Ekko: 18.
DM: As you swing at it and your claw, like, feels like it’s sliding into the snow, but then the snow it’s sliding into just isn’t there anymore all of a sudden.
Ekko: 18 doesn’t hit?
DM: There’s a…
Ekko: That’s sad.
DM: Gotta listen to my narration.
Ekko: What am I supposed to do if I—
DM: Now, bow.
DM: I’m not gonna tell you.
Ekko: Let me see.
DM: I can attack it again.
Ekko: Yeah, that’s my… I’m gonna try to do that. Let’s see…
Ekko: I rolled another… oh, I rolled on all… well, wait, alright—another 18.
DM: Again, it seems like… like, as your claw comes towards it, it, like… this time, it’s… it’s… ice—its body sort of stiffens, and the force of your blow bounces off it.
Ekko: What’s going on, guys?
DM: Oh, and then… it… it, like… a deep cold starts spreading from around it, and at the end of your turn, you take 3 points of cold damage, which is halved to 1.
DM: The beast looks at… Justas. With its icy gaze. Make a Con saving throw.
Justas: I’m saving throw… 17.
DM: 17. Justas stares the beast down, and it… breaks its gaze first, turning away in shame as it cannot… break your will.
Justas: “Not so,” mutters Justas under his breath.
DM: This one has to run away. Away from what, Finnan?
Finnan: Yeah.
DM: It can’t really run away from you.
DM: Where do you want it to go?
Finnan: I mean, just run around the… it has to… it has to end its turn as far away from me as it can.
DM: Okay. D&D Beyond is about to break my computer. What’s—stop it! Is somebody al—what is… what is going on? Is somebody else moving it? It’s just very scary. I’m not moving it!
Justas: It’s… it’s running.
DM: I…
Finnan: It’s running!
DM: It’s, like, literally appears to be possessed. I do not know what’s happening.
Eolo: Oh my god.
DM: I’m not moving it.
Finnan: Here, it was here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I don’t know what the…
DM: Yeah, that’s… dirty.
Finnan: 7, 8, 9.
DM: 30 feet, though. 6, 6, 6, 6.
Finnan: It’s devastating.
DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Finnan: Okay. That’s about as far away from me as it can get.
DM: Save it that square.
Finnan: Because I’m not cap—polar bear gets a—
DM: I can make any type of opportunity, yep.
Justas: Dump it.
Finnan: And—
Ekko: Come on! Dammit! 16.
DM: 16.
Ekko: 17.
DM: That—again, it’s like, as it’s flying by you, it, like… its icy body, like, thickens, and your claw bounces off it.
Ekko: Resistance to my attacks?
Finnan: It also has to… it also has to make a Dex save for the conjure.
DM: I didn’t.
Finnan: Well, because it crosses through the conjure field, so it enters a space that’s within—
DM: No, that’s not how Conjure Animals. If you start your turn in the conjure, you only take damage if you also end your turn in the conjure.
Finnan: Okay.
DM: That’s how you always ran Conjure Animals, or dealt with it, at least. And that’s always made sense to me, because otherwise it would be too—
Finnan: You’re supposed—
DM: To be able to escape.
Finnan: You can escape it on your turn if you run away from it. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
DM: Okay, R steps here and flings a thought—Jrain, you take 6 points of cold damage.
Jrain: Is… it slings?
DM: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on—sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry—wrong R, wrong R.
Justas: What’s the one—
Finnan: Generally are.
Justas: Maybe that’s it.
DM: That.
Jrain: That was odd.
DM: Wait.
Finnan: It should be the one next to Justas, that’s all.
DM: It is, yeah, correct. That’s… that’s supposed to be. I… they’re backwards on my thing, but it’s the one next to Justas. What, Tracy?
Justas: One.
DM: So that misses. Its second attack also misses. And it… screams at you with a distracting howl. Make a con—make a concentration check.
Justas: What is that? Is that a Kensei.
DM: Fine, yeah, yeah.
Justas: Yeah, that’s a 4. I don’t think the inspiration’s gonna help.
Finnan: Unlikely to. Just retest Spirit Guardians.
Justas: Exactly. That’s—
DM: Spell effect drops. And it’s your turn.
Justas: Justas glares at the emanation—or at the snow next to him. I think it makes more sense to recast Spirit Guardians and to walk to the right, because I can get all four of the living snows with it, and conceivably do a bonus attack. Does that—
Finnan: Yeah, that seems plausible. Although I’m… yeah. I mean, the living snows are killable, so… that’s good to know.
Justas: Did we figure out the pattern for when they do and don’t take damage?
Finnan: No.
Justas: I mean—
Finnan: They’ve taken damage. One of them was killed by the sprite. They’ve not taken damage from any of the weapon attacks, except that—
Jrain: Any of those specially charged. The specially charged arrow that… Eolo used did some damage, right?
Finnan: The— the psionic did damage, but the arrow didn’t. Rala damaged them.
Jrain: Yeah.
Finnan: The polar bear has kept missing, but I don’t know if that’s just because they have a really high AC.
DM: They all… they all seem— I mean, they almost seem, each one, to be, like… slightly… similar. Like, the one that appeared by Jrain had a slightly echoey look of Jrain, the one that appeared by Finnan had a slightly echoey look of Finnan, etc. They all seemed to almost be slightly… like, they reminded you of yourself just a little bit.
Justas: That is very useful, but not enough of a hint for my slow brain.
Jrain: Try hurting somebody else’s one?
Finnan: Yeah, I mean—
Justas: Yeah, I like that. I’m gonna recast Spirit Guardians.
Finnan: Spirit Guardians plus bonus action attack is your best move here.
DM: I—
Finnan: I think… they seem to have been protecting the beast, so I think we’ve gotta… I don’t think we can just ignore them and attack the beast.
Justas: Alright, I cast Spirit Guardians!
DM: Okay.
Justas: So it’s back up again.
DM: I probably should have deleted it.
Justas: The guy next to me makes a save, and then I am headed… headed off. I’m a happy little adventurer.
DM: Okay. Okay, so the guy next to you makes what kind of save?
Justas: 14… DC 14 Wisdom. Okay.
DM: I brought an agent—oh, and then you go over here. Hold on a second, hold on. The one marked R, as the Spirit Guardians go past it… it’s almost like—well, let’s see. It tries to step out of the way, and it’s almost like the snow around it entangles it and trips it. And it cannot escape the Spirit Guardians.
Finnan: So they still have, like, half damage if they make the save, by the way.
DM: Wow, okay. So—
Justas: Oh, that’s my bad from last round, I missed that.
Jrain: Yeah, that’s a great thing about Spirit Guardians.
DM: Yeah, okay. So, tell me how the half damage— the one—
DM: The one at the bottom? It just pushes the guardians away, and it takes no damage.
Justas: Alright, how about… let’s see, how about E?
DM: And E.
Justas: I’m getting close to E.
DM: E fails its save.
Justas: Okay. How many 3d8s do you need me to roll?
DM: Just one. I mean, it can be the same— you don’t need to roll it separately for all of them. Good, that’s solid damage. I’ll take—yeah, I’ll take that. Let’s see—made its save, hold on.
DM: That one of them—the one that was next to you—dies.
Justas: Yay!
DM: What kind of damage is it?
Finnan: Radiant.
DM: And you said it was 16 damage?
Justas: Yep.
DM: And… wait, what did I—did I say E made its save, or… I can’t remember. One of them—
Justas: But E failed, F made it.
DM: Yes.
Justas: R and E failed.
DM: Yep, so they all take damage. Except F, which seems not to take any damage, somehow.
Justas: Good to know. And then I… bonus action attack E with my battleaxe, and roll a 23.
DM: 23… hold on.
Finnan: They’re, like, here.
DM: 23 hits.
Justas: Oh, good. Great. That is… 10 points of slashing damage.
DM: Okay.
Justas: Does it appear to take the damage?
DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You— you… as you end your turn there, you take 6 points of cold damage. Awesome. Eolo’s turn.
Finnan: Eric, you there?
Jrain: He’s… he left a note saying, “baby.”
DM: Reset.
Jrain: He left.
DM: Do you want to just roll for him?
Finnan: Sure.
DM: Go ahead.
Ekko: Digital.
Finnan: Why doesn’t… why doesn’t Eolo attack—
DM: R or F.
Finnan: Or keep attacking the beast. But I think the beast has a higher AC the more of these snow creatures are around.
Ekko: Who’s he attacking?
Finnan: Hey, attack F.
Ekko: 17 plus something—plus a modifier.
DM: 17 hits. The arrow just flies past its defenses—
Ekko: How much damage?
DM: 1d—wow.
Finnan: 1d6 plus 4.
DM: And this is piercing damage, right?
Ekko: Yep. 6—10, hell yeah!
Justas: Nice.
Ekko: Killing, killing you.
DM: The arrow just flies through it, and, like, pieces of ice come flying off the thing—pieces of snow come flying off the thing. Like, it’s just like… it does way more damage than you’d expect.
Finnan: Do it again with advantage.
Ekko: With advantage, so I roll 2d20s?
DM: Yeah.
Finnan: Two d20s, yup.
Ekko: Yeah, 16 is my highest one.
DM: Seems fine.
Finnan: So, 23.
DM: Yeah—nope, that 16 was enough to—
Finnan: Actually, it should be higher than that. It’s plus 9.
DM: Yeah, 16 hits. And then how much damage?
Finnan: 1d6 plus 4 again, yep.
Ekko: 7 damage.
DM: Again, it… it goes— the arrow goes flying through it, like… like a whirlwind, and the whole thing just collapses.
Finnan: Oh, Vex chain is over. Go for… I can’t remember which ones are the most damaged. Go for… go for R—failed to save on Spirit Guardians, right?
Justas: I think E may be more dangerous.
Finnan: E might be more damaged. Go for E.
Ekko: Who are you talking to?
Justas: One more crossbow bolt?
Finnan: One more—
Ekko: On this one. Eolo’s attacked twice.
DM: You get the third.
Finnan: Eolo gets 3 attacks with a bonus action. I might have to, like, fly down to here or something so that we have a clear shot around the polar bear.
Ekko: This one’s not… no advantage on this one, though.
Finnan: No advantage, because the VEX chain’s over.
Ekko: Aw, man, luck can’t last forever. 7—so that’s plus 9… 16.
DM: That hits.
Ekko: Oh, shit!
Justas: Okay.
DM: The arrow— it’s almost like… it’s almost like the beast is… it, like… it’s like Eolo feels like there’s almost a bullseye painted on this guy.
Ekko: Smart image. Wait, so what is he… why is Eolo hitting everything and Ekko is missing everything?
Finnan: I think you’re not supposed to attack the one that’s assigned to you.
Ekko: Hmm…
DM: That one dies. Jrain, you’re up.
Jrain: Alright! I send my… for Rala to attack Snow R.
DM: Okay.
Jrain: That is… a…
Jrain: 15 plus the thing that I’m supposed to add. Which is my… God only knows what—some number on this stupid sheet. Anyway—
DM: That helps. 15 plus something, yeah, because this is melee attack, right?
Jrain: Yeah.
DM: Yep, that hits.
Jrain: Alright, so it does the 1d4 plus 9, is it?
DM: Yep.
Jrain: So that’s 2 plus… that’s 11.
DM: Who has auto-win? That’s your fae.
Finnan: That’s my fae.
DM: How much damage, Kate? 11, you said?
Jrain: 11.
DM: Okay.
Jrain: Alright.
DM: That’s one— that’s your bonus action.
Jrain: It’s a bonus action. Then I… what do we think? Should I keep going after the snow, or go after the beast? You’ve got—no, go after the beast. You’ve got Hunter’s Mark on the beast. That’s what I thought, but… alright, yes. My Hunter’s Mark and I are going to attack the beast with my longbow.
DM: Hold on a—
Finnan: Maybe, maybe retreat a little bit. Also—
Jrain: My first roll was only a 15.
DM: That misses.
Jrain: Yep, so… did my next attack—
DM: Wait—oh yeah, you used your bonus action for your… for your beast. That’s 20. That hits.
Jrain: Alright.
DM: Finnan and then Ekko.
Jrain: So that’s… 9 from the longbow. And… isn’t there something from the Hunter’s Mark?
Finnan: 2d6.
DM: Anyway.
Jrain: Which is just a 1. Okay.
DM: All right. Okay. Tim? Finnan?
Finnan: So, I will use my Dissonant Whispers using… yeah, that’s fine. Using the— not a spell slot—just using the Fey Touched ability. Targeting the last living snow—trying to… well, the last one that’s here, close by—trying to make it run. That’s a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
DM: Targeting R—
Finnan: R, yep.
DM: It fails.
Finnan: Okay, so it takes… 15 points of—wait, 10 points of psychic damage, and it has to use its reaction, if available, to—again.
DM: Oh, it’s dead. Yep, it’s dead.
Finnan: Okay, never mind then.
DM: Never mind its reaction.
Finnan: Congratulations.
DM: Die.
Finnan: If I will… not use my bonus— is anybody wounded?
Justas: Not really.
DM: Doesn’t hurt?
Finnan: Who?
DM: Jrain’s pretty badly hurt. Yeah, I have 20 out of my 52 hit points. Justas is reasonably badly hurt.
Finnan: I’ll use a bonus action Healing Word. Since that wasn’t a spell slot. So that’s gonna be—
DM: Oh!
Finnan: That was—
DM: Really bad, right?
Finnan: 7 points of healing for—
DM: Don, what… what’s Ekko doing?
Jrain: Thank you.
Ekko: So, I, I need—
Jrain: Feel the warmth.
Ekko: I need to change my strategy here, because whoever I was attacking, I keep missing no matter what I roll. I don’t know about myself.
Finnan: Go run and attack the beast.
DM: They’re kind of all dead now, except for the beast, and one hiding. Alright.
Ekko: I will do that. I will… well, actually, let me first move… my thing into the beast.
Finnan: And just jump on top of it with your jump.
Ekko: Yeah, and I will… well, let me… let me do the first… the… so Dex save for the beast.
Finnan: Oh, yeah.
DM: What, it’s DC 15?
Ekko: Yep.
DM: 15—it makes DC 15. RIP.
Ekko: Alright, then, Ekko will pounce on the beast.
DM: Okay.
Ekko: And—
DM: For—
Ekko: I don’t have advantage or anything, right?
DM: Nope.
Ekko: Alright, first attack… plus 7—give me something good… 20.
DM: That hits.
Ekko: Yes, and I do dA plus 5… so that does… 8 points of damage. Second attack… 20 again!
DM: Is that it?
Ekko: And then… I do another… 6 points of damage.
DM: Okay. The beast stands up, and it… it…
DM: It… let’s see—
Finnan: Can you end your turn slightly around the corner, so Justas has room to move into melee if he wants to? Like, she’s—
DM: Like, right there. As this last… snow beast, like, flows back to the beast, it, like… it seems to shake away from its distraction. Like it was, in some sense, keeping—maintaining—or using some of its energy to maintain these things. And it lashes out with a—first of all, it stares at… Finnan. Make a Con saving throw.
Finnan: I’m gonna use Lucky to roll with advantage.
Finnan: Didn’t need the advantage. 22.
DM: For the third time in a row, somebody stares down the beast and shakes off whatever this chilling gaze is. But then… it… hurls ice—shards, Finnan. As this bulk of ice comes flying at you, you take 12 points of cold damage—18 points, sorry—18 points of cold damage. And… it… throws another, like—ice is just, like, falling off its body—and it hurls another thing of ice—shards—at Ekko, at Eolo. Let me know you—oh, no, I know yours, AC. 16. So Eolo takes…
DM: 16 points of cold damage.
DM: And… it ends its turn. Kalima hides. Justas!
Justas: I will move first. Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… which means the emanations hit the beast.
Finnan: Set, yep.
DM: Sorry, what’s the—
Justas: DC 14 Wisdom.
DM: I rolled a… yeah, April the 15th.
Justas: Bummer. And then—
DM: Right? Half damage.
Finnan: Captain.
DM: Half damage it takes.
Justas: I do, that’s right. Let me roll that real quick.
DM: And hold on, did I… did I forget to—did you do the… I can’t remember if I rolled for the—
Finnan: What? I also forgot the fae spirit’s turn on my last turn, but that’s okay, that’s my problem.
DM: You said it was 16 halved, is it 8?
Justas: 15.5 is 8, yeah.
DM: Yeah.
Justas: Radiant?
Finnan: 16.5 to 17.
DM: 15.5 to 7, but yeah, close.
Justas: Down rather than up, that’s a bummer.
DM: Everyone’s done. Okay.
Justas: Unless they’re attacking me, in which case, that’s very fair.
DM: Exactly.
Justas: And I’m now casting Guiding Bolt, and I will—let me think about that for a sec—I’m gonna upcast that at second level—
DM: So, make an attack roll—
Justas: I roll… 14? Is that a hit?
DM: Wait, no, no— that’s a—no.
Justas: Can I add my inspiration—my bardic?
DM: You can roll bardic dice, yeah. Yeah.
Justas: Why is that—
Finnan: But the— the—
Justas: 4.
DM: That hits!
Justas: So that’s 18 altogether. Great. That’s 5d8… that’s 21. And it is—
DM: Badly hurt at this point. Like, you can see ice is falling off it. It’s, like… it’s, like, limping, and… and, like… like steam is, like, almost—like cold frost is, like, coming out of it. That’s the end of your turn?
Justas: That’s it.
DM: Eolo.
DM: Eric’s—
Finnan: Oh, you wanna… you wanna roll for Eolo? We did well last time.
Jrain: You’re muted.
DM: But you’re muted.
Ekko: Okay, any—any advantage, or just rolling?
DM: Straight roll.
Finnan: So you roll for the first hit. If you hit, you can start the next chain.
DM: You have a plus 9. 17 plus 9—26. Badass.
Ekko: 6, plus—
DM: d6 plus 5, plus you can use a psychic Psionic die boost to do another d6, I think.
Ekko: 9 damage. Let’s do another d6 damage—hell yeah, another 5. That’s 11 damage. Second attack.
DM: No, it’s dead.
Ekko: Dude.
DM: Falls to the ground, as y’all—
Justas: Wow.
Ekko: Okay, Eolo’s kind of a G. I get it.
