DM: It… the ice cracks around it and it reels back; it's bloodied. And then, before Finnan gets a chance to move, coming flying from the side, this… this dark shadow, almost made of just wind, comes gusting in with this burst of wind. And it comes flying over here towards Finnan. And…
DM: I should just go grab my physical dice, that would be so much easier.
Jrain: Taking that.
DM: What is your AC, Tim?
Finnan: 13.
DM: 13.
Finnan: But I do have Cutting Words, so I can use a reaction to make it subtract.
unknown_speaker{DM}: It's…
DM: It's…
Finnan: Second.
DM: This… this wa—this… it just… it's like—are you using that? It's… it's just barely grazing, like, this—
Finnan: Well, are you gonna… are you gonna play the way I play and let you know what the roll is?
DM: Oh, wow.
Finnan: You cast *Shield*.
DM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, it hits. It hit. Yeah, it hit by one.
Finnan: I'm… yes, I'm… I'm disturbed by this situation, so I am going to Cutting Words.
DM: Okay, it'll definitely—
Finnan: I will—
DM: —Words.
Finnan: Yeah, yeah, I will use a Bardic Inspiration to just speak, again, like, a warding curse against the west wind, and deflect its attack.
unknown_speaker{DM}: A second one…
DM: …comes off.
Finnan: Of course!
DM: You're the only one they can reach, unfortunately for you. A second one comes up and does the same thing. Again, this wind howl—
unknown_speaker{DM}: This one shrieks.
DM: This one stops right here and shrieks—lets forth this gust of wail, of just, like, this horrible noise of wind.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And Finnan…
DM: Justas and Jrain have to make a Wisdom save. Oh, but you have… your *Calm Emotions* is still up?
Finnan: Yep.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Okay.
Finnan: So… I'm at least immune to—well, I guess it depends on who…
DM: We'll—
Finnan: The woman is immune to *Calm Emotions*. I'm immune to *Calm Emotions*. I guess Justas would probably… or immune to fright. I guess Justas would probably know.
DM: Justas would know.
Finnan: Yeah. I don't know if Jrain or Ekko or Eolo would just be like, "Hey, this spell is great, I'm gonna…"
DM: Yeah, that's a good question. Actually, Eolo, Ekko, and Jrain, the weird bard sang a song that was a magical effect. Did you let it take effect? It seems to be something he was targeting at the Zimka woman. Did you let it take effect, or did you try and resist it?
Ekko: I tried to resist it.
DM: Make a…
unknown_speaker{DM}: Charisma saving throw, Tim? No, Wisdom.
Finnan: I'm gonna save.
DM: That's crazy.
Ekko: Charisma save?
Jrain: I went with it. I could tell what he was doing, and I know him a little bit, and…
DM: Yeah, you could have let it happen.
Ekko: 13. I failed anyway.
DM: Okay.
Ekko: Eric, I was calmed?
DM: It means you're immune to fright, which is useful, because you're about to get a fright effect hitting you. Well, not you, actually, because you're not in the cone.
Eolo: I…
unknown_speaker{Eolo}: Of course.
Eolo: So, my rolls have been 1, 2, and 20. Twenty, of course, was for my roll to resist the buff.
DM: So, you shake off the weird spell, but Jrain, Finnan, and Justas still need to make a Wisdom save.
Finnan: I rolled a 4.
DM: Okay, so you take 5 points of psychic damage.
Jrain: I rolled an 11.
DM: You also take 5 points of psychic damage.
Ekko: I think your rolls are in character. This is perfect.
Finnan: I'm gonna—
Eolo: So far.
Finnan: Schwartz, what'd you get?
Justas: What did I get?
DM: Wisdom.
Justas: 12.
DM: 12! Wow, you guys are really rolling poorly. That's your roll—that's with your plus, right? You also take 5 points of psychic damage.
Finnan: I'm giving myself advantage on the… on the Concentration check. With Luck.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Okay.
DM: Which means you succeed. However, none of you are scared of the thing.
unknown_speaker{DM}: It seems terrifying, but you just feel very calm.
DM: And it really doesn't bother you that it seems terrifying. Bam.
unknown_speaker{DM}: However, the Zimka woman falls to the ground.
DM: Bhh.
unknown_speaker{DM}: I mean, she also took the psychic damage, but probably doesn't have that many hit points.
Finnan: I mean, she falls to the ground, as in she's unconscious, or…
DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Finnan: Okay.
unknown_speaker{DM}: She's… she's unconscious.
DM: And… the other wolf…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …comes charging.
DM: 1, 2, 3—Justas! It charges towards you…
DM: What is your AC?
Justas: T—
Ekko: You have a 19 AC? That's pretty sweet.
DM: It just… it comes up towards you, and it just… it… it… just… its claws, or its bite, you just… you just casually push it aside with your shield. Like, "What, are you gonna bite me through the shield? No, you're not." I shake my head.
Justas: A bit disappointed.
DM: It's Finnan's turn.
Finnan: I am going to… let's see… where can I go? I will bonus… let's see…
DM: And Schwartz, you're next, and then Eolo goes again.
Finnan: There's nowhere good. Is this the edge of the platform here? Like…
DM: Are you—
Finnan: The edge of the platform is what's shown on the map, there's not any other space?
DM: Correct. Correct.
Finnan: Okay.
DM: These—
Finnan: …things, the shades, just came from off the platform?
DM: Yeah, yeah, they're flying. They're, like… they're almost more wind than shadow. And they came drifting from… they just came blowing in on the wind from off the platform.
Finnan: Okay. It's not a great spot for me to go, but I am going to bonus action… hope Justas can keep this occupied, and Misty Step to… what is going on here? Okay. Where was I? 1, 2, 3… 4… 5… 6. I'm gonna… so…
DM: Is that one that has verbal components?
Finnan: I'm using… I'm casting it without a spell slot. I'm using my Fey Touched—
DM: Okay.
Finnan: Bonus action. So I'm going to vanish and reappear over there. And then… so let me mark off that.
Finnan: Okay, Finnan is scared. I don't like this. And begins chanting again, playing on his little flute, actually. And… do I have to make a roll?
DM: Are you casting a… what spell are you casting?
Finnan: *Mirror Image*.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Yes. The wind, again, blows down. Every time… like, it seems like when you're trying to summon strong magical effects, there's this…
DM: This wind comes and tries to steal your—
unknown_speaker{DM}: —don't falter at all.
Finnan: And you now see four Finnans next to each other.
Eolo: Whoa.
Finnan: All standing, looking at the wolves, unhappily.
DM: Justas?
unknown_speaker{Ekko}: I'm over at Justas, like, "What's going on, dude?"
Justas: That was mine.
Finnan: Bonus act— I can't give Inspiration a lot.
DM: Schwartz.
Justas: Justas touches on a necklace—a little bear figurine with the head of a wolf. He's casting *Spiritual Weapon*. Do I need to do anything, or the… that just… is the wind trying to steal my breath, or…
unknown_speaker{DM}: The wind does try and… yes—does it have verbal components?
Justas: It does have verbal components.
DM: I'm interested, so make a Con save.
Justas: Ugh, that's a 4.
unknown_speaker{DM}: So, you feel like a choking. You could definitely… you could… you could push through it.
DM: It would… it would hurt, but you could cast the spell anyway, or you could let the wind steal it.
Justas: No, that's just fine to hurt.
DM: You take 4 points of damage.
Justas: Awesome. Alright, and hoists his battleaxe, and then a glowing, bluish, identical copy of it appears next to him, and he swings with both of them at once. I'm using a bonus action.
DM: That's actually correct, yeah, yeah.
Justas: Regularly, yeah. So, alright.
DM: So you're—
Eolo: Where are all these extra people coming from?
Justas: 19?
DM: That hits.
unknown_speaker{DM}: That's 5 points of damage…
Justas: And then the Spiritual Weapon… same effect, that's 23…
DM: Yeah, that hits.
Eolo: I bet.
Justas: And that is 11 points of damage.
DM: Make a Dex save.
Justas: That is not a thing that I do. That's a 6.
DM: You take 2 points of cold damage as your weapons just smash into it, chipping away ice, and it shivers a little bit, and these shards of ice come flying at you and they just sneak through the cracks of your armor.
unknown_speaker{Justas}: Awesome.
DM: And Eolo, you're up. You can redeem yourself. You're on the ground, and the wolf is standing on top of you.
Eolo: Oh, do I have to take an action to get up again?
DM: If you want to stand up, you have to use half your move.
Eolo: Half my move to stand up. Okay, well…
DM: Also, you feel this… this fang that's stuck in your neck, and your neck pulses with cold, and you take 3 points of cold damage.
Eolo: Alright. I will fire my hand crossbow.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Are you switching weapons to your heavy crossbow, or you're doing your two light crossbows?
DM: You don't have a heavy crossbow.
Eolo: Oh, I was looking at the… they're only—
DM: …the thing… the push effect. I know, but you didn't keep your heavy crossbow. Remember, you only have the two things you held onto, which were your two hand crossbows.
Eolo: I thought I only had the two. Okay, I didn't know there was a different crossbow. Okay.
DM: Yeah, there's also a heavy crossbow, which… you might have. It's like a big thing. It's two-handed.
Eolo: I see, I didn't realize that.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Yeah.
Eolo: Anyways, I shoot with a crossbow.
DM: Standing up.
Eolo: Oh, I stand up first.
DM: Okay.
Eolo: Shoot with a crossbow, yes.
DM: 12 misses.
Eolo: And… I could shoot again.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Yep.
Eolo: 20.
DM: Two hits! You can act.
Eolo: That's… where's the damage there? But then… that's 5…
unknown_speaker{Finnan}: Add a d4 as well—
DM: d4 fire.
Eolo: …for the fire damage, yeah. How do I roll a d4 here?
DM: If you just click on the little dice icon in the bottom—oh, oh, on the character sheet, yeah. On the character sheet, you can just—so 3. So that was 8 total…
Finnan: Me, but you can use it.
DM: Just use Tim's.
Finnan: I was just showing how to roll it, but I realized it doesn't actually show you anything useful whatsoever.
DM: So… that was your two attacks. With your bonus action, you could make a third attack, or you could do something else.
Finnan: Remember, you've got advantage.
Eolo: So, yeah, yeah, but first… Immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one psionic energy die to deal 1d8—
DM: Yep.
Eolo: —free force damage. So that's 9 more.
DM: 9 more damage, okay. So, as Eolo shoots your remaining arrow, it flies towards the creature, and you just guide it unerringly with your psychic power, and it goes right through its head, and it falls down dead.
Eolo: Nice.
Justas: Nicely done, Justas calls out.
Eolo: Yeah. I will…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …use the rest of my move, which I should have, like, 15 feet left. Yep.
Eolo: But where should I go?
Finnan: Then I'll yell out, "Kill the other wolf!"
Ekko: Yeah. Go there, I have to… I have to go there to attack that one.
DM: You probably don't want to go too close to it. You don't need to be in melee, you have… you have crossbows.
Finnan: 30-foot range.
Eolo: But Eolo wants to be.
Finnan: Melee, obviously. You can come stand next to me.
Eolo: Oh, I can't get that far, though. I was, like, over here.
Finnan: You only have 15 feet, right?
Eolo: Yeah, I'll just… I'll go right there. And then… wait, do I have another action, you're saying? Because I have a bonus action.
DM: You have a bonus action, which you could use.
unknown_speaker{DM}: To make a second—because with two-weapon fighting, you can make a second attack with your bonus action.
DM: So you can shoot one crossbow each with your regular attack, and then you… somehow… you have a third hand. I don't know, I don't know how it works, but you somehow get a crossbow bolt out of your quiver and shoot a third time in the same—
Finnan: feat.
DM: That's what the feat is for, yes.
Eolo: Shoot a third time.
DM: That's right.
Eolo: 29. Now I'm rolling dice.
DM: There you go.
Eolo: That's right.
Finnan: Hey, that's a crit.
DM: You critted! So, did you… did you roll damage twice—roll damage again—and then also roll 2d4?
Eolo: A 7 and a 9, and then…
Finnan: Well, it's just a 5, so it's 12 plus 2d4.
Eolo: 5 is the 2d4.
DM: Okay.
DM: So… Eolo finishes your turn. Out of the… out of the body—out of… as this ice shatters—four little…
unknown_speaker{DM}: Four little…
DM: …motes, almost, of, like… of life? Wait, where is—so your light spell is…
Finnan: I don't know how to do ranges on here, it's 40 feet from me.
DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
unknown_speaker{DM}: One of these comes flying by Finnan.
DM: And as it gets close to you…
unknown_speaker{DM}: It darts towards your light, and it goes out.
Finnan: My light goes out?
unknown_speaker{DM}: Your *Light* spell vanishes, yes.
Eolo: Okay.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Whoa.
Finnan: So how dark is that?
DM: No, these two—this point right here is shedding dim light, and this point right here is shedding dim light. Here, let me put the…
DM: Everything that's now black…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …is dark. Does anybody have darkvision?
Finnan: That's why I have the *Light* spell.
Ekko: Can't Kenku have darkvision?
DM: Kenku don't have darkvision.
unknown_speaker{DM}: So, none of you have darkvision.
Jrain: Nope.
unknown_speaker{DM}: So basically, it reduces the vision to that. That's fine. And then…
Ekko: Ekko.
DM: Yeah, these guys are going. Two of them swarm by Ekko…
unknown_speaker{DM}: And one of them swarms…
DM: …towards Eolo.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And they are… as they swarm around you…
DM: These… they… they… actually, one swarms to each of you. All—Jrain, Eolo, and Ekko—all make a Constitution saving throw.
Jrain: Ugh.
Eolo: 23.
Ekko: 15.
DM: These… each one of them just, like, shimmers and shivers, and this burst of, like…
unknown_speaker{DM}: Ice?
DM: …comes flying out around your face.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Eolo and Ekko sort of blink and dodge in time. Jrain, you're blinded.
Eolo: Oh, great.
DM: And now it is Ekko's turn.
Ekko: Am I engaged with the two… the two things—the chippy, the wisps?
DM: Yeah, the Wisp is, like, buzzing around your head. Okay. It's only about the size of a robin.
Ekko: That's fine. Alright, I will… I will do a claw attack against the one that's buzzing me.
DM: Okay. Right.
Ekko: That is… 20.
DM: That hits.
Ekko: And… I do 2d6 plus 5. That's cool. Let's see, so… oh, 2, okay, there we go. 2d6… that's 8 plus 5—13?
Jrain: Well, it doesn't matter because I'm blinded, but it says that I do have darkvision. I don't know how, but it's right here under my saving throws are done with certain dice. I have passive Perception of 15 and darkvision of 60 feet.
Eolo: O?
Jrain: But I'm blind. I don't know.
Finnan: Wait, where do you get the darkvision from?
Jrain: I don't know, maybe I took a feat, God only knows. I'm just reading my sheet.
Eolo: How does D&D work?
Finnan: It doesn't say—dark… are you… Mike can… I don't think you have darkvision.
DM: Maybe you don't. I don't know, I just… where are you looking that it says you have darkvision?
Jrain: If I look in my actions… it tells me to… it's like, "Your actions in combat…"
DM: Your beast has darkvision.
Jrain: Okay, thank you.
DM: So, as Ekko swings a claw up at this annoying little beast, it just… you kill it.
Ekko: Okay. Alright, I will then move and engage the bear—the wolf.
DM: Okay.
Ekko: And… I will do my bite attack to the wolf. Some bear-on-wolf action. And that is what… dope, that's a 12.
DM: Dope. Okay, that misses.
Ekko: Okay. And… that's my turn. Oh wait, can I bonus action do anything? What can I do with the bonus action?
DM: I don't think polar bears have much with bonus action.
Eolo: Oh, polar bear Ekko.
DM: Jrain, you're up.
Ekko: I… I… I bonus action scratched my ass.
DM: Okay, Jrain, you're up.
Jrain: Well… vaguely remembering that I was in the middle of a bunch of enemies and now I can't see anything, I… fall to the ground in the sort of vague direction of where the Zimka woman was, to sort of get out of the way, if at all possible.
DM: Okay. Is… oh, is anybody doing anything about the Zimka woman who's currently bleeding to death on the ground?
Eolo: Oh.
Finnan: I… I… I can. I can't—since it's my turn.
DM: Okay. One of the shades disappears. Tim, make a—hold on, where did I… make a Strength saving throw.
Finnan: 19!
DM: Ow!
Finnan: The best I can roll.
unknown_speaker{DM}: This shade appears right next to you—wait, it appears, like, amongst the four of you.
DM: And it's like the wind just shivers as it appears, and you feel like you're pushed backwards, but you resist. You don't get… you don't get pushed.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And then it attacks you.
unknown_speaker{DM}: What's your AC?
Finnan: 15.
unknown_speaker{DM}: It misses.
DM: The second shade… the second shade attacks… actually, it… you know what? It appears on top of Finnan as well. Make another Strength saving throw.
Finnan: 14.
DM: You resist a second time!
Eolo: Nice.
unknown_speaker{DM}: As these things are trying to push you off the side.
DM: But they don't succeed.
Jrain: Because there's four of them.
DM: Well, how does *Mirror Image* work?
Finnan: Did one hit me?
DM: Yeah, one just critted.
Finnan: It hits a mirror instead.
DM: Okay. Whatever your—
Finnan: One of the four Finnans vanishes in a puff of light, and… well, you can't actually see… nobody can see what happens.
DM: Correct. Yes.
Eolo: Hmm.
DM: The wolf then…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …walks in—
DM: …swings at Justas. You said you have a 19 AC?
DM: It just hits you. Just barely.
unknown_speaker{DM}: You get knocked to the ground. You take…
DM: 11 points of piercing damage and 2 points of cold damage.
Justas: Awesome.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And then, as you're on the ground, it leaps at your jaw—it goes for your throat.
DM: Tearing into it. And you take another…
unknown_speaker{DM}: 6 points of slashing damage, and again, it leaves a tooth. There's a jagged tooth in your neck.
DM: And now it is the Zimka woman's turn.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Doesn't look super healthy… let's see how she does. Well, she doesn't fail, she…
DM: …does not fail her death saving throw.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Finnan, you're up.
Finnan: Oh, okay. Do I have any idea how many shades are around? I think it's two, right?
unknown_speaker{DM}: You know there's two of them appeared, but it's hard to actually see them.
Finnan: And they can obviously see in the dark.
DM: They can see in the dark, yes.
Finnan: Too many things to do. Okay, I will… bonus action, shout a magic word of healing—just, like, a faint sort of resonant…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …song.
Finnan: …at the Zimka woman.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Okay.
Finnan: Casting *Healing Word*.
DM: Yep.
Finnan: So… that heals her 10.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Yep.
Finnan: And then I am going to… use *Vicious Mockery* on one of the shades next to me.
Eolo: Yes, yes.
Finnan: Wisdom saving throw?
Eolo: So I will curse…
Finnan: …the spirits of the wild wind. DC 15 Wisdom save?
DM: I made it.
Finnan: And then… I've got my—
unknown_speaker{DM}: Justas, you're next, while Tim decides what he does.
Finnan: I'm thinking about whether I want to run.
DM: Well, Justas—Schwartz—go ahead and go while Tim thinks about what he does. You'll have a while before the enemies would have a chance.
Justas: First I'll make two attacks on the wolf, with my axe and with the… 13? 13's a miss.
DM: You take 2 points of damage—or 3 points of damage—and you feel the icy tooth in your neck melt away.
Justas: Awesome. I'm sorry.
Finnan: I can't actually move my character, Mike, because I'm… in a fog of war.
DM: Bah.
Eolo: But I… I don't want… I don't like being this close to the edge. I'm gonna run…
DM: Now you should be able to move it. Schwartz, the AC is 15, just tell me if you hit.
Justas: That's a natural 20 on one of them, and a miss on the other.
DM: Okay.
Justas: So, that is 9 points damage—
DM: 9 total?
Justas: 9 total, yep. That wolf—underwolf.
DM: It's badly hurt, but it's not dead. Eolo, you're up.
Justas: Hold up, I'll use… I'll do—bonus action, I'll cast *Light*.
Eolo: Mmm. Right?
Finnan: It's not a bonus action.
DM: That's not a… that's not a bonus action.
Justas: It's not a cantrip?
DM: You can't cast anything—it's a cantrip, but it's an action.
Eolo: Hmm.
Justas: Cantrips can't be—
DM: You can't cast—unless it says "bonus action" on the casting time, you can't cast it as a bonus action.
Justas: Got it.
DM: If you could cast your spell as a bonus action, you could cast your cantrip in the same turn, but… okay. Eolo, you're up.
Eolo: So there's a Chasm Wisp right behind me, right?
DM: It's like a little ice creature the size of… or a little glowing shard the size of a robin. Ekko killed one with one blow.
Eolo: I will pop a crossbow bolt in it. Okay. 25 to hit.
DM: That hits.
Eolo: That's the one right next to me.
DM: Yep, how much—
Eolo: Oh, I rolled… I wrote—oops, 9. And then…
unknown_speaker{Finnan}: Plus the d4?
DM: Kills it.
Eolo: …with the plus the d4, okay. And… continuing his graceful spin, Eolo—should I just take out the other one, or should I hit the wolf? I'll hit the wolf two more times. 15 to hit.
DM: That hits.
Eolo: And then I'll use… let's see, so I roll… that's 8, and then I roll my d4… that's another 2… and then I'll use that… what was it called? The Psionic Strike, to do another—
DM: To do that again, okay? So tell me how—
Eolo: 11…
DM: 11…
Finnan: 21 total.
DM: Eolo… kills the second wolf, with another psionic strike to the head.
unknown_speaker{DM}: But you also take 4 points of damage from its tooth that's still embedded in your neck.
Eolo: Don't let that get to your head?
Ekko: Your head.
Eolo: Ugh. What, you mean my endless success?
unknown_speaker{Ekko}: Yeah, don't let your endless success get—keep—get…
Eolo: …to their head.
DM: Having killed both of the wolves…
unknown_speaker{DM}: This little… this little creature comes over and… bursts a burst of… like, needling ice…
DM: …towards Eolo.
DM: But… it just goes… all around you, but somehow none of the little ice shards hit you.
unknown_speaker{DM}: The second one…
DM: …comes by Finnan and does the same thing…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …much more effectively.
DM: As the ice shards go flying right towards—
Finnan: My illusory duplicate.
DM: —an illusory duplicate, so you have one left.
Finnan: Now you can see a second one… I've got one left.
DM: Okay, Ekko, you're up.
Finnan: I'm gonna just yell, "Little help!"
unknown_speaker{Jrain}: Oh, girl.
Ekko: Sorry, I'm dealing with it. Sorry, just hold on for one second.
DM: There's a guy.
Ekko: Actually, can you just roll attacks for me? For just polar bear attack—bite and claw?
DM: You can't really… all you can see to hit is the Chasm Wisp.
Ekko: All I can see to hit is what?
Finnan: The little… the little—
DM: I guess this… that shade you can see—no, you can see one of the shades. Actually, you can see that shade. Somebody can just roll Ekko's attacks against that shade.
Finnan: The 16 and a 19 without modifiers, so I assume—
DM: Those both hit, yeah, yeah.
Eolo: Nice.
Ekko: Alright, sorry about that, y'all.
DM: That's okay.
Finnan: No worries.
Ekko: One thing—alright, so what… what just happened? Did I… did I… what am I attacking?
Finnan: Both your attacks hit the shade, but I haven't rolled damage yet.
Ekko: Perfect. So it's 2d6 plus 5, and 1d8 plus… where's the other one?
DM: Just tell me what the total damage is.
Ekko: Okay. Here, let me… let me roll it right now. Okay, so… I wanna roll… oh, I can roll multiple dice at the same time, right? So 1d8, and then 2d6, and this is plus 11. 21 damage total. Or 20 damage total—sorry, 20 damage total.
DM: You… you slam into this—oh, but wait, hold on, there's this—
Finnan: This one here, I assume.
DM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't seem to hurt it as badly as you wished you had.
Finnan: But you can… you can do—no, Moon Druids at level 6 don't do… yeah, you could do radiant… legendary force damage with their attacks, or radiant.
DM: Nevermind! Your claws glow with the strength of your inner… of the strength of the chasm's magic, and it tears through it, even though it seems resistant to regular claws. Yeah, Kate, Jrain can see again.
Jrain: Oh, wonderful! Love how that works. Well then… I…
Jrain: I guess I'm just gonna… is it even possible to shoot at a Chasm Wisp from close range?
DM: Sure! You have Sharpshooter, right?
Jrain: Yeah, true.
DM: So, you can shoot in melee.
Jrain: Fine. I do.
Jrain: I, however, roll a 12.
DM: A 12 will miss.
Jrain: But you can take a second attack. I will try again.
unknown_speaker{DM}: If at first you don't succeed…
Jrain: 16.
DM: That also misses. Okay, the shades are really… each… the shades, one of them… swings… this one swings at Finian. What's your AC again—is it 14 or 13?
Finnan: 13.
DM: It hit a… it rolled a 14.
Finnan: I'm gonna Cutting Words that again.
DM: Okay.
Finnan: It misses… well, yeah, it definitely misses.
DM: And then the second shade… the second shade…
Finnan: Evil.
DM: …appears…
DM: …and you're— it appears right on top of you, again, shuddering with air. Make a Strength saving throw.
DM: Finnan is tottering on the edge. The shade blows Finian towards the edge, and you're basically balanced on the edge. Any, like—you’re sort of inches from the edge; any push would knock you over. But the shades do not still have an attack. And it's your turn.
Finnan: I can't see anything.
DM: No, correct. You're standing in the dark, on a precipice in the dark. You feel like if you move, you might fall.
Finnan: I'm… I am going to use my action to cast *Light*.
DM: Okay.
Eolo: Hmm.
DM: Now you can see! Let's reveal the world.
Finnan: So, none of them can… okay, I'm gonna run. 1, 2…
unknown_speaker{DM}: 3…
Finnan: 4… 5… 6. One of those two shades was wounded, right?
DM: Badly wounded, yeah.
Finnan: I will—
DM: …away.
Finnan: Again, try to…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …curse it.
Finnan: Oh, sorry, I cast *Light*.
DM: Light, yeah.
Finnan: I will bonus action give Justas an Inspiration.
DM: Justas, you're up!
Justas: Hmm, mmm, mmm.
DM: You're gonna go axe one of the shades?
Justas: Am I in melee with the Chasm Wisp? Do I need to take that out first?
unknown_speaker{DM}: You are; it's, like, buzzing around your head.
DM: It's like the size of a robin.
Finnan: Yeah. Ignore it.
Justas: Chop that guy first.
Finnan: The shade.
Justas: I'm gonna ignore it. I'm gonna do what Finn says and go…
unknown_speaker{DM}: …chop up the shades.
Eolo: Here we go.
DM: It does shoot its little icicle things at you.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Oh, it actually hits you. This… this gust of needles comes flying at you. You take…
Finnan: Ekko is a giant polar bear, so you have to be one below, but you can still kill the wounded shade.
unknown_speaker{DM}: You take 3 points of damage as you run away from the robin. The top one is the wounded one.
Justas: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… let me just come around, like, to the side.
DM: Yeah. You can also move your Spiritual Weapon too, and put it anywhere you want.
Justas: Yeah, it's just gonna follow… next to me.
DM: Okay.
Justas: Yeah. I'll attack the wounded one first.
DM: Okay.
Justas: That is another natural 20!
DM: That kills it, as far as hit points.
Justas: And then Spiritual Weapon on the other one. That is another natural—
DM: Okay, so…
Eolo: Outrageous.
Finnan: That Inspiration is really doing a lot of work here.
Justas: Wow. Holy shit.
DM: 18 damage.
Justas: 18.
DM: It's badly hurt; that's more than half its health. Oh, wait, is this a normal weapon attack?
Finnan: Spiritual Weapon, it's—
DM: Oh, it's Spiritual Weapon. It's not a normal weapon attack. Eolo, you're up! There's not much left.
Eolo: I will… fire at the shade.
DM: Okay.
DM: Did you just crit?
Eolo: Yes. That's a 29 to hit. Okay. And a crit, yeah.
DM: That hits.
unknown_speaker{DM}: Sorry.
Eolo: Roll once for damage—that's 8—and then I roll again.
DM: Yep.
Eolo: Is that correct? Yep. That's another 6, so…
Eolo: 14, and then a little 2d4.
Finnan: You only add the d6, not the plus 4.
DM: But then you roll 2d4 fire damage.
Finnan: Yeah.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And it has currently 2 hit points. Oh, oops, I just damaged…
DM: I think I just damaged Eolo instead of… oh, no, I didn't. I didn't, I didn't. It only has 2 hit points left, so your 2d4 fire damage definitely kills it.
Eolo: Bam. And then…
DM: Eolo continues to clear the field, twirling and shooting his… after that first mistake, you've really got your footing.
Eolo: Totally. And then I have 2 more attacks remaining, right, so I can take out both Chasm Wisps, hopefully.
DM: Was that your first attack, yeah?
Eolo: Yup.
DM: Yeah?
Eolo: Second one is a 15 to hit on the one close to me.
DM: They dart around; they're fast, they have high AC. You miss it.
Eolo: And… with my third attack… I've had—
DM: That hits.
Eolo: 4… 9.
DM: 9. Which one are you shooting at? The close one?
Eolo: The one… the close one.
DM: It is dead. The last Wisp… it doesn't seem to be concerned that everybody else is gone, and it just… tries to… shoot a needle gust at whoever's nearest, which in this case is Justas.
unknown_speaker{DM}: But it goes wide.
DM: And Ekko didn't kill—I mean… somebody just killed it, the last thing.
Jrain: Yeah. Ekko kills the last thing.
Finnan: Ekko kills it. End it.
DM: Ekko kills the last thing.
unknown_speaker{DM}: And…
Eolo: Hmm.
unknown_speaker{DM}: The triumphant music plays in Elo's head, in Eolo's head.
DM: …something soundtrack in the background there.
unknown_speaker{DM}: As everything, it seems…
DM: The danger seems to be gone.
DM: As you all…
Jrain: Arrows from where the wolf body disintegrated.
DM: Yeah, how many arrows did you… you can recover, like—
Finnan: Used four.
DM: You can recover… actually, you can recover all of them. It's pretty easy to recover them.
