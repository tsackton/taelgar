Eolo: Eolo gonna start strolling towards one of the wolves with the aim of kind of kicking at it with a foot a little bit, and leaning down to investigate.
DM: Roll initiative.
Ekko: No, that's… that's the fight, you know.
Finnan: Eolo!
Ekko: I don't even know who anybody is, like… do we trust…
DM: I don't know!
Ekko: The only one… the only one I… the only one I know here is Eolo, and I definitely don't trust him, so I'm…
DM: Let me…
Ekko: …this whole situation.
Finnan: Is it… wait, is it a… is it within 20 feet of the woman?
DM: Is the wolf now?
Finnan: Okay.
DM: Ekko is what?
DM: Here's the map. Wait, so you guys… let me just… you should be… here, let me change the music, and… you should be able to go to this map. Go to this link.
Finnan: I see it.
Ekko: Aw, man, I feel like we need to roleplay for one more second here, because we don't know anybody, so now it's like… like, I don't even know who to fight.
Finnan: No, no, it's good. It's great to have a combat when you don't know anybody. I know… I know a few people here.
DM: So you should s—
Ekko: Cool.
DM: You should be able to see on this map the Zimkan woman and the two frozen wolves.
Eolo: Yep.
DM: And you should… oh, let me actually expand the Fog of War, because you have your light spell now. So you can kind of see all the way into the darkness.
Eolo: Nice.
DM: Yeah, I drew it. Well, I used stamps, but… I was proud of myself. So, you can't quite see, like, kinda where these bridges go. Okay.
Ekko: Are we really gonna?
DM: Yeah, roll initiative.
Ekko: Limits.
DM: When Eolo started moving towards the wolves, they started moving.
Ekko: 16.
Finnan: I…
Eolo: 20… 23.
DM: Oh, it actually took all your rolls. Did you all just roll in D&D Beyond?
Jrain: 16.
Justas: 23, 9, 15, 4?
DM: Okay. Let's see, I hope this doesn't… so…what happens if I hit Start Combat? Ack! Now. Can you guys see all the things in the list now? Did it just show all the things that are gonna show up?
Finnan: There is a list of things, yes.
DM: Oops. Yeah, I was supposed to see…
Finnan: …that. You have to hide… well, does this not have a GM layer?
DM: You can't see the creatures, but I don't know how to take them off of… oh, wait, hide, there we go.
Finnan: Yeah.
DM: They might not show up. They might be friends. We haven't met. They might be friends.
Finnan: Back.
DM: Yeah. They might be friends. Now you cannot see them, right? Oh.
Finnan: Well… we don't really know each other, so… but Jrain has Alert, so theoretically, if you wanted to swap with somebody, you could.
DM: Okay, I just gotta bring up Tim's combat mix.
Eolo: Hmm.
DM: So… Eolo gets the jump, so you see, as you start walking to the wolf, it… it… it starts moving, like it's starting to, like, gather its body, like it's gonna pounce on you. But you're way faster than it, and you get the jump on it before it can successfully pounce.
Eolo: Oh, so it… it wasn't… made of ice, it was just covered with ice, and is intact?
DM: No, it's moving, it's made of ice, it's just attacking you.
Eolo: Nope.
DM: It's encased in ice, the ice doesn't break. It's just starting to move.
DM: Like, it… it's… it's… it's…
Eolo: Oh, I think I missed something you said.
DM: I just said it's gathering its body to pounce.
Eolo: Well, I will make several crossbow attacks then. Let's see… how many attacks do I get?
DM: You can make three crossbow attacks if you use your bonus action.
Eolo: How about I'll… can I…
Ekko: Are you saying…
Eolo: I can do my…
Ekko: Are you shooting at anybody else?
Eolo: Just…
Ekko: We don't know what the fuck anybody is. Dude, like, you and I don't know who the fuck anybody else is. Like, this is why this is all confusing and shit.
Eolo: I'll start by trying to do a telekinetic shove to push it off the platform.
DM: So that used your bonus action, or your action?
Eolo: It's a magic action, it says.
DM: So that would… that would be instead of an… you could do that, but it would be instead of an attack. Oh, it says, Elizabeth—
Eolo: Bonus action, you can telekinetically shove one creature within 30 feet of yourself.
DM: Then you can do it as a bonus.
Eolo: The Strength saving throw DC 14.
DM: Okay. Okay. Yep.
Eolo: Oh, and it only moves it 5 feet. Huh. Well…
DM: It… it… it doesn't… it just… your telekinetic fist just sort of shoves against it.
Eolo: Hmm.
DM: And it just doesn't… it just stands there, like… like, it doesn't… it doesn't seem to be bothered by it.
Eolo: Okay, so I fire my crossbow—my left crossbow. Oh. Okay. Bye. Fire wildly into the air.
DM: Ten misses, quite… oh, and what kind of arrows do you have, Eric?
Eolo: Oh. Right.
DM: What are your arrows? You… you see, everybody else sees as Eolo goes to pull an arrow out of his quiver, there are no arrows in his quiver. They just… it just appears as he pulls it out.
Justas: Awesome.
Eolo: I've been playing.
DM: Just make them fire arrows? Yeah, sure, yes. I mean, that would be an obvious thing to have made already, fire. It's fine for them to be fire.
Eolo: Yeah, yeah.
DM: I mean, you can't change… it takes a short rest to change what they are, but you can declare right now that they're fire arrows. Because Eolo would have arrows. It's winter! What else do you bring with you in winter? You bring fire arrows.
Eolo: Mmm… so that's… but… 
DM: That misses.
Eolo: But you get…
DM: I'm like…
Eolo: I rolled a 2 that time.
DM: And that weapon also misses.
Eolo: So, two glowing streaks zoom away, well clear of the wolf.
DM: So the wolf leaps forward towards this creature who was attacking it. And… as it moves, the ice is, like, cracking…but it's like, you can see there's almost a wolf body inside, but it's encased in ice, and moving—like, the ice is moving with it. And it leaps towards you, you're not very far away, but it leaps towards you, and tries to attack you.
Eolo: Oh, boy.
DM: Tearing at you with its… with its teeth!
DM: And your AC is… 16!
Eolo: 15.
DM: So it… it hits you. As it leaps towards you, its teeth tear into you. You take 7 points of piercing damage and 2 points of cold damage. And it knocks you down. And as you're lying on your back, because it knocked you down, it's standing over you, and it just tears into your throat a second time.
DM: I like to just rip out… your throat. Oh, and it gets a tooth solidly into your throat.
Eolo: Oh, boy.
DM: You take another 7 points of damage. And as its jaw comes away from your throat, like, dripping with blood, you feel, like, an icy shard embedded in your neck, like, pulsing with cold.
DM: Ekko, you're up.
Ekko: Is Wild Shaping an action, or a bonus?
Finnan: Bonus action.
DM: Bonus action. So you can Wild Shape, and then still move, and then still attack.
Ekko: I get two attacks as a polar bear, right?
DM: Do you? Do you get an extra attack as a…
Ekko: As the bear makes two attacks.
DM: Oh, yeah, yeah, then absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're looking at the polar bear stat. Yeah, of course, you get two attacks as a bear.
Ekko: Alright, cool. Ekko is, like, looks at Eolo like, "What the fuck, you dumbass?" And then it's like… and then, and basically, like…
Eolo: Somebody had to do something.
Ekko: He, like, rolls forward, like, tucks his wings in and rolls forward like a ball, and then kind of rolls, and then rolls up into, like, probably tripling in size into a… how many… how big is this polar bear? Don't say it on the thing.
Finnan: It's large, so it's, like… four squares.
DM: I don't know… I don't know if I can make this… I don't know if I can make the polar bear controlled by you.
Ekko: That's fine.
DM: I don't think I can. But you're large.
Ekko: Yeah, rolls forward, quadrupling in size into this, like, large polar bear, and flips up and just, like, roars mightily, and then swoops in to go to attack. First I'll do… oh, so they're both plus… oh, plus 8. Or plus 7 to hit. Yep. How do you do that? Just roll…
DM: Just roll a D20 and add 7.
Finnan: Yeah.
Ekko: D20… and I roll.
DM: So… Jrain is next.
Ekko: Wait, 18.
DM: 18—that hits. Your first claw just impacts, cracking along the ice.
Ekko: Okay, great, and that does D8 plus 5. Hold on one second… where's the 8?
Ekko: 6 damage, and then second attack, claw attack.
DM: As you hit it these shards of ice come flying off its body.
DM: Towards you. Make a Dex save.
Ekko: It's… and I missed, badly, the last one.
DM: You take… you take 3 points of damage from flying ice.
Ekko: And then, make a Dex save.
Finnan: Polar bears are resistant to cold damage, by the way.
DM: Okay, you take… you take 1 point of damage… oh, no, you take…
Ekko: Yeah.
DM: You take 1 point of damage from flying ice.
Ekko: Okay, got it. My… my second—
DM: You moved up to, like, here, right? And you missed—you rolled a 1 on your second attack?
Finnan: Also, you get 18 temp HP when you shift, so add that to your character. Perfect. So you should have 17 temp HP now.
DM: Jrain, you're up.
Jrain: I cast a …intense baleful glance at my opponent in this battle, which is a Hunter's Mark
DM: I just mark—
Jrain: Hunter's Mark, thank you. Okay. And then I shoot at the thing.
Jrain: …thing with an arrow.
DM: Okay. But you're… but you're all—
Jrain: I am trying, but my computer is being slow, and so the clicking is not happening very fast.
DM: And I think you get two attacks as well, right?
Jrain: Yes. Yep. That's a 25.
DM: That hits.
Jrain: 11 points of piercing damage. Plus D6… okay.
Finnan: For Hunter's Mark. Thank you.
Jrain: …more. Alright. And… did… did that, like… hit into it and lodge in a place that I can still see it?
DM: The arrow? Yeah, it's… like, it smashed through the ice and seems to have hurt it. I mean, it definitely hurt it. The arrow probably is stuck in the ice right now.
Jrain: Great. Counting them, you know.
DM: Yeah, yeah?
Jrain: Alright, so I shoot again, emboldened by my first success.
DM: That hits, that definitely hits.
Jrain: So that was a 10, and then the extra dice is a… 5.
DM: Okay, so 10… so 15 total?
Finnan: And it… its speed is reduced by 10 feet from Slow.
DM: Right. As you hit it… as that hits it a second time…
