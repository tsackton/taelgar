--- Into the Chasm ---
[00:00:00.00 - 00:00:05.04] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, isn't… Should we also acknowledge this momentous occasion?
[00:00:05.04 - 00:00:06.09] Tim Sackton (Finnan): That's awesome, I love it.
[00:00:06.09 - 00:00:09.24] Mike Sackton (DM): Tim as a player. I know.
[00:00:09.83 - 00:00:14.19] David Kong (Ekko): like, no, this has been, like, what, our lifetimes in the making? Tim as a player, intact.
[00:00:14.19 - 00:00:16.12] Mike Sackton (DM): It's true.
[00:00:16.12 - 00:00:24.29] David Kong (Ekko): Turning over the reins to his brother, his beloved brother, now, as the DM. This is pretty fucking epic, I'm just saying. Great.
[00:00:24.48 - 00:00:28.75] Mike Sackton (DM): Tim's kind of a high, high, a difficult act to follow.
[00:00:29.30 - 00:00:30.08] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah, it's true.
[00:00:30.08 - 00:00:32.08] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm sure it will be amazing.
[00:00:33.86 - 00:00:35.62] David Kong (Ekko): I'm stoked, though, Mike. This is…
[00:00:36.11 - 00:00:36.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Fast.
[00:00:36.66 - 00:00:38.62] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, shout out to Tim, this is great.
[00:00:38.62 - 00:01:04.68] Mike Sackton (DM): So… forget everything we said last session. I mean, obviously all the world building and character building, fine, but I have a… I have a new intro to start over with, and then… and if we're feeling complicated, I might break us into two breakout rooms to do two different things. Just to get every… because you're in two separate spots. Right, because…
[00:01:04.68 - 00:01:06.99] David Kong (Ekko): Breakout rooms. I like those.
[00:01:06.99 - 00:01:10.22] Tim Sackton (Finnan): We did that at the beginning of the Dunmark campaign.
[00:01:10.50 - 00:01:10.90] unknown_speaker: that way.
[00:01:11.55 - 00:01:15.11] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Every now. Yeah. Like, the very f- the very first adventure.
[00:01:15.11 - 00:01:15.52] Mike Sackton (DM): session.
[00:01:15.52 - 00:01:15.97] Tim Sackton (Finnan): breakout.
[00:01:15.97 - 00:01:16.56] unknown_speaker: Yeah.
[00:01:16.56 - 00:01:19.88] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Session, a breakout room with each one of you for the intros.
[00:01:20.67 - 00:01:25.54] unknown_speaker: South. Let me just turn on… sorry, the…
[00:01:27.40 - 00:01:28.07] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Good.
[00:01:29.73 - 00:02:31.02] Mike Sackton (DM): For as long as anybody remembers, the Great Chasm has split Simcova like a wound, an impossible cleft that plunges into endless depths, from which strangeness typically emerges. Spires of impossible buildings, unexpected lights, storms and winds that seem to defy gravity, and unusual and unseasonable plants that the Kenku sometimes harvest. Although many in the region see it as the home of Zephya, the cruel west wind of Zimcovan legends, not all do. The Kenku monks of the Kameko Monastery see it as a place of safety and refuge, where they can train unwatched by the outside world, and safe from danger. And the mystics of the Vehovacai believe the chasm is a place of elemental balance and great power. The summer of 1729 in Zimkova started fine and fair, but by late August. Rumors of an orcish horde led by a fearsome orc calling herself the Ravenger of Winter.
[00:02:31.02 - 00:02:33.29] unknown_speaker: had started to spread across Breva.
[00:02:34.81 - 00:02:48.75] Mike Sackton (DM): In early September, the news came. A great battle had been fought north of the chasm between the dwarves of Nizdihar, apparently aided by a large contingent of Stoneborne and the orcish horde. The Ravager was killed, and the bulk of the orcs were defeated.
[00:02:48.75 - 00:02:54.78] unknown_speaker: But scattered bands fled south to Breva like angry wasps, and the Mezai, the Woodswalkers.
[00:02:55.36 - 00:02:59.82] Mike Sackton (DM): And many others were kept busy defending the people from these scattered orc hordes.
[00:03:00.63 - 00:03:35.50] unknown_speaker: So few noticed as the first signs came of the chasm changing. A summer thunderstorm, thick and warm, burst forth from the chasm in October. But this had happened before, and although it wasn't common, no one really remarked on it. A sandstorm, thick and dry, with scorching heat, came out of the chasm in November. A boulder of volcanic stone, a flame with green fire, tumbled down the river that flows out of the chasm and floated all the way to the green sea, unquenched by water. That was remarked on as mighty strange.
[00:03:38.14 - 00:04:36.53] Mike Sackton (DM): In December, a rainbow appeared. That stretched across the sky over the chasm, and a day later, it shattered into hundreds of thousands of glass shards that drifted to the ground across the chasm and fell in. That was widely seen as an omen, but few could say what it meant. When the rainbow sign was followed by a living sheet of ice that swam out of the chasm and left behind… and swam down the teft, the main river, like a predator, leaving behind dead fish and… frozen banks in its wake, many in Breva began to believe Xyphia was angry, and the chasm needed to be appeased. And then, at the start of January, the sky above the chasm turned black, and held darkness, blotting out the sun over the chasm, like a huge dark cloud on the horizon. For 5 days and nights. And so, on January 8th.
[00:04:36.73 - 00:04:38.54] unknown_speaker: of 1730.
[00:04:38.54 - 00:04:43.20] Mike Sackton (DM): Two weeks before Quintarim, the Sambaran feast day of the Wanderer.
[00:04:43.24 - 00:04:52.08] unknown_speaker: The Veho Vacai gathered some of their wisest mystics and sent them, with a few of the warriors of the Comeca, to investigate They…
[00:04:52.21 - 00:04:53.68] Mike Sackton (DM): What might be going on?
[00:04:54.34 - 00:04:56.04] unknown_speaker: It's now January…
[00:04:56.10 - 00:05:00.84] Mike Sackton (DM): 22nd. More than two weeks have passed, and none have returned.
[00:05:04.17 - 00:05:24.83] Mike Sackton (DM): So, I'm gonna break out Tim and… let's see… create two… three breakout rooms. So, Dave and Eric are in one… Wait. Tim, where are you? I can't add you to a breakout room.
[00:05:28.84 - 00:05:30.02] Mike Sackton (DM): Are you also a host?
[00:05:31.01 - 00:05:31.62] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Maybe he can…
[00:05:31.62 - 00:05:34.24] Mike Sackton (DM): Can you add yourself to room 2?
[00:05:36.01 - 00:05:37.05] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[00:05:38.31 - 00:05:40.24] David Kong (Ekko): Sorry, we join the rooms, and what happens?
[00:05:40.77 - 00:05:48.97] Mike Sackton (DM): So, I'm kicking off each group of you separately, so just join the breakout room, and then we'll rejoin. I'll join, I'll sequentially go through each room.
[00:23:08.47 - 00:23:17.16] Mike Sackton (DM): Wait, did… Eric and Kong don't seem to have closed. Why is nobody here? But…
[00:23:20.67 - 00:23:22.99] Tim Sackton (Finnan): No, it's just timing. They, they need to…
[00:23:23.50 - 00:23:24.45] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[00:23:24.45 - 00:23:27.46] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It gives you 60 seconds for the rooms to close if you don't hit the.
[00:23:27.70 - 00:23:32.47] Mike Sackton (DM): Oh, oh, okay, I see. They have 34 seconds to join.
[00:23:32.70 - 00:23:34.90] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Blow Zoom response time, come on, guys.
[00:23:34.90 - 00:23:41.16] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It'll kick them back in 34 seconds, but they're not… they're probably just chatting and didn't notice.
[00:23:41.16 - 00:23:41.82] Mike Sackton (DM): Right.
[00:23:47.91 - 00:24:15.58] Mike Sackton (DM): So everybody just… I'll tell this to them when they come, but as you… oh, here they are. Okay. So, it's all white, you can't see anything. As you fall, You can keep your armor. One thing that you can clutch to your chest, and one thing in each hand. So you have to pick what you're keeping. From your equipment. I mean, you could clutch a backpack to your chest if you have nothing else you want to clutch.
[00:24:17.27 - 00:24:19.61] Tim Sackton (Finnan): We need to open roll party. Mike?
[00:24:19.61 - 00:24:20.00] Mike Sackton (DM): What?
[00:24:20.00 - 00:24:21.69] David Kong (Ekko): Do we need to roll… open roll 20?
[00:24:21.69 - 00:24:39.95] Mike Sackton (DM): I'm gonna run… combat just in D&D Beyond. There's a map in D&D Beyond. I'll send you a link when we get to it. So, as you fall. I mean, I assume, Eric, you are probably clutching your quiver… Yes. …and your two crossbows, right?
[00:24:39.95 - 00:24:44.10] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yes, I was just thinking that that's not really any other option for that, yeah.
[00:24:44.10 - 00:24:52.46] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah. So you end up with no equipment except your quiver and your two crossbows, so you wouldn't… you wouldn't have… you'd have to find the dag… you wouldn't have a dagger.
[00:24:53.54 - 00:24:56.67] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): And should I… what do I do on my character sheet?
[00:24:56.67 - 00:24:59.53] Mike Sackton (DM): you shouldn't… .
[00:24:59.53 - 00:25:02.08] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Do you have any equipment that's not a crossbow, or…
[00:25:02.08 - 00:25:07.57] Mike Sackton (DM): If you have any equipment on your character sheet that's not a crossbow or your armor, delete it.
[00:25:08.44 - 00:25:09.27] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Okay.
[00:25:09.51 - 00:25:11.27] Mike Sackton (DM): Except the quiver, keep the quiver.
[00:25:11.68 - 00:25:13.13] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I deleted my dagger.
[00:25:13.55 - 00:25:17.35] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, I think that was your only piece of equipment that wasn't…
[00:25:17.38 - 00:25:19.33] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): backpack full of stuff. Do I delete that, too?
[00:25:19.33 - 00:25:24.42] Mike Sackton (DM): Delete that. No, you can't… your backpack goes flying off in the storm, because you're clutching your quiver, not your backpack.
[00:25:25.56 - 00:25:27.00] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): How do I do that? Okay.
[00:25:30.96 - 00:25:31.79] Mike Sackton (DM): M…
[00:25:32.30 - 00:25:33.01] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Delete.
[00:25:33.01 - 00:25:46.88] Mike Sackton (DM): And Echo doesn't have any equipment, so there's nothing for you to lose. You just… you just have your, you know, ring your… you have your amulet of the storm, of the… your amulet of your beast form, and whatever armor you're wearing.
[00:25:46.88 - 00:25:48.00] David Kong (Ekko): Amulited. Might not happen.
[00:25:48.10 - 00:25:54.08] Mike Sackton (DM): Amlet of the Moon. There you go. You're Amlet of the Moon. And you probably should have armor. Yeah.
[00:25:54.74 - 00:25:58.14] David Kong (Ekko): Plate, plate mail? No, you can't wear a plate.
[00:25:58.14 - 00:25:59.67] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Something like.
[00:26:00.07 - 00:26:00.56] David Kong (Ekko): leather?
[00:26:00.56 - 00:26:04.39] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You want something like a breastplate, something that doesn't slow you down too much.
[00:26:04.39 - 00:26:08.95] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah. And then…
[00:26:08.95 - 00:26:10.12] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Not a breastplate.
[00:26:10.73 - 00:26:11.98] David Kong (Ekko): Breastplate? Alright.
[00:26:14.25 - 00:26:21.50] Mike Sackton (DM): Schwartz, I assume Justice would keep your axe and your shield and your armor, but you could clutch a third thing. You could keep something else.
[00:26:21.97 - 00:26:23.67] David Schwartz (Justas): Hey! I…
[00:26:23.67 - 00:26:24.35] Mike Sackton (DM): Might not.
[00:26:26.57 - 00:26:30.93] David Schwartz (Justas): I don't know, like, I think it would… I could clutch that backpack.
[00:26:31.38 - 00:26:31.74] Mike Sackton (DM): Good.
[00:26:32.18 - 00:26:32.68] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah.
[00:26:32.68 - 00:26:33.42] Mike Sackton (DM): Good!
[00:26:34.59 - 00:26:36.13] David Schwartz (Justas): I'll clutch it. I'm strong.
[00:26:36.42 - 00:26:44.89] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, you are. But I'm gonna look at what's in your backpack. Some random things from your backpack are gonna vanish. You don't have that much in your backpack.
[00:26:46.14 - 00:26:47.82] David Kong (Ekko): Alright. Traveling late this year.
[00:26:55.48 - 00:27:02.80] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I'll clutch my bow if I can manage to clutch a quiver at the same time as my bow, I will, otherwise I'll just have to deal with ammunition.
[00:27:03.10 - 00:27:21.46] Mike Sackton (DM): You have… you have two hands, so you can have a quiver… you could clutch your… your cloak, you probably need to hold onto, or it's gonna fly off. So you probably want to clutch your cloak, and then you can hold a bow in one hand and a quiver in another, and lose your sword. Or you could… Clutch your bow and your sword and lose your quiver.
[00:27:23.71 - 00:27:24.61] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You don't need a sword.
[00:27:24.61 - 00:27:31.78] Kate Sackton (Jrain): What? What if I clutch my bow and my cloak and hold her hand? I'm very worried about her.
[00:27:33.32 - 00:27:51.89] Mike Sackton (DM): Oh, that's true. If you wanna… if you wanna try and hold her hand, you might not have 3 things. You could lose your… you could lose your quiver, too. You might have to lose your quiver, too. You could, you could, you could keep a couple arrows. Tell you what, you have 10 eras. But you have to keep track of 10… your individual 10 errors.
[00:27:51.89 - 00:27:54.43] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm keeping track of your errands for you, sweetie.
[00:27:55.50 - 00:27:59.06] Kate Sackton (Jrain): The scholastic one in the party.
[00:27:59.06 - 00:27:59.77] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah.
[00:27:59.92 - 00:28:14.46] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Well, no. Well, last night, when we were working on our character, I was helping Kate add equipment, and I was like, we should add arrows, and Kate rolled her eyes and said, I'm not gonna have to keep track of ammunition, am I?
[00:28:15.37 - 00:28:16.27] Mike Sackton (DM): Bam.
[00:28:17.65 - 00:28:20.06] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And I thought, Mike won't care about that.
[00:28:22.23 - 00:28:32.43] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so I deleted a few things from Justice's backpack that randomly fell out, but you have what's left. You have everything else. And then, Tim, Finian's… What's Finian keeping?
[00:28:35.57 - 00:28:55.04] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm… as I fall, I'm… grabbing my… Little, ocarina, my clay pipe, and my fiddle in one hand, and… Clutching my writing case. And if my cloak… I mean, if my cloak blows off, that's fine. I assume my rings aren't gonna disappear.
[00:28:55.04 - 00:29:03.52] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, your rings, you don't have to do any. Your rings, you keep. But you can keep one thing in one hand, one thing in another hand. You're keeping both of your music.
[00:29:03.52 - 00:29:05.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Middle arena.
[00:29:05.10 - 00:29:05.87] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[00:29:05.87 - 00:29:06.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And…
[00:29:06.88 - 00:29:08.59] Mike Sackton (DM): So, Finney is letting… yeah, okay.
[00:29:08.59 - 00:29:09.60] David Kong (Ekko): So…
[00:29:09.60 - 00:29:15.54] Mike Sackton (DM): No, you have your fiddle, your ocarina, your writing case. Okay. So, I don't mind me.
[00:29:15.54 - 00:29:16.57] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I don't need weapons.
[00:29:17.15 - 00:29:17.67] Mike Sackton (DM): That's true.
[00:29:17.67 - 00:29:19.41] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Instruments are my weapons.
[00:29:20.22 - 00:29:29.11] Mike Sackton (DM): okay. So, you can delete your whole backpack then, Tim.
[00:29:29.11 - 00:29:30.15] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I did already.
[00:29:30.15 - 00:29:36.37] Mike Sackton (DM): There we go. Okay. Say you land.
[00:29:39.29 - 00:29:40.77] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Can you start the music, Mike?
[00:29:41.11 - 00:29:43.65] Mike Sackton (DM): I just did, isn't… I wasn't not playing through the…
[00:29:43.65 - 00:29:45.68] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It's not shared, you have to reshare it.
[00:29:45.89 - 00:29:46.56] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[00:29:47.04 - 00:29:47.81] David Kong (Ekko): Okay.
[00:29:53.49 - 00:29:55.39] Mike Sackton (DM): Advanced…
--- Strangers on the Ice ---
[00:30:05.66 - 00:30:08.78] Mike Sackton (DM): You awaken in the dark, lying on a platform of ice.
[00:30:08.80 - 00:30:11.45] unknown_speaker: Apparently floating in the darkness.
[00:30:12.25 - 00:30:26.91] Mike Sackton (DM): Three body lengths above you is the howling whiteness of snow. You can't see into it, and it looks like it's moving very quickly. It would probably be dangerous to fly in it. And the wind shrieks, even here, lying on the ice beneath it, the wind shrieks.
[00:30:27.01 - 00:30:28.91] unknown_speaker: And.
[00:30:28.91 - 00:30:54.87] Mike Sackton (DM): The occasional gust seems to, like, come and almost steal your breath away. As you open your eyes, first of all, you see everybody here. And then you also see a dim blue light glowing from two places inside this platform of ice, which is enough light to let you see… although you can't really see the edges, it's all just in shadows and darkness, you can see two bridges, one in front of you, one behind you, leading off the platform into darkness.
[00:30:54.87 - 00:30:59.07] unknown_speaker: In front of each bridge, there's a large wolf.
[00:30:59.07 - 00:31:09.60] Mike Sackton (DM): encased almost entirely in ice, like, totally encased in ice. But, like, not in a block of ice, like, thin layer of ice around the wolf's body. Almost looks like a…
[00:31:09.60 - 00:31:11.18] unknown_speaker: Ice.
[00:31:11.23 - 00:31:15.63] Mike Sackton (DM): Sculpture.
[00:31:16.66 - 00:31:17.66] unknown_speaker: Double.
[00:31:18.00 - 00:31:30.67] Mike Sackton (DM): Why doesn't everybody say what their characters look like? If you had a moment to think about it. As you lie here in the darkness. We're staring up into the whiteness of the Halloween wind.
[00:31:33.94 - 00:31:48.54] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'll… I can go first, so… The first thing… I don't know if anybody has darkvision, but assuming nobody has darkvision, the first thing you notice is not What you see, but the sound…
[00:31:48.71 - 00:31:49.57] unknown_speaker: Of.
[00:31:49.86 - 00:32:27.90] Tim Sackton (Finnan): a, like, simple melody being played on a… on a clay pipe. And as the sound is played, suddenly a light begins to glow brightly. And you look up, and I'm casting the light spell, and you see… a halfling, maybe… I don't know, in his mid-40s, early 50s, but, you know, pretty healthy and hail, well-traveled, holding now in his hand a glowing Clay, pipe. That's casting a bright light around all of us. He sets up.
[00:32:27.90 - 00:32:30.81] unknown_speaker: Briefly shaking his head, you can see…
[00:32:30.81 - 00:32:39.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): He's… he has, like, curly… thick, curly brown hair. not…
[00:32:39.16 - 00:32:40.94] unknown_speaker: Not wearing a cloak.
[00:32:41.01 - 00:33:09.70] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Green eyes, a sort of cheerful complexion, The only things that you see, he's wearing, leather armor, studded leather armor, well-traveled, he's… everything about him is he clearly travels a lot. He's holding what seems to be his most precious possession is a leather writing case clutched around his two arms, stuffed with notes and papers and…
[00:33:09.70 - 00:33:12.95] unknown_speaker: Other things that you can't clearly see.
[00:33:14.37 - 00:33:41.42] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And as he sits up, you can see that he's got 3 rings on his fingers, a silver ring, a gold ring, and a… I never decided what this other ring looks like, or Mike never decided what that looks like. And a… and a… sort of a… two silver rings and a gold ring. Any kind of shh… Sits up, shakes his head, and looks around at all of you.
[00:33:47.01 - 00:34:20.41] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Not far away, there's a Russell. as… A raven-like kenku. Flips his body up. from… Lying prone on his back. all in one… Fluid gesture to land on his feet. Two crossbows sweep out. And he does a spin, looking all around. Wild-eyed. Points them up. and then…
[00:34:20.63 - 00:34:22.78] unknown_speaker: Drops them back down to his sides.
[00:34:23.08 - 00:34:36.21] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): What the hell? Iolo is a young Kenku. Wearing leather armor, and strapped to his back is a… Quiver. With glowing runes.
[00:34:38.87 - 00:35:28.30] David Kong (Ekko): as, YOLO, like, pulls out his two crossbows and is, like, looking at everybody, like, you know, about ready to potentially do something or not do something, and slowly is withdrawing. you see this, like, giant Kenku wing, like, like, go in front of the two crossbows, and then… and then, like, kind of slightly covering YOLO's face, and then you see, like, kind of leaning up a second Kenku, also right next to Yolo, sitting up slowly. Wearing, A dark green, cloak. And, and you notice, you know, interesting eyes. He's got, you know, one, one really, like, kind of sapphire, like, emerald, like, really, like, or sorry, emerald, like, green eye, and another one, like, a brown eye. This, like, green-brown eye combo, which is very good.
[00:35:28.30 - 00:35:29.22] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Raw.
[00:35:29.22 - 00:35:58.97] David Kong (Ekko): And… And, but no other, you know, maybe a little bit of armor under the leather coke, but nothing else really, really to speak of. Looks young, not quite as young as YOLO, but, you know, on the younger side, as far as you may be able to surmise with Kenku. And, you know, keeping the wing in front of YOLO, And you see him kind of, like, whispering, like, dude, watch where you're pointing at, watch where you're pointing this. A little, you know, a little aggressive.
[00:35:58.97 - 00:35:59.44] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Okay.
[00:35:59.44 - 00:36:00.08] David Kong (Ekko): It's a little aggressive.
[00:36:01.22 - 00:36:02.40] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Twice, live once, bro.
[00:36:02.40 - 00:36:03.68] David Kong (Ekko): Yep, it's a little aggressive.
[00:36:04.07 - 00:36:04.60] unknown_speaker: You're.

[00:36:13.65 - 00:36:28.80] David Kong (Ekko): And kind of looking around and, you know, seeing, seeing everybody as not looking overly threatening, says, Not sure how we all ended up here, but, I'm, I'm Echo. And, this is YOLO.
[00:36:30.78 - 00:36:31.83] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): low bows.
[00:36:33.37 - 00:36:35.68] David Kong (Ekko): Echo also will give a little, a little breath.
[00:36:40.45 - 00:38:20.21] David Schwartz (Justas): large and powerfully built human in his probably early 50s gets to his feet and nods to all of you, says, justice. He's bald, with a big beard flowing, and this, set of… Armor, you know, head to toe, this long sort of coat of, splint mail, and… greaves and armored all over, with a massive shield that's carved with, these rapids on it. When you look out of the corner of your eye, it seems like the water on it's flowing, and when you look squarely at it, it just looks like a carved shield. He's got, in the other hand, As he drops the backpack that he's been clutching to his chest. In his other hand, carries a massive battle axe, and The closer you look at the loop, this leather loop on the end of it, there's these different… charms, which, if you're familiar with the area, you might recognize Charms for some of the Kestavo, the local spirits, all, you know, in a 100-mile radius from where we are. But this funny collection of things, like a sprig of mistletoe, and an acorn, and a little vial of water, and… others on a necklace around his neck that he's tucking back under his armor again. You know, all these different charms of the local gods, and he… Smiles grimly, and looks around, and… Just gives a little sigh and a shake of his head.
[00:38:25.43 - 00:38:28.70] Kate Sackton (Jrain): With a glance at her, companion.

[00:38:32.85 - 00:39:00.35] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Yeah. Stands up and… Somehow manages to… Twitch her cloak and her hair, which is long and black and flowing. So that all of a sudden, she falls into place, and she's, regained her composure and sorted everything out with her bow and, and arrows. And her, large… Warm-looking gray cloak of, owl feathers.
[00:39:00.35 - 00:39:01.84] unknown_speaker: It goes with her.

[00:39:28.74 - 00:39:30.79] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Drain, J-R-A-I-N.
[00:39:32.98 - 00:40:44.30] Mike Sackton (DM): Lying next to Drain, is a young woman… well… She looks about… maybe 25, 30-ish? She's wearing a well-made fur cloak, although, actually, that… she's not anymore. She was wearing a well-made fur cloak, it snapped off in the wind. And now she's just… she's wearing, sort of. plainly made, like, leathers and fur clothes. They're sort of an unfamiliar style.

[00:43:01.26 - 00:43:09.42] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It's a 20-foot… sphere. So, anybody else who's frightened. Of this situation is also going to be calmed.
[00:43:11.24 - 00:43:20.66] Mike Sackton (DM): You start… as you start to sing, make a… this… this has… well, all your spells have verbal components, make a… make a constitution saving throw.
[00:43:22.58 - 00:43:23.51] David Kong (Ekko): All of us?
[00:43:23.72 - 00:43:25.00] Mike Sackton (DM): No, just Tim.
[00:43:27.08 - 00:43:27.88] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Dean.
[00:43:28.27 - 00:43:51.91] Mike Sackton (DM): As you start to sing, the wind picks up a little bit, and it, like, almost… you, like, it, like, blows across you, and, like, it takes a minute for you to, like, regain the strength of your song. It's almost like the wind is trying to steal your voice. But you recover the strength of your song, and you… you finish, and she comes down, and… and looks around.
[00:43:52.35 - 00:43:52.84] David Kong (Ekko): him, am I?
[00:43:52.84 - 00:43:56.34] Mike Sackton (DM): She seems calmed, like, the spell clearly, clearly worked on.
[00:43:56.34 - 00:44:06.72] Tim Sackton (Finnan): That's only… it only lasts a minute, so I'm gonna quickly… Ask her where we are and why it's… So… Bad.
[00:44:07.46 - 00:44:21.11] David Kong (Ekko): Wait, just before we do any of that, Oh, yeah, yeah. Are we in a place that… because, like, out of everybody here, Echo's probably the only one that's actually, like, actively, like, hung, you know, floating around in the chasm and, like, knows it… like, knows at least the top layers.
[00:44:21.11 - 00:44:21.59] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah.
[00:44:21.59 - 00:44:25.62] David Kong (Ekko): You know? Are we someplace he recognizes, or like, can he place where we are?
[00:44:25.62 - 00:44:35.14] Mike Sackton (DM): No, this… Echo doesn't… it feels… something feels off to you about this, like…
[00:44:35.14 - 00:44:35.69] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Mmm.
[00:44:35.69 - 00:44:42.53] Mike Sackton (DM): the… the… The darkness on both sides, and, like, the unnatural sort of…
[00:44:43.23 - 00:44:48.49] unknown_speaker: storm above you. It doesn't… It doesn't feel…
[00:44:49.46 - 00:45:00.54] Mike Sackton (DM): the way the chasm would normally feel. The chasm normally feels like… sort of… Nature, twisted in an unexpected way, but still kind of natural.
[00:45:00.68 - 00:45:03.25] David Kong (Ekko): Right? This has kind of a…
[00:45:03.80 - 00:45:29.10] Mike Sackton (DM): this sort of, like, it's not normal, like, normally it would be, like, weather, but with gravity going the wrong way, right? Yeah. But it's still weather, it still has this chaos of, like, this is, like, this regular, like, weird… White cloud above you that almost… as you look at it, it's almost, like, beating down on you with, like, a presence, like, that it doesn't want you… that, like, you're not supposed to be here. It definitely does not feel like the place you've been.
[00:45:29.37 - 00:45:31.58] David Kong (Ekko): What, what is it, is it… was it dark out before?
[00:45:32.29 - 00:45:38.41] Mike Sackton (DM): It was, like, 3 o'clock in the afternoon. So, I mean, it was getting dark, because it's midwinter, and you're pretty far north, but…
[00:45:38.41 - 00:45:44.05] David Kong (Ekko): Now, where we are, we're, like, when we look around, we're blocked out, like, the sky's blocked out, like, we can't see anything, we're, like, in the.
[00:45:44.05 - 00:46:00.79] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, so you're, like, lying on a platform that's floating in, like, a black space. So if you look to the left or right, or back or front, it's all blackness, except there's these two glowing lights that are illuminating these two wolves carved out of, like, ice wolves, that then are…
[00:46:00.79 - 00:46:01.25] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[00:46:01.25 - 00:46:10.99] Mike Sackton (DM): positioned like they're guarding two bridges, right? And then above you, there's just this whiteness that's, like, spreading across like a sky, but it's not a real sky, it's a storm.
[00:46:11.15 - 00:46:13.47] Tim Sackton (Finnan): How big is this platform?
[00:46:14.11 - 00:46:18.13] Mike Sackton (DM): you can't… how… what's the radius of white? It's 30 feet in all directions.
[00:46:19.12 - 00:46:20.19] Tim Sackton (Finnan): in all directions.
[00:46:20.19 - 00:46:23.17] Mike Sackton (DM): 40 feet in all directions, and they've been looking at my map.
[00:46:26.50 - 00:47:10.19] Mike Sackton (DM): you can see the… it's just about 40 feet in all directions. You can just… not quite, you can see to your left and right, just the edge… like, the edge of the platform, it just drops off. But to your… to your… same with… it's kind of the ice… where the bridges are, you can't quite… where these two ice bridges are leaving off, it's just a little bit more elongated in those two directions, so you can't quite see… The edge there, but for the most part, you're standing kind of on a… not perfectly spherical, but a roughly shaped 40-foot diameter sphere. Like oval. Like, circle. Yeah, it's not a perfect circle, but it's close-ish to a circle.
--- Ice Wolves Attack ---
[00:47:10.19 - 00:47:19.37] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yolo's gonna start strolling towards one of the wolves with the aim of, Kind of kicking at it with a foot a little bit, and leaning down to investigate.
[00:47:19.37 - 00:47:20.84] Mike Sackton (DM): Raw initiative.
[00:47:21.24 - 00:47:25.54] David Kong (Ekko): No, that's… that's the fight. You know.
[00:47:25.94 - 00:47:27.45] Tim Sackton (Finnan): YOLO!
[00:47:28.54 - 00:47:30.14] David Kong (Ekko): I don't even know who anybody is, like, do we trust.
[00:47:30.94 - 00:47:31.78] Mike Sackton (DM): I don't know!
[00:47:32.12 - 00:47:36.74] David Kong (Ekko): The only one… the only one I… the only one I know here is YOLO, and I definitely don't trust him, so I'm…
[00:47:36.74 - 00:47:37.82] Mike Sackton (DM): Let me.
[00:47:37.82 - 00:47:38.83] David Kong (Ekko): this whole situation.
[00:47:38.83 - 00:47:44.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Is it… wait, is it a… is it within 20 feet of the woman?
[00:47:45.37 - 00:47:46.74] Mike Sackton (DM): Is the wolf now?
[00:47:46.93 - 00:47:47.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay.
[00:47:50.41 - 00:47:51.65] David Kong (Ekko): Echo is what?
[00:47:51.65 - 00:48:05.15] Mike Sackton (DM): Here's the map. Wait, so you guys… let me just… you should be… Here, let me change the music, and… you should be able to go to this map. Go to this link.
[00:48:07.32 - 00:48:08.25] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I see it.
[00:48:08.52 - 00:48:13.77] David Kong (Ekko): Aw, man, I feel like we need to roleplay for one more second here, because we don't know anybody, so now it's like, like, I don't even know who to fight.
[00:48:13.77 - 00:48:22.47] Tim Sackton (Finnan): No, no, it's good. It's great to have a combat when you don't know anybody. I know, I know, I know a few people here.
[00:48:22.47 - 00:48:23.99] Mike Sackton (DM): So you should s-.
[00:48:23.99 - 00:48:24.34] David Kong (Ekko): Cool.

[00:48:29.00 - 00:48:29.59] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yep.
[00:48:30.38 - 00:48:41.68] Mike Sackton (DM): And you should… Oh, let me actually expand the Fog of War, because you have your white spell now. So you can kind of see all the way into the darkness.
[00:48:42.42 - 00:48:43.16] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice.
[00:48:47.94 - 00:49:01.58] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, I drew it. Well, I used stamps, but… I was proud of myself. So, you can't quite see, like, kinda where these bridges go. Okay.
[00:49:08.99 - 00:49:09.89] David Kong (Ekko): Are we really couldn't?
[00:49:10.21 - 00:49:11.72] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, Rally Roll Initiative.

[00:49:44.07 - 00:49:44.94] David Kong (Ekko): Yep.
[00:49:45.62 - 00:49:48.32] unknown_speaker: Oh, it actually took all your roles. Did you all just roll in D&D Beyond?

[00:50:07.02 - 00:50:14.28] unknown_speaker: Okay. Let's see, I hope this doesn't… So…
[00:50:14.28 - 00:50:24.99] Mike Sackton (DM): What happens if I hit start combat? Ack! Now. Can you guys see all the things in the list now? Did it just show all the things that are gonna show up?
[00:50:25.19 - 00:50:27.78] Tim Sackton (Finnan): There is a list of things, yes.
[00:50:27.78 - 00:50:29.03] Mike Sackton (DM): Oops. Yeah, I was supposed to see.
[00:50:29.03 - 00:50:33.02] Tim Sackton (Finnan): that. You have to hide… well, does this not have a GM layer?
[00:50:33.83 - 00:50:38.71] Mike Sackton (DM): You can't see the creatures, but I don't know how to take them off of… oh, wait, hide, there we go.
[00:50:38.71 - 00:50:39.34] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[00:50:39.69 - 00:50:45.18] Mike Sackton (DM): They might not show up. They might be friends. We haven't met. They might be friends.
[00:50:45.18 - 00:50:45.85] Tim Sackton (Finnan): back.
[00:50:46.26 - 00:50:50.83] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah. They might be friends. Now you cannot see them, right? Oh.
[00:50:53.31 - 00:51:03.21] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Well… We don't really know each other, so… But Drain has alerts, so theoretically, if you wanted to swap with somebody, you could.
[00:51:04.14 - 00:51:06.45] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, I just gotta bring up Tim's combat mix.
[00:51:07.26 - 00:51:07.88] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[00:51:15.07 - 00:51:34.47] Mike Sackton (DM): So… Yoho gets the jump, so you see, as you start walking to the wolf, it… it… it… Starts moving, like, it's starting to, like, gather… It's body, like it's gonna pounce on you. But, you're way faster than it, and you get the jump on it before it can successfully pounce.
[00:51:36.10 - 00:51:40.93] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, so it… it wasn't… Made of ice, it was just covered with ice, and his attack.
[00:51:40.93 - 00:51:44.08] Mike Sackton (DM): No, it's moving, it's made of ice, it's just attacking you.
[00:51:45.15 - 00:51:45.74] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nope.
[00:51:46.17 - 00:51:49.69] Mike Sackton (DM): It's encased in ice, the ice doesn't break. It's just…
[00:51:49.86 - 00:51:51.01] unknown_speaker: Starting to move.
[00:51:52.88 - 00:51:57.49] Mike Sackton (DM): Like, it, it's, it's, it's, it… It's…
[00:52:00.61 - 00:52:02.13] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, I think I missed something you said.
[00:52:02.61 - 00:52:04.60] Mike Sackton (DM): I just said it's gathering its body to pounce.
[00:52:05.56 - 00:52:15.41] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Well, I will make several crossbow attacks then. Let's see… How many attacks do I get?
[00:52:15.67 - 00:52:18.71] Mike Sackton (DM): You can make 3 crossbow attacks if you use your bonus action.
[00:52:19.61 - 00:52:21.71] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): How about I'll… can I…
[00:52:21.76 - 00:52:22.33] David Kong (Ekko): Are you saying?
[00:52:22.33 - 00:52:23.46] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I can do my…
[00:52:26.28 - 00:52:27.72] David Kong (Ekko): Are you shooting at anybody else?
[00:52:28.97 - 00:52:29.93] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Just…
[00:52:29.93 - 00:52:35.64] David Kong (Ekko): We don't know what the fuck anybody is. Dude, like, you and I don't know who the fuck anybody else is. Like, this is why this is all confusing and shit.
[00:52:36.55 - 00:52:45.06] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I'll start by trying to do a telekinetic shove. To push it off the platform.
[00:52:45.54 - 00:52:46.86] unknown_speaker: Like.
[00:52:47.70 - 00:52:49.00] Mike Sackton (DM): So that used you…
[00:52:49.00 - 00:52:51.10] unknown_speaker: Your bonus action, or your action?
[00:52:52.18 - 00:52:55.91] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): It's a magic action, it says.
[00:52:55.91 - 00:53:00.93] Mike Sackton (DM): So that would… that would be instead of an… you could do that, but it would be instead of an attack. Oh, it says, Elizabeth.
[00:53:00.93 - 00:53:04.85] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Bonus action, you can telekinetically shove one creature within 30 feet of yourself.
[00:53:05.23 - 00:53:06.45] Mike Sackton (DM): Then you can do it as a person.
[00:53:07.11 - 00:53:09.77] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): The strength saving throw DC14.
[00:53:09.77 - 00:53:10.33] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[00:53:10.73 - 00:53:12.39] unknown_speaker: Okay. Yep.
[00:53:14.37 - 00:53:19.79] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, and it only moves at 5 feet. Huh. Well…
[00:53:19.79 - 00:53:26.17] Mike Sackton (DM): It… it… it doesn't… it just… your… your telekinetic fist just sort of shoves against it.
[00:53:26.17 - 00:53:26.68] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[00:53:26.68 - 00:53:33.01] Mike Sackton (DM): And it just doesn't… It just stands there, like, like, it doesn't… it doesn't seem to be bothered by it.
[00:53:34.06 - 00:53:45.41] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Okay, so I… Fire my crossbow, my left crossbow. Oh. Okay. Bye. Fire wildly into the air.
[00:53:45.41 - 00:53:48.54] Mike Sackton (DM): 10 misses, quite… oh, and what kind of arrows do you have, Eric?
[00:53:50.33 - 00:53:52.95] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh. Right.
[00:53:52.98 - 00:54:03.73] Mike Sackton (DM): What are your arrows? You, you see, everybody else sees as Elo goes to pull an arrow out of his quiver, there are no arrows in his quiver. They just… it just appears as he pulls it out.
[00:54:04.63 - 00:54:05.35] David Schwartz (Justas): Awesome.
[00:54:07.77 - 00:54:08.50] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I've been playing.
[00:54:08.50 - 00:54:14.06] Mike Sackton (DM): just make them fire arrows? Yeah, sure, yes. I mean, that would be an obvious thing to have made.
[00:54:14.06 - 00:54:17.45] unknown_speaker: Already, pre-prior to. It's fine for them to be prior.
[00:54:18.87 - 00:54:19.59] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:20.16 - 00:54:28.50] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean, you can't change… it takes a short rest to change what they are, but you can declare right now that they're fire heirs. Because ELO would have arrows.
[00:54:28.50 - 00:54:35.27] unknown_speaker: It's winter! What else do you bring with you on winter? You bring fire arrows. Maybe a frost worm or something. Exactly.
[00:54:35.27 - 00:54:39.06] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Mmm… So that's… but… so.
[00:54:39.56 - 00:54:40.16] unknown_speaker: But…
[00:54:40.16 - 00:54:41.50] Mike Sackton (DM): A tad messes.
[00:54:41.73 - 00:54:42.78] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): But you get…
[00:54:42.78 - 00:54:43.79] Mike Sackton (DM): I'm a link.
[00:54:47.12 - 00:54:49.63] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I rolled a 2 that time.
[00:54:49.63 - 00:54:51.27] Mike Sackton (DM): And a weapon also misses.
[00:54:51.70 - 00:54:58.48] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So, two glowing streaks. Zoom away, well clear of the wolf.
[00:55:00.06 - 00:55:14.00] Mike Sackton (DM): So the wolf… Leaps forward towards this creature who was attacking it. And… It's, like, as it moves, the ice is, like, cracking.
[00:55:14.00 - 00:55:30.35] unknown_speaker: But it's like, you can see there's almost a wolf body inside, but it's encased in ice, and moving, like, the ice is moving with it. And it weeps towards you, you're not very far away, but it weeps towards you, and tries to attack you.
[00:55:31.39 - 00:55:32.05] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, boy.
[00:55:33.28 - 00:55:38.66] unknown_speaker: Tearing at you with its… With its teeth!

[00:55:42.73 - 00:56:10.64] unknown_speaker: So it… it hits you. It's… it's, As it leaps towards you, its teeth tear into you. You take, 7 points of piercing damage and 2 points of cold damage. And it knocks you down. And as you're lying on the back, as you're lying on your back, because it knocked you down, it's standing over you. And it just tears into your throat a second time.
[00:56:11.77 - 00:56:18.51] Mike Sackton (DM): I like to just rip out. Your throat. Oh, and it gets a tooth, solidly into your throat.
[00:56:19.03 - 00:56:19.54] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, boy.
[00:56:19.54 - 00:56:34.31] Mike Sackton (DM): You take another 7 points of damage. And as its jaw comes away from your throat, like, dripping with blood, you feel, like, an icy shard, like, embedded in your neck, like, pulsing with cold.
[00:56:38.31 - 00:56:40.04] Mike Sackton (DM): Ekka, you're up.
[00:56:40.95 - 00:56:45.23] David Kong (Ekko): Is wild shaping an action, or a bonus.

[00:57:15.80 - 00:57:17.24] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Somebody had to do something.
[00:57:17.41 - 00:57:35.64] David Kong (Ekko): He, like, rolls forward, like, tucks his wings in and rolls forward, like, like, as a ball, and then kind of rolls, and then rolls up into, like, probably tripling in size into a… How many… how big is this polar bear? Don't say it on the thing.

It seems to be something he was targeting at the, the Zimka woman. Did you let it take effect, or did you try and resist it?
[01:05:07.32 - 01:05:08.61] David Kong (Ekko): I tried to resist it.
[01:05:08.78 - 01:05:10.09] Mike Sackton (DM): Make a…
[01:05:10.09 - 01:05:12.47] unknown_speaker: Charisma savings for Tim? No, Wisdom.
[01:05:12.47 - 01:05:13.28] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna save.
[01:05:13.28 - 01:05:13.82] Mike Sackton (DM): That's crazy.
[01:05:15.30 - 01:05:16.24] David Kong (Ekko): Charisma safe?
[01:05:17.48 - 01:05:21.40] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I went with it. I could tell what he was doing, and I know him a little bit, and…
[01:05:21.40 - 01:05:23.08] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, you could have let it happen.
[01:05:23.58 - 01:05:24.82] David Kong (Ekko): 13. I failed anyway.
[01:05:24.82 - 01:05:25.59] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:05:26.35 - 01:05:28.14] David Kong (Ekko): Eric, I was calmed?
[01:05:28.38 - 01:05:35.88] Mike Sackton (DM): It means you're immune to fright, which is useful, because you're about to get a fright effect hitting you. Well, not you, actually, because you're not in the cone.
[01:05:36.31 - 01:05:37.11] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I…
[01:05:38.98 - 01:05:40.44] unknown_speaker: Of course.
[01:05:40.56 - 01:05:50.33] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So, my roles have been 1, 2, and 20. 20, of course, was for my role to resist the buff.
[01:05:51.00 - 01:05:58.34] Mike Sackton (DM): So, you shake off the weird spell, but, but, Drain, Finian, and Justice still need to make a, wisdom save.
[01:05:58.34 - 01:05:59.43] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I rolled a 4.
[01:05:59.71 - 01:06:03.25] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so you take 5 points of psych… you take 5 points of psychic damage.
[01:06:03.77 - 01:06:04.92] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I rolled at 11.
[01:06:05.74 - 01:06:07.39] Mike Sackton (DM): You also take 5 points of psychic damage.
[01:06:07.79 - 01:06:09.78] David Kong (Ekko): I think your roles are in character. This is perfect.
[01:06:10.93 - 01:06:11.58] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna…
[01:06:11.58 - 01:06:12.00] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So far.
[01:06:12.90 - 01:06:13.84] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Schwartz, what'd you got?
[01:06:15.21 - 01:06:17.10] David Schwartz (Justas): What did I get?
[01:06:17.35 - 01:06:17.84] Mike Sackton (DM): Wisdom.
[01:06:17.84 - 01:06:19.03] David Schwartz (Justas): 12.
[01:06:19.46 - 01:06:24.81] Mike Sackton (DM): 12! Wow, you guys are really rolling poorly. That's your roll, that's with your plus, right? You also take 5 points of psychic damage.
[01:06:24.81 - 01:06:35.02] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm giving myself advantage on the, on the… Concentration check. With luck.
[01:06:35.77 - 01:06:36.26] unknown_speaker: Okay.
[01:06:36.26 - 01:06:43.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Which makes… means I succeed. That… however, none of you are scared of the thing.
[01:06:43.66 - 01:06:47.73] unknown_speaker: It seems terrifying, but you just feel very calm.
[01:06:47.90 - 01:06:53.30] Mike Sackton (DM): And it really doesn't bother you that it seems terrifying. Bam.
[01:06:53.36 - 01:06:55.93] unknown_speaker: However, the Zimka woman falls to the ground.
[01:06:59.93 - 01:07:00.71] Mike Sackton (DM): Bhh.
[01:07:01.55 - 01:07:05.52] unknown_speaker: I mean, she also took the psychic damage, but probably doesn't have that many hit points.
[01:07:07.18 - 01:07:10.38] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I mean, she falls to the ground, as in she's unconscious, or…
[01:07:10.38 - 01:07:11.18] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:11.64 - 01:07:12.30] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay.
[01:07:12.77 - 01:07:14.91] unknown_speaker: She's… she's unconscious.
[01:07:16.02 - 01:07:18.47] Mike Sackton (DM): And… The other wolf…
[01:07:18.90 - 01:07:20.62] unknown_speaker: Comes charging.
[01:07:21.48 - 01:07:31.40] Mike Sackton (DM): 1, 2, 3, Justice! It charges towards… You… .
[01:07:34.43 - 01:07:36.23] Mike Sackton (DM): What is your AC?
[01:07:36.23 - 01:07:37.02] David Schwartz (Justas): T.
[01:07:37.73 - 01:07:40.38] David Kong (Ekko): You have a 19AC? That's pretty sweet.
[01:07:40.64 - 01:07:55.90] Mike Sackton (DM): It just… it comes up towards you, and it just… it… it… just… its claws, or its bite, you just… you just casually push it aside with your shield. Like, what, are you gonna bite me through the shield? No, you're not. I shake my head.
[01:07:55.90 - 01:07:57.28] David Schwartz (Justas): a bit disappointed.
[01:07:58.02 - 01:07:59.22] Mike Sackton (DM): It's Finian's turn.
[01:08:01.14 - 01:08:12.75] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I am going to, let's see… where can I go? I will bonus… let's see…
[01:08:14.81 - 01:08:17.33] Mike Sackton (DM): And Schwartz, you're next, and then YOLO goes again.
[01:08:19.51 - 01:08:26.67] Tim Sackton (Finnan): There's nowhere good. Is this the edge of the platform here? Like.
[01:08:26.67 - 01:08:27.31] Mike Sackton (DM): Are you…
[01:08:27.32 - 01:08:31.89] Tim Sackton (Finnan): The edge of the platform is what's shown on the map, there's not any other space.
[01:08:32.39 - 01:08:33.76] Mike Sackton (DM): Correct. Correct.
[01:08:33.76 - 01:08:34.81] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay.
[01:08:34.82 - 01:08:35.27] Mike Sackton (DM): He's.
[01:08:35.27 - 01:08:38.56] Tim Sackton (Finnan): name. It just came from off the platform.
[01:08:38.56 - 01:08:49.22] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, they're flying. They're like, they're almost more wind than shadow. And they came drifting from… they just came blowing in on the wind from off the platform.
[01:08:51.03 - 01:09:22.59] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay. It's not a great spot for me to go, but I am going to, bonus action… Hope justice can keep this occupied, and Misty Stapp… 2. What is going on here? Okay. Where is I? 1, 2, 3… 4… 5… 6, I'm gonna… So…
[01:09:22.59 - 01:09:24.87] Mike Sackton (DM): Is that ain That has thermal components?
[01:09:26.11 - 01:09:49.23] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm using… I'm casting it without a spell slot. I'm using my Fae Touch. Okay. bonus action. So I'm going to… Vanish and reappear over there. And then… So let me mark off that.
[01:09:56.86 - 01:10:14.83] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay, Finian is scared. I don't like this. And, begins chanting again, playing on his little flute, actually. And… Do I have to make a roll?
[01:10:15.38 - 01:10:17.12] Mike Sackton (DM): Are you casting a… what spell are you casting?
[01:10:17.88 - 01:10:19.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): mirror image.
[01:10:20.45 - 01:10:27.38] unknown_speaker: Yes. The wind, again, blows down. Every time… like, it seems like when you're trying to summon strong magical effects, there's this…
[01:10:27.38 - 01:10:29.82] Mike Sackton (DM): This wind comes and tries to steal your…
[01:10:29.82 - 01:10:30.82] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Dean.
[01:10:32.47 - 01:10:33.76] unknown_speaker: Don't falter at all.
[01:10:35.17 - 01:10:42.06] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And, you now see four Finians next to each other.
[01:10:42.69 - 01:10:43.60] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Whoa.
[01:10:43.60 - 01:10:53.19] Tim Sackton (Finnan): All standing, looking at the wolves, unhappily.
[01:10:53.79 - 01:10:54.36] Mike Sackton (DM): Justin?
[01:10:54.36 - 01:10:58.26] unknown_speaker: I'm over at Justice, like, what's going on, dude?
[01:11:00.05 - 01:11:00.37] David Schwartz (Justas): That was mine.
[01:11:00.37 - 01:11:03.31] Tim Sackton (Finnan): bonus act. I can't give inspiration a lot.
[01:11:05.59 - 01:11:06.69] Mike Sackton (DM): Or, shorts.
[01:11:09.08 - 01:11:24.67] David Schwartz (Justas): Justice, touches on a necklace a, this little bear figurine with the head of a wolf, he's casting Spiritual Weapon? Do I need to do anything, or the… that just… Is the wind trying to steal my breath, or…
[01:11:24.67 - 01:11:27.30] unknown_speaker: But Wayne does translate… yes, does it have verbal components?
[01:11:27.80 - 01:11:29.31] Mike Sackton (DM): It is verbal, right?
[01:11:29.31 - 01:11:30.74] David Schwartz (Justas): It does have verbal components.
[01:11:30.74 - 01:11:32.19] Mike Sackton (DM): I'm interested, so I'd make a con safe.
[01:11:35.52 - 01:11:37.39] David Schwartz (Justas): Ugh, that's a 4.
[01:11:37.79 - 01:11:43.37] unknown_speaker: So, you feel like a choking? You could definitely… you could… you could push through it?
[01:11:43.62 - 01:11:47.69] Mike Sackton (DM): It would… it would hurt, but you could cast the spell anyway, or you could let the wind steal it.
[01:11:48.19 - 01:11:49.86] David Schwartz (Justas): No, that's just fine to hurt.
[01:11:50.42 - 01:11:51.73] Mike Sackton (DM): You take 4 points of damage.
[01:11:52.65 - 01:12:09.50] David Schwartz (Justas): Awesome. Alright, and, hoists his battle axe, and then a glowing, bluish, identical copy of it appears next to him, and he swings with both of them at once. I'm using a bonus action.
[01:12:09.50 - 01:12:10.51] Mike Sackton (DM): That's actually a cat, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:10.83 - 01:12:12.84] David Schwartz (Justas): Regularly, yeah. So, alright.
[01:12:13.99 - 01:12:14.59] Mike Sackton (DM): So you're…
[01:12:14.59 - 01:12:16.06] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): All these extra people coming from?
[01:12:17.29 - 01:12:18.28] David Schwartz (Justas): 19?
[01:12:18.28 - 01:12:18.81] Mike Sackton (DM): That hits?
[01:12:20.44 - 01:12:22.94] unknown_speaker: That's 5 points damage…
[01:12:23.09 - 01:12:29.29] David Schwartz (Justas): And then the spiritual weapon… Same effect, that's, 23…
[01:12:29.29 - 01:12:29.82] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, that hits.
[01:12:30.36 - 01:12:30.75] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I bet.
[01:12:30.75 - 01:12:33.55] David Schwartz (Justas): And that is 11 points of damage.
[01:12:34.78 - 01:12:36.22] Mike Sackton (DM): Make a deck save.
[01:12:37.38 - 01:12:40.85] David Schwartz (Justas): That is not a thing that I do. That's a 6.
[01:12:41.13 - 01:12:53.95] Mike Sackton (DM): You take two points of cold damage as the… your weapons just smash into it, chipping away ice, and it shivers a little bit, and these shards of ice come flying at you, and they just sneak through the cracks of your armor.
[01:12:54.45 - 01:12:55.20] unknown_speaker: Awesome.
[01:12:55.47 - 01:13:04.06] Mike Sackton (DM): And… YOLO, you're up. You can redeem yourself. You're on the ground, and the wolf is standing on top of you.
[01:13:04.77 - 01:13:07.22] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, do I have to take an action to get up again?
[01:13:07.22 - 01:13:09.91] Mike Sackton (DM): If you want to stand up, you have to use half your move.
[01:13:13.42 - 01:13:15.59] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Half my move to stand up. Okay, well…
[01:13:15.59 - 01:13:28.92] Mike Sackton (DM): Also, you feel this… this… this, fang that's stuck in your… And your neck pulse with cold, and you take, 3 points of… Cold damage.
[01:13:30.32 - 01:13:34.62] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Alright. I will fire my heavy crossbow.
[01:13:35.63 - 01:13:39.33] unknown_speaker: Are you switching weapons to your heavy crossbow, or you're doing your two white crossbows?
[01:13:39.85 - 01:13:41.56] Mike Sackton (DM): You don't have a heavy crust, though.
[01:13:42.53 - 01:13:47.75] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, I was looking at the, they're only…
[01:13:47.75 - 01:13:57.00] Mike Sackton (DM): thing… the push effect. I know, but you didn't keep your heavy crossbow. Remember, you only have the two things you held onto, which were your two-hand crossbows?
[01:13:57.00 - 01:14:00.24] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I thought I only had the two. Okay, I didn't know there was a different crossbow. Okay.
[01:14:00.24 - 01:14:06.21] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, there's also a heavy crossbow, which… You might have, it's like a big thing. It's two-handed.
[01:14:07.31 - 01:14:08.83] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I see, I didn't realize that.
[01:14:09.19 - 01:14:09.75] unknown_speaker: Yeah.
[01:14:09.75 - 01:14:12.44] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): anyways, I shoot with a crossbow.
[01:14:14.07 - 01:14:15.59] Mike Sackton (DM): Standing up!
[01:14:15.89 - 01:14:16.93] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, I stand up first.
[01:14:16.93 - 01:14:17.28] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:14:17.28 - 01:14:18.14] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Shoot with a crossbow, yes.
[01:14:19.49 - 01:14:20.39] Mike Sackton (DM): 12 misses.
[01:14:21.31 - 01:14:23.87] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): And… I could shoot again.
[01:14:23.87 - 01:14:24.61] unknown_speaker: Yep.
[01:14:26.98 - 01:14:27.56] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 2020.
[01:14:27.56 - 01:14:29.76] Mike Sackton (DM): Two heads! You can act.
[01:14:31.13 - 01:14:37.86] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's, where's the image there? But then… That's 5…
[01:14:37.86 - 01:14:39.30] unknown_speaker: Add a D4 as well.
[01:14:39.57 - 01:14:40.46] Mike Sackton (DM): D45.
[01:14:40.46 - 01:14:44.15] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): for the fire damage. Yeah. How do I roll a D4 here?
[01:14:44.15 - 01:14:52.23] Mike Sackton (DM): If you just click on the little dice icon in the bottom… Oh, oh, on the character sheet, yeah. On the character sheet, you can just… so 3. So that was 8 total…
[01:14:52.23 - 01:14:54.28] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Me, but you can use it.
[01:14:54.28 - 01:14:55.60] Mike Sackton (DM): just use TIMS.
[01:14:55.84 - 01:15:01.77] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I was just showing how to roll it, but I realized it doesn't actually show you anything useful whatsoever.
[01:15:01.77 - 01:15:07.16] Mike Sackton (DM): So… That was your two attacks, with your bonus action, you could make a third attack, or you could do something else.
[01:15:08.62 - 01:15:10.34] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Remember, you got advantage.
[01:15:11.04 - 01:15:21.26] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So, yeah, yeah, but first… Immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one psionic energy die to deal 1d8.
[01:15:21.26 - 01:15:21.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Nath.
[01:15:21.66 - 01:15:25.51] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): free force damage. So that's 9 more.
[01:15:26.27 - 01:15:41.76] Mike Sackton (DM): 9 more damage, okay. So, as Yellow shoots your remaining arrow, it flies towards the creature, and you just guide it unerringly with your psychic power, and it goes right through its head, and it falls down dead.
[01:15:42.61 - 01:15:43.18] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice.
[01:15:44.45 - 01:15:46.73] David Schwartz (Justas): Nicely done, justice calls out.
[01:15:48.67 - 01:15:52.12] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah. I will…
[01:15:53.25 - 01:15:59.13] unknown_speaker: Use the rest of my move. Which I should have, like, 15 feet left. Yep.
[01:16:00.12 - 01:16:04.48] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): But where should I go?
[01:16:07.98 - 01:16:10.18] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Then I'll yell out, kill the other wolf!
[01:16:11.26 - 01:16:14.43] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah. Go there, I have to… I have to go there to attack that one.
[01:16:15.29 - 01:16:21.22] Mike Sackton (DM): You probably don't want to go too close to it. You don't need to be in Meiwei, you have… you have crossbows.
[01:16:21.22 - 01:16:22.66] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 30 foot range.
[01:16:23.15 - 01:16:24.77] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): But Yolo wants to be.
[01:16:24.77 - 01:16:27.48] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Hayley, obviously. You can come stand next to me.
[01:16:29.59 - 01:16:31.67] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, I can't get that far, though. I was, like, over here.
[01:16:31.67 - 01:16:33.28] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You only have 15 feet, right?
[01:16:33.76 - 01:16:41.69] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah, I'll just… I'll go right there. And then, wait, do I have another action, you're saying? Because I have a bonus action.
[01:16:41.69 - 01:16:44.89] Mike Sackton (DM): You have a bonus action, which you could use.
[01:16:44.94 - 01:16:51.42] unknown_speaker: To make a second… because with two-weapon fighting, you can make a second attack with your bonus action.
[01:16:51.97 - 01:17:03.24] Mike Sackton (DM): So you can shoot one crossbow each with your regular attack, and then you… somehow… you have a third hand, I don't know, I don't know how it works, but you somehow get a crossbow bolt out of your quiver, and shoot a third time in the same…
[01:17:03.80 - 01:17:04.98] Tim Sackton (Finnan): H4.
[01:17:04.98 - 01:17:06.38] Mike Sackton (DM): That's what the feed is for, yes.
[01:17:06.70 - 01:17:08.25] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Shoot a third time.
[01:17:08.25 - 01:17:08.73] Mike Sackton (DM): That's right.
[01:17:08.73 - 01:17:11.35] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 29. Now I'm rolling dice.
[01:17:11.35 - 01:17:12.38] Mike Sackton (DM): There you go.
[01:17:12.38 - 01:17:12.78] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's right.
[01:17:12.78 - 01:17:13.50] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Hey, that's a crack.
[01:17:13.50 - 01:17:21.90] Mike Sackton (DM): You critted! So, did you… did you roll twice damage, roll damage again, and then also roll 2d4?
[01:17:24.37 - 01:17:27.22] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): A 7 and a 9, and then…
[01:17:29.05 - 01:17:32.32] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Well, it's just a 5, so it's 12 plus 2d4.
[01:17:37.30 - 01:17:40.03] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 5 is the 2D4.
[01:17:40.32 - 01:17:41.19] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:17:44.44 - 01:17:56.93] Mike Sackton (DM): So… YOLO finishes your turn. Out of the… Out of the body… out of… as this ice shatters? Four little.
[01:17:58.10 - 01:17:59.46] unknown_speaker: Four little…
[01:18:00.53 - 01:18:12.08] Mike Sackton (DM): Motes, almost, of, like… of life? Wait, where is… so, your white spell is… You have a license?
[01:18:12.08 - 01:18:15.28] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I don't know how to do ranges on here, it's 40 feet from me.
[01:18:15.28 - 01:18:16.90] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[01:18:17.44 - 01:18:22.81] unknown_speaker: One of these comes flying by Finian.
[01:18:22.92 - 01:18:27.09] Mike Sackton (DM): And as it gets close to you.
[01:18:27.73 - 01:18:30.56] unknown_speaker: It darts towards your white, and it goes out.
[01:18:34.60 - 01:18:36.04] Tim Sackton (Finnan): My light goes out?
[01:18:36.04 - 01:18:37.64] unknown_speaker: My light spell vanishes, yes.
[01:18:37.64 - 01:18:38.17] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Okay.
[01:18:38.17 - 01:18:39.02] unknown_speaker: Whoa.
[01:18:39.02 - 01:18:40.19] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So how dark is that?
[01:18:40.87 - 01:18:50.33] Mike Sackton (DM): No, these two, this point right here is shedding dim light, and this point right here is shedding dim light. Here, let me put the…
[01:18:57.76 - 01:18:59.48] Mike Sackton (DM): Everything that's now black?
[01:19:00.32 - 01:19:03.92] unknown_speaker: is… dark. Does anybody have darkvision?
[01:19:06.27 - 01:19:07.84] Tim Sackton (Finnan): That's why I have the light spell.
[01:19:09.43 - 01:19:10.60] David Kong (Ekko): Can't cool of Dark Vision?
[01:19:12.06 - 01:19:13.32] Mike Sackton (DM): Kenku don't have darkvision.
[01:19:15.15 - 01:19:16.31] unknown_speaker: So, none of you have darkvision.
[01:19:17.28 - 01:19:17.86] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Nope.
[01:19:17.86 - 01:19:25.75] unknown_speaker: So basically, it reduces the vision to that. That's fine. And then…
[01:19:26.74 - 01:19:28.15] David Kong (Ekko): Echo.
[01:19:28.15 - 01:19:34.09] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, these guys are going. Two of them swarm by Echo.
[01:19:34.09 - 01:19:36.65] unknown_speaker: And one of them swarms…
[01:19:36.65 - 01:19:37.86] Mike Sackton (DM): towards YOLO.
[01:19:41.61 - 01:19:46.48] unknown_speaker: And they are… as they swarm around you.
[01:19:47.70 - 01:19:57.18] Mike Sackton (DM): These, they, they… Actually, one swarms to each of you. All, Drain, YOLO, and Echo all make a constitution saving throw.
[01:20:03.00 - 01:20:03.72] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Ugh.
[01:20:04.42 - 01:20:04.91] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 23.
[01:20:04.91 - 01:20:05.53] David Kong (Ekko): 50.
[01:20:07.14 - 01:20:12.72] Mike Sackton (DM): These… each one of them just, like. Shimmers and shivers and this burst of, like…
[01:20:12.81 - 01:20:13.64] unknown_speaker: Ice?
[01:20:13.94 - 01:20:16.40] Mike Sackton (DM): Comes flying out around your face.
[01:20:16.40 - 01:20:20.99] unknown_speaker: YOLO and Echo sort of blink and dodge in time. Drain, you're blinded.
[01:20:22.02 - 01:20:23.10] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, great.
[01:20:24.40 - 01:20:26.72] Mike Sackton (DM): And now it is Echo's turn.
[01:20:28.43 - 01:20:33.55] David Kong (Ekko): Am I engaged with the two… the two things? The chickpe, the wisps?
[01:20:33.55 - 01:20:39.62] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, the wisp is, like, buzzing around your head. Okay. It's only about the size of a… Robin?
[01:20:41.57 - 01:20:46.67] David Kong (Ekko): That's fine. Alright, I will, I will do a claw attack against the one that's buzzing me.
[01:20:46.67 - 01:20:49.77] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay. Right?
[01:20:49.77 - 01:20:53.62] David Kong (Ekko): That is… 20.
[01:20:54.01 - 01:20:54.64] Mike Sackton (DM): That hits.
[01:20:55.68 - 01:21:12.23] David Kong (Ekko): And… I do 2D6 plus 5. That's cool. Let's see, so… Oh, 2, okay, there we go. 2D6… That's 8 plus 13?
[01:21:12.80 - 01:21:24.67] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Well, it doesn't matter because I'm blinded, but it says that I do have darkvision, I don't know how, but it's right here under my saving throws are done with certain dice. I have passive perception of 15 and darkvision of 60 feet.
[01:21:25.65 - 01:21:26.33] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): O?
[01:21:27.83 - 01:21:30.83] Kate Sackton (Jrain): But I'm blind. I don't know.
[01:21:30.83 - 01:21:32.84] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Wait, where do you get the acronym from?
[01:21:33.34 - 01:21:37.61] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I don't know, maybe I took a feat, God only knows. I'm just reading my sheet.
[01:21:38.12 - 01:21:39.87] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): How does D&D work?
[01:21:39.87 - 01:21:45.93] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It doesn't say, dark… are you… Mike can… I don't think you have darkvision.
[01:21:46.45 - 01:21:50.49] Mike Sackton (DM): Maybe I don't. I don't know, I just… Where are you looking that it says you have darkvision?
[01:21:50.94 - 01:21:58.56] Kate Sackton (Jrain): If I look in my actions… It tells me to… It's like, your actions in combat.
[01:21:58.56 - 01:22:01.64] Mike Sackton (DM): Your beast has dark visions.
[01:22:01.64 - 01:22:04.13] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Okay, thank you.
[01:22:04.13 - 01:22:09.88] Mike Sackton (DM): So, as Echo swings a claw up at this annoying little beast, it just… you kill it.
[01:22:09.99 - 01:22:16.43] David Kong (Ekko): Okay. Alright, I will then move, and engage the bear, the wolf.
[01:22:16.69 - 01:22:17.35] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:22:18.21 - 01:22:31.50] David Kong (Ekko): And… I will do my bite attack to the… the wolf. Some Baron-wolf action. And that is what… Dope, that's a 12th.
[01:22:31.98 - 01:22:34.85] Mike Sackton (DM): Dope. Okay, that misses.
[01:22:34.85 - 01:22:42.05] David Kong (Ekko): Okay. And… that's my turn. Oh wait, can I bonus action do anything? What can I do with the bonus action?
[01:22:42.36 - 01:22:45.59] Mike Sackton (DM): I don't think polar bears have much with bonus action.
[01:22:47.33 - 01:22:48.89] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, polar bear echo.
[01:22:48.89 - 01:22:50.02] Mike Sackton (DM): drain Europe.
[01:22:50.46 - 01:22:52.64] David Kong (Ekko): I, I, I, I bonus action scratched my ass.
[01:22:53.02 - 01:22:54.53] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, train your eye.
[01:22:57.75 - 01:23:20.53] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Well… Vaguely remembering… That I was in the middle of a bunch of enemies, and now I can't see anything. I… fall to the ground in the sort of vague direction of where the Zimca woman was to sort of get out of the way, if at all possibly can.
[01:23:20.84 - 01:23:28.30] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay. Is, oh, is anybody doing anything about the Zimka woman who's currently bleeding to death on the ground?
[01:23:28.87 - 01:23:29.65] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): -Oh.
[01:23:31.01 - 01:23:35.55] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I… I… I can. I can't. Since it's my turn.
[01:23:37.02 - 01:23:53.34] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay. One of the shades disappears. Tim, make a, Hold on, where did I… Make a strength saving throw.
[01:23:56.28 - 01:23:57.45] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 19!
[01:23:57.86 - 01:23:58.56] Mike Sackton (DM): Ow!
[01:23:59.01 - 01:24:00.20] Tim Sackton (Finnan): The best I can roll.
[01:24:02.94 - 01:24:08.46] unknown_speaker: This shade appears right next to you. Wait, it appears, like, amongst the four of you.
[01:24:08.52 - 01:24:16.83] Mike Sackton (DM): And it's like the wind just shivers as it appears, and you feel like you're pushed backwards, but you resist, you don't get, you don't get pushed.
[01:24:16.92 - 01:24:20.14] unknown_speaker: And then it attacks you.
[01:24:28.24 - 01:24:29.08] unknown_speaker: What's Tracy?
[01:24:30.12 - 01:24:30.86] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 15.
[01:24:31.54 - 01:24:32.90] unknown_speaker: It misses.
[01:24:34.80 - 01:24:53.47] Mike Sackton (DM): The second shade… Appears… The second shade attacks… Actually, it… you know what? It appears on top of Finn as well. Make another strength saving throw.
[01:24:56.69 - 01:24:57.64] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 14.
[01:24:58.63 - 01:25:00.50] Mike Sackton (DM): You resist a second time!
[01:25:01.25 - 01:25:04.59] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice. As these things are trying to push you off the side.
[01:25:06.16 - 01:25:07.65] Mike Sackton (DM): But they don't succeed.
[01:25:08.74 - 01:25:10.01] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Because there's 4 of them.
[01:25:10.84 - 01:25:14.28] Mike Sackton (DM): Well, how does, how does Mirror Image work?
[01:25:15.84 - 01:25:17.73] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Did one hit me?
[01:25:17.94 - 01:25:19.28] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, one just critted.
[01:25:19.69 - 01:25:21.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It hits a mirror instead.
[01:25:21.81 - 01:25:24.24] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay. Whatever you're…
[01:25:24.24 - 01:25:33.84] Tim Sackton (Finnan): One of… one of the four Finians vanishes in a puff of, light, and… well, you can't actually see… nobody can see what happens. Correct.
[01:25:33.84 - 01:25:34.60] Mike Sackton (DM): Yes.
[01:25:34.60 - 01:25:35.26] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[01:25:35.26 - 01:25:37.62] Mike Sackton (DM): But Wolf, then.
[01:25:38.04 - 01:25:39.32] unknown_speaker: walks in…
[01:25:39.34 - 01:25:47.40] Mike Sackton (DM): swings at… Justice. You said you have a 19 AC?
[01:25:52.84 - 01:25:55.63] Mike Sackton (DM): It just hits you, just barely.
[01:25:55.94 - 01:26:00.31] unknown_speaker: You get knocked to the ground. You take…
[01:26:00.62 - 01:26:03.95] Mike Sackton (DM): 11 points of piercing damage, and 2 points of cold damage.
[01:26:04.95 - 01:26:05.68] David Schwartz (Justas): Awesome.
[01:26:06.27 - 01:26:11.42] unknown_speaker: And then, as you're on the ground, it weeps at your jaw, it goes for your throat.
[01:26:14.02 - 01:26:19.62] Mike Sackton (DM): Tearing into it. And you take another…
[01:26:20.46 - 01:26:25.63] unknown_speaker: 6 points of slashing damage, and again, it leaves a tooth. There's a jagged tooth in your neck.
[01:26:27.40 - 01:26:31.48] Mike Sackton (DM): And now it is the Zimko woman's turn?
[01:26:31.93 - 01:26:38.36] unknown_speaker: Doesn't look super healthy… let's see how she does. Well, she doesn't fail, she…
[01:26:38.36 - 01:26:40.29] Mike Sackton (DM): Does not fail her death saving throw.
[01:26:40.32 - 01:26:41.25] unknown_speaker: Vinnian, you're up.
[01:26:43.20 - 01:26:50.79] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, okay, do I have any idea how many shades are around? I think it's two, right?
[01:26:50.79 - 01:26:54.36] unknown_speaker: You know there's two of them appeared, but it's hard to actually see them.
[01:26:54.36 - 01:26:56.20] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And they can obviously see in the dark.
[01:26:56.20 - 01:26:57.25] Mike Sackton (DM): I can see in the dark, yes.
[01:26:59.44 - 01:27:19.88] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Too many things to do. Okay, I will… Bonus action, Shout a… A magic word of healing? Just, like, a faint sort of resonant,
[01:27:19.88 - 01:27:21.12] unknown_speaker: a song.
[01:27:21.93 - 01:27:24.08] Tim Sackton (Finnan): at the Zimco woman.
[01:27:24.31 - 01:27:24.74] unknown_speaker: Okay.
[01:27:24.74 - 01:27:26.31] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Casting Healing Word.
[01:27:26.48 - 01:27:26.81] Mike Sackton (DM): Yep.
[01:27:29.21 - 01:27:32.23] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So… That heals her 10.
[01:27:32.23 - 01:27:33.00] unknown_speaker: Yep.
[01:27:34.01 - 01:27:43.52] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And then, I am going to… use… Vicious mockery on one of the shades next to me.
[01:27:43.52 - 01:27:43.91] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yes, yes.
[01:27:43.91 - 01:27:44.88] Tim Sackton (Finnan): saving throw?
[01:27:45.26 - 01:27:47.00] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So I will curse…
[01:27:47.00 - 01:27:55.67] Tim Sackton (Finnan): the spirits of… The wild wind. DC15 Wisdom Safe?
[01:27:59.84 - 01:28:00.42] Mike Sackton (DM): I made it.
[01:28:02.34 - 01:28:08.05] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And then… I've got my…
[01:28:10.43 - 01:28:12.81] unknown_speaker: Justice, you're next, while Tim decides what he does.
[01:28:13.18 - 01:28:15.71] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm thinking about whether I want to run.
[01:28:20.29 - 01:28:25.28] Mike Sackton (DM): Well, Justice Schwartz, go ahead and go while Tim thinks about what he does. You'll have a while before the enemies would have a chance.
[01:28:26.19 - 01:28:37.92] David Schwartz (Justas): First I'll make two attacks on the, the wolf, with my axe and with the… 13? 13's a mess.
[01:28:37.92 - 01:28:43.42] Mike Sackton (DM): You take 2 points of damage, or 3 points of damage, and you feel the icy tooth in your neck melt away.
[01:28:44.54 - 01:28:47.45] David Schwartz (Justas): Awesome. I'm sorry.
[01:28:47.45 - 01:28:52.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I can't actually move my character, Mike, because I'm… In a fog of war.
[01:28:52.10 - 01:28:52.75] Mike Sackton (DM): Bah.
[01:28:52.75 - 01:28:57.36] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): But I… I don't want… I don't like being this close to the edge. I'm gonna run…
[01:28:58.95 - 01:29:02.93] Mike Sackton (DM): Now you should be able to move it. Charts, the AC is 15, just tell me if you hit.
[01:29:07.06 - 01:29:11.22] David Schwartz (Justas): That's a natural 20 on one of them, and a miss on the other.
[01:29:11.62 - 01:29:12.41] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:29:12.79 - 01:29:16.45] David Schwartz (Justas): So, that is 9 points damage…
[01:29:18.11 - 01:29:19.09] Mike Sackton (DM): 9 total?
[01:29:19.09 - 01:29:23.46] David Schwartz (Justas): 9 total, yep. That wolves, underwolf.
[01:29:24.27 - 01:29:28.07] Mike Sackton (DM): It's badly hit, hurt, but it's not dead. YOLO, you're up.
[01:29:28.07 - 01:29:35.63] David Schwartz (Justas): Hold up, I'll use, I'll do… Bonus action, I'll cast Light.
[01:29:36.34 - 01:29:37.25] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Mmm. Right?
[01:29:37.25 - 01:29:38.26] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It's not a bonus action.
[01:29:38.26 - 01:29:39.88] Mike Sackton (DM): That's not a… that's not a bonus action.
[01:29:39.88 - 01:29:41.68] David Schwartz (Justas): It's not a cantrip?
[01:29:42.01 - 01:29:44.61] Mike Sackton (DM): You can't cast anything. It's a cantrip, but it's an action.
[01:29:45.80 - 01:29:46.44] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[01:29:46.44 - 01:29:48.26] David Schwartz (Justas): Camp trips can't be…
[01:29:48.26 - 01:29:53.85] Mike Sackton (DM): You can't cast… unless it says bonus action on the casting time, you can't cast it as a bonus action.
[01:29:54.03 - 01:29:54.64] David Schwartz (Justas): Got it.
[01:29:54.84 - 01:30:02.15] Mike Sackton (DM): If you could cast your spell on the bonus action, you could cast your cantrip in the same turn, but… Okay. YOLO, you're out.
[01:30:04.90 - 01:30:08.25] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So there's a Chasm Wisp right behind me, right?
[01:30:08.25 - 01:30:16.09] Mike Sackton (DM): It's like a little ice creature the size, or a little glowing shard the size of a robin. Echo killed one with white blouse.
[01:30:16.99 - 01:30:23.44] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I will pop a crossbow bolt in it. Okay. 25 to hit.
[01:30:23.56 - 01:30:24.15] Mike Sackton (DM): That hits.
[01:30:25.34 - 01:30:30.42] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's the one right next to me.
[01:30:30.68 - 01:30:31.38] Mike Sackton (DM): Yep, how much.
[01:30:31.38 - 01:30:37.84] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, I rolled, I wrote, oops, 9. And then… Cross Evolve?
[01:30:37.84 - 01:30:38.63] Mike Sackton (DM): Kills it.
[01:30:39.37 - 01:31:01.03] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): With the plus the D4, okay. And… Continuing his graceful spin, YOLO. Should I just take out the other one, or should I hit the wolf? I'll hit the wolf two more times. 15 to hit.
[01:31:01.03 - 01:31:01.64] Mike Sackton (DM): That hits.
[01:31:03.48 - 01:31:27.24] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): And then I'll use… let's see, so I roll… that's 8, and then I roll my… D4… That's another 2… And then I'll use that, what was it called? The Psionic Strike, to do another…
[01:31:27.24 - 01:31:29.47] Mike Sackton (DM): that again, okay? So tell me how.
[01:31:29.47 - 01:31:30.53] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 11…
[01:31:31.42 - 01:31:32.32] Mike Sackton (DM): 11…
[01:31:32.77 - 01:31:34.23] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 21 total.
[01:31:35.37 - 01:31:36.45] Mike Sackton (DM): YOLO!
[01:31:36.45 - 01:31:40.92] unknown_speaker: Kills the second wolf. With another sciatic strike to the head.
[01:31:41.92 - 01:31:46.10] Mike Sackton (DM): But you also take 4 points of damage from its tooth that's still embedded in your neck.
[01:31:46.87 - 01:31:47.80] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I'll let that get you?
[01:31:47.80 - 01:31:48.59] David Kong (Ekko): your head.
[01:31:51.58 - 01:31:54.71] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Ugh. What, you mean my endless success?
[01:31:54.86 - 01:31:58.87] unknown_speaker: Yeah, don't let your endless success get… keep… get…
[01:31:58.87 - 01:31:59.56] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): their head.
[01:32:00.94 - 01:32:02.98] Mike Sackton (DM): Having killed both of the wolves?
[01:32:03.21 - 01:32:16.12] unknown_speaker: This little… this little, Creature. comes over and… Bursts a burst of… Like, needling ice.
[01:32:16.63 - 01:32:17.95] Mike Sackton (DM): towards YOLO.
[01:32:21.34 - 01:32:28.05] Mike Sackton (DM): But… it just goes… All around you, but somehow none of the little ice shards hit you.
[01:32:30.53 - 01:32:31.81] unknown_speaker: The second one…
[01:32:33.03 - 01:32:35.72] Mike Sackton (DM): comes by Finian and does the same thing.
[01:32:41.23 - 01:32:42.99] unknown_speaker: Much more effectively.
[01:32:43.49 - 01:32:46.44] Mike Sackton (DM): As the ice shards go flying right towards…
[01:32:46.66 - 01:32:48.24] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Luxury duplicate.
[01:32:48.46 - 01:32:50.20] Mike Sackton (DM): an illusionary duplicate, so you have one left.
[01:32:50.20 - 01:32:52.85] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Now you can see a second one… I've got one left.
[01:32:54.09 - 01:32:55.31] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, Echo, you're up.
[01:33:00.41 - 01:33:03.40] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna just yell, little help.
[01:33:06.09 - 01:33:06.59] unknown_speaker: Oh, girl.
[01:33:09.90 - 01:33:14.84] David Kong (Ekko): Sorry, I'm dealing with it. Sorry, just hold on for one second.
[01:33:14.84 - 01:33:15.17] Mike Sackton (DM): There's a guy.
[01:33:15.17 - 01:33:18.82] David Kong (Ekko): Actually, can you just roll attacks for me? For just polar bear attack? Bear and bite?
[01:33:21.39 - 01:33:25.39] Mike Sackton (DM): you can't really… all you can see to hit is the Chasm Wisp.
[01:33:26.39 - 01:33:27.60] David Kong (Ekko): All I can see to hit his what?
[01:33:28.19 - 01:33:29.79] Tim Sackton (Finnan): The little, the little…
[01:33:30.27 - 01:33:38.60] Mike Sackton (DM): I guess this… that shade you can see, no, you can see one of the shades. Actually, you can see that shade. Somebody can just roll Echo's attack against that shade.
[01:33:42.03 - 01:33:45.56] Tim Sackton (Finnan): the 16 and a 19 without modifiers, so I assume…
[01:33:45.56 - 01:33:46.95] Mike Sackton (DM): It does both hit, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:47.79 - 01:33:48.34] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice.
[01:33:48.34 - 01:33:49.88] David Kong (Ekko): Alright, sorry about that, y'all.
[01:33:49.88 - 01:33:50.59] Mike Sackton (DM): That's okay.
[01:33:50.59 - 01:33:51.49] Tim Sackton (Finnan): No worries.
[01:33:51.49 - 01:33:54.81] David Kong (Ekko): White thing. Alright, so what, what just happened? Did I, did I… what am I attacking?
[01:33:54.81 - 01:33:57.71] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Both your attacks hit the shade, but I haven't rolled damage yet.
[01:33:57.71 - 01:34:05.00] David Kong (Ekko): Perfect. So it's 2d6 plus 5 and 1d8 plus… Where's the other one?
[01:34:06.01 - 01:34:07.65] Mike Sackton (DM): Just tell me what the total damage is.
[01:34:07.93 - 01:34:31.52] David Kong (Ekko): Okay. Here, let me, let me roll it right now. Okay, so… I wanna roll… Oh, I can roll multiple dice at the same time, right? So 1DA, and then… 2D6, and this is plus 11. 21 damage total. Or 20 damage total, sorry, 20 damage total.
[01:34:31.79 - 01:34:35.85] Mike Sackton (DM): You… you slam into this… oh, but wait, hold on, there's this…
[01:34:37.15 - 01:34:38.80] Tim Sackton (Finnan): This one here, I assume.
[01:34:39.19 - 01:34:45.84] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't seem to hurt it as badly as you wished you had.
[01:34:45.84 - 01:34:55.03] Tim Sackton (Finnan): But you can… you can do… no, Moon Druids at level 6 don't do… Yeah, you could do radiant. Legendary force damage with their attacks, or Radiant.
[01:34:55.03 - 01:35:12.30] Mike Sackton (DM): Nevermind! Your claws glow with the strength of your inner… of the strength of the chasm's magic, and it tears through it, even though it seems resistant to regular claws. Yeah, Kate, Drain can see again.
[01:35:13.26 - 01:35:24.61] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Oh, wonderful! Love how that works. Well then… I…
[01:35:30.77 - 01:35:39.14] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I guess I'm just gonna… Is it even possible to shoot at a chasm Wisp from close range? Sure!
[01:35:39.87 - 01:35:41.03] Mike Sackton (DM): You have Sharpshooter, right?
[01:35:41.82 - 01:35:42.86] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Yeah, true.
[01:35:42.86 - 01:35:44.70] Mike Sackton (DM): So, you can shoot in melee.
[01:35:45.92 - 01:35:47.73] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Fine. I do.
[01:35:53.51 - 01:35:55.53] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I, however, roll a 12.
[01:35:55.89 - 01:35:57.18] Mike Sackton (DM): A 12 will miss.
[01:35:57.60 - 01:36:00.87] Kate Sackton (Jrain): But you can take a second attack. I will try again.
[01:36:02.02 - 01:36:03.79] unknown_speaker: At first, you don't succeed.
[01:36:06.44 - 01:36:07.64] Kate Sackton (Jrain): 16.
[01:36:07.80 - 01:36:31.62] Mike Sackton (DM): That also misses. Okay, the shades, are really… Each… the shades, one of them… Swings… this one swings at… Finian. What's JC again? Is it 14 or 13?
[01:36:31.62 - 01:36:32.62] Tim Sackton (Finnan): 13.
[01:36:33.63 - 01:36:35.40] Mike Sackton (DM): It hit a… he'd rolled a 14.
[01:36:36.80 - 01:36:39.44] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna cutting words out again.
[01:36:39.67 - 01:36:40.38] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay?
[01:36:40.38 - 01:36:43.09] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It misses… well, yeah, it definitely misses.
[01:36:44.64 - 01:36:47.79] Mike Sackton (DM): And then the second shade… the second shade…
[01:36:47.79 - 01:36:49.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Evil.
[01:36:49.60 - 01:36:52.13] Mike Sackton (DM): appears… M…
[01:36:55.40 - 01:37:05.18] Mike Sackton (DM): And you're… it appears right on top of you, again. Shuddering with… with… with air. Make a strength saving throw.
[01:37:13.26 - 01:37:32.91] Mike Sackton (DM): Binion is tottering on the edge. The shade blows Finian towards the edge, and you're basically balanced on the edge. Any… any, like, you're… you're sort of… Inches from the edge, any push would knock you over. But, the shades do not still have an attack. And it's your turn.
[01:37:35.74 - 01:37:38.10] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I can't see anything.
[01:37:38.49 - 01:37:45.46] Mike Sackton (DM): No, correct. You're standing in the dark, on a precipice in the dark. You feel like if you move, you might fall.
[01:37:45.76 - 01:37:49.65] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm… I am going to use my action to cast light.
[01:37:50.35 - 01:37:50.81] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:37:52.12 - 01:37:52.49] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[01:37:52.49 - 01:37:54.99] Mike Sackton (DM): Now you can see! Let's reveal the world.
[01:37:56.85 - 01:38:04.13] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So, none of them can… Okay, I'm gonna run. 1, 2…
[01:38:04.17 - 01:38:05.26] unknown_speaker: 3…
[01:38:05.29 - 01:38:14.72] Tim Sackton (Finnan): for… Five… 6… One of those two shades was wounded, right?
[01:38:14.87 - 01:38:15.82] Mike Sackton (DM): Badly winded, yeah.
[01:38:16.91 - 01:38:18.55] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I will.
[01:38:18.55 - 01:38:18.89] Mike Sackton (DM): way.
[01:38:18.89 - 01:38:20.32] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Again, try to…
[01:38:20.49 - 01:38:21.73] unknown_speaker: Curse it.
[01:38:22.81 - 01:38:24.67] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, sorry, I cast Light.
[01:38:24.67 - 01:38:25.24] Mike Sackton (DM): Flight, yeah.
[01:38:26.44 - 01:38:30.05] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I will, bonus action, give justice and inspiration.
[01:38:30.78 - 01:38:32.37] Mike Sackton (DM): Justice, you're up!
[01:38:39.40 - 01:38:40.89] David Schwartz (Justas): Hmm, mmm, mmm.
[01:38:40.89 - 01:38:42.64] Mike Sackton (DM): You're gonna go axe one of the shades?
[01:38:45.78 - 01:38:48.62] David Schwartz (Justas): Am I in melee with the Chasm Wisp? Do I need to take that out first?
[01:38:49.00 - 01:38:51.82] unknown_speaker: You are, it's, like, buzzing around your head.
[01:38:51.82 - 01:38:53.08] Mike Sackton (DM): It's like the size of a robin.
[01:38:54.61 - 01:38:55.53] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah. Ignore it.
[01:38:55.53 - 01:38:56.31] David Schwartz (Justas): Chop that guy first.
[01:38:56.31 - 01:38:57.06] Tim Sackton (Finnan): shade.
[01:38:57.83 - 01:39:01.75] David Schwartz (Justas): I'm gonna ignore it. I'm gonna do what Min says, and go.
[01:39:01.92 - 01:39:03.26] unknown_speaker: Chop up the shades.
[01:39:03.75 - 01:39:04.76] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Here we go.
[01:39:05.39 - 01:39:09.85] Mike Sackton (DM): It, it does shoot its little icicle things at you.
[01:39:10.04 - 01:39:17.51] unknown_speaker: Oh, it actually hits you. This… this gust of needles come flying at you. You take…
[01:39:17.51 - 01:39:23.41] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Echo is a giant polar bear, so you have to be one below, but you can still kill the wounded shade.
[01:39:23.82 - 01:39:29.35] unknown_speaker: You take 3 points of damage as you run away from the robin. The top one is the wounded one.
[01:39:30.90 - 01:39:37.79] David Schwartz (Justas): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5… let me just come around, like, to the side.
[01:39:37.79 - 01:39:42.20] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah. You can also move your spiritual weapon, too, and put it anywhere you want.
[01:39:42.32 - 01:39:46.43] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah, it's just gonna fall out… next to me?
[01:39:46.43 - 01:39:47.17] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:39:47.17 - 01:39:50.69] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah. I'll attack the wounded one first.
[01:39:50.69 - 01:39:52.07] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay?
[01:39:53.43 - 01:39:56.00] David Schwartz (Justas): That is another natural 20!
[01:39:56.28 - 01:39:59.08] Mike Sackton (DM): That kills it. As far hit points.
[01:39:59.46 - 01:40:04.03] David Schwartz (Justas): And then Spiritual Weapon on the other one. That is another natural.
[01:40:04.03 - 01:40:06.30] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so…
[01:40:06.30 - 01:40:07.37] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Outrageous.
[01:40:07.37 - 01:40:09.57] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Nation is really doing a lot of work here.
[01:40:09.85 - 01:40:10.76] David Schwartz (Justas): Wow. Holy shit.
[01:40:11.30 - 01:40:12.51] Mike Sackton (DM): 18 damage.
[01:40:12.51 - 01:40:13.43] David Schwartz (Justas): 18.
[01:40:13.94 - 01:40:19.59] Mike Sackton (DM): It's badly hurt, that's more than half its health. Oh, wait, is this normal… is this a normal weapon attack?
[01:40:19.59 - 01:40:21.03] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Spiritual weapon, it's…
[01:40:21.03 - 01:40:28.08] Mike Sackton (DM): Oh, it's Spiritual Weapon. It's not a normal weapon attack. Yolo, you're up!
[01:40:33.61 - 01:40:34.84] Mike Sackton (DM): There's not much left.
[01:40:36.53 - 01:40:39.95] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I will… Fire at the shade.
[01:40:40.99 - 01:40:41.36] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:40:46.69 - 01:40:47.56] Mike Sackton (DM): Just crit?
[01:40:48.12 - 01:40:54.35] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yes. That's a 29 to hit. Okay. And a crit. Yeah.
[01:40:54.35 - 01:40:55.05] Mike Sackton (DM): That hits.
[01:40:55.69 - 01:40:56.22] unknown_speaker: Sorry.
[01:40:56.22 - 01:41:00.83] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): role, Once, for damage, that's 8, and then I roll again.
[01:41:00.98 - 01:41:04.80] Mike Sackton (DM): Yep. Is that correct? Yep. That's another 6, so…
[01:41:04.80 - 01:41:06.71] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 14, and then a little 2D4.
[01:41:07.40 - 01:41:10.07] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You only had the D6, not the plus 4.
[01:41:10.85 - 01:41:13.29] Mike Sackton (DM): But then you roll 2d4 fire damage.
[01:41:13.29 - 01:41:13.63] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[01:41:13.63 - 01:41:17.24] unknown_speaker: And it has currently 2 hit points. Oh, oops, I just damaged…
[01:41:17.31 - 01:41:24.56] Mike Sackton (DM): I think I just damaged YOLO instead of… oh, no, I didn't. I didn't, I didn't. It only has 2 hit points left, so your 2D4 fire damage definitely kills it.
[01:41:25.39 - 01:41:26.78] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Bam. And then…
[01:41:26.78 - 01:41:34.11] Mike Sackton (DM): YOLO continues to clear the field, twirling and shooting his… after that first mistake, you've really got your footing.
[01:41:34.63 - 01:41:41.53] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Totally. And then I have 2 more attacks remaining, right, so I can take out both Chasm Whisps, hopefully.
[01:41:41.53 - 01:41:43.13] Mike Sackton (DM): Was that your first attack, yeah?
[01:41:43.13 - 01:41:44.10] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): You good?
[01:41:44.10 - 01:41:44.59] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah?
[01:41:44.59 - 01:41:49.27] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Second one is a 15 to hit on the one close to me.
[01:41:49.27 - 01:41:52.84] Mike Sackton (DM): They… they dart around, they're fast, they have high AC, you miss it.
[01:41:52.84 - 01:41:57.23] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): And… with my third attack… I've had…
[01:41:57.23 - 01:41:58.21] Mike Sackton (DM): That heads?
[01:41:58.76 - 01:42:01.78] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): 4… 9.
[01:42:02.02 - 01:42:04.70] Mike Sackton (DM): 9, you… which one are you shooting at? The close one.
[01:42:04.70 - 01:42:06.78] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): The one… the close one.
[01:42:07.51 - 01:42:30.06] Mike Sackton (DM): It is dead. the last… Wisp. It doesn't seem to be concerned that everybody else is gone, and it just… tries to… Shoot. A needle gusts at whoever's nearest, which in this case is justice.
[01:42:34.68 - 01:42:36.46] unknown_speaker: But it goes wide.
[01:42:40.97 - 01:42:46.66] Mike Sackton (DM): And Echo didn't kill, I mean… Somebody just killed it, the last thing.
[01:42:47.88 - 01:42:49.46] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Yeah. Echo kills the last thing.
[01:42:49.46 - 01:42:50.81] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Echo kills it. End it.
[01:42:50.81 - 01:42:52.60] Mike Sackton (DM): Echo kills the last thing.
[01:42:55.51 - 01:42:56.40] unknown_speaker: ads…
[01:42:56.79 - 01:42:57.32] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[01:43:00.83 - 01:43:04.81] unknown_speaker: The triumphant music plays, and Elo's had, and Yellow's had.
[01:43:04.96 - 01:43:07.52] Mike Sackton (DM): Something soundtrack in the background there.
[01:43:10.90 - 01:43:15.45] unknown_speaker: as… Everything, it seems…
[01:43:18.23 - 01:43:23.06] Mike Sackton (DM): The danger seems to be gone.
[01:43:26.38 - 01:43:27.27] Mike Sackton (DM): As you all.
[01:43:27.27 - 01:43:30.27] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Arrows from where the wolf body disintegrated.
[01:43:30.90 - 01:43:33.21] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, how many years did you… you can recover, like.
[01:43:34.56 - 01:43:35.78] Tim Sackton (Finnan): used for.
[01:43:36.52 - 01:43:42.18] Mike Sackton (DM): You can recover, actually, you can recover… All of them. It's pretty easy to recover them.
--- Kalima's Story ---
[01:43:43.29 - 01:43:49.59] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): YOLO looks around and says, well. Thank goodness I was here. My name is Yolo.
[01:43:52.05 - 01:43:56.09] David Kong (Ekko): You already said that. You already introduced yourself earlier.
[01:43:56.91 - 01:43:58.66] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, well…
[01:43:58.66 - 01:44:03.95] David Kong (Ekko): You don't have to save your name twice, and live once, you can just save your name once. And live once.
[01:44:04.98 - 01:44:15.16] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Finn and Finn and… there's still two Finnans, walks over, and both Finns give YOLO a little bow. com… And he says.
[01:44:18.61 - 01:44:20.44] Tim Sackton (Finnan): That was good shooting.
[01:44:23.00 - 01:44:25.92] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Thank you. Looks like you did some good work yourself.
[01:44:29.04 - 01:44:34.13] Tim Sackton (Finnan): no, we'll see. I… I was caught a little unprepared there.
[01:44:35.14 - 01:44:36.00] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah, don't.
[01:44:36.00 - 01:44:37.40] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna laugh, though.
[01:44:39.31 - 01:44:40.71] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, yeah, how's she doing?
[01:44:41.09 - 01:44:43.43] unknown_speaker: She's… so she's currently, like.
[01:44:43.43 - 01:44:47.90] Mike Sackton (DM): Kinda cowered on the ground, like, huddled in a little ball, like…
[01:44:48.17 - 01:44:48.81] unknown_speaker: Ow.
[01:44:48.81 - 01:44:57.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Oh, you healed her, so she's not dead or anything. But she's like… Actually, is the combo motion still… you didn't…
[01:44:57.66 - 01:45:02.04] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Never lost concentration, it lasts for a minute, so… Okay.
[01:45:02.04 - 01:45:22.26] Mike Sackton (DM): It has another 30 seconds or so. That was only 3 rounds of combat. So she's kind of looking around, like. She kind of slowly looks up, clearly the calm of motion is still… calming her. But she… she still looks… really… uncertain.
[01:45:22.36 - 01:46:01.85] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I, I will… I will say to YOLO and, like, nod. Kind of at the polar bear, I would love to speak more, but I am afraid when this spell ends. this woman is going to be terrified, and I think we must get whatever we can out of her in these 30 seconds we have. And so I will turn back to her and say, in Old Zenkoven. What is this place? Why are you so afraid? In my best, sort of, calming, like… You know, getting stories out of people's voices.
[01:46:02.21 - 01:46:03.52] unknown_speaker: Okay.
[01:46:03.61 - 01:46:06.20] Mike Sackton (DM): Make a charisma check with proficiency.
[01:46:13.79 - 01:46:26.91] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Sorry, I just made the, Okay, I'm debating… no, I don't need to use luck on this, that's fine. 14 plus 3, so…
[01:46:27.04 - 01:46:29.25] unknown_speaker: plus charisma, so 21.
[01:46:29.92 - 01:46:53.96] Mike Sackton (DM): So, she kinda looks up. And only, only… she's talking in this ancient language that nobody understands except Finian and justice, but, she kind of… Looks up at you a little bit, like… like… puzzled. And says, sorry, remind me what you asked her?
[01:46:55.23 - 01:47:00.52] Tim Sackton (Finnan): what is this place? Why are you still afraid? But the basic question is just, like, tell me your story.
[01:47:01.35 - 01:47:01.84] Mike Sackton (DM): Right.
[01:47:01.84 - 01:47:02.24] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[01:47:02.24 - 01:47:05.06] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Why are you here? What happened?
[01:47:05.06 - 01:47:07.88] Mike Sackton (DM): She… she walks around at this…
[01:47:08.06 - 01:47:09.80] unknown_speaker: at this place.
[01:47:09.89 - 01:47:38.61] Mike Sackton (DM): And the ice bridges, and… you can see, like, just this sinking… Sensation in her eyes, like… Like, sort of… just… just almost a life draining out of her. She's not terrified, she's clearly underselling her reaction, but she says. I'm… back. nobody…
[01:47:39.18 - 01:47:41.13] unknown_speaker: Nobody escapes.
[01:47:42.65 - 01:47:47.31] Mike Sackton (DM): And yet, Somehow I did. And now I'm back?
[01:47:50.36 - 01:47:51.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Back where?
[01:47:53.48 - 01:47:56.63] unknown_speaker: She sort of points around, and she says.
[01:47:57.22 - 01:48:14.39] Mike Sackton (DM): Zephyr is home… Zephy… What's the… what's the name? Ziphers! Zifa's Labyrinth. You do not know? You speak our tongue, yet you don't know the stories?
[01:48:16.01 - 01:48:23.54] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I assume I know several… many stories about Zagbutt's Labyrinth, unless they're completely lost, okay.
[01:48:23.54 - 01:48:25.37] Mike Sackton (DM): I've never heard of Cyphus.
[01:48:25.37 - 01:48:51.42] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna fake it and say… of course I know the stories, and I'm gonna just try to take my fiddle and just pluck on it a little bit, just, like, starting to sort of improvise a little bit of a tune. And I'm gonna tell her, but I'm… I'm here to… I've come here to write down the songs. And yours specifically are ones I have not heard.
[01:48:53.78 - 01:48:58.11] Mike Sackton (DM): Mike, is this safe for the West Wind? Yeah. The cruel west wind.
[01:48:59.29 - 01:49:05.93] David Schwartz (Justas): I'll say that in, is Old Zenkoven a spoken language still? Yeah. Like, people still talk about it?
[01:49:05.93 - 01:49:27.10] Mike Sackton (DM): So, like, way up in the mountains, like, in the foothills of the Sentinels, on the fringes of civilization, there's occasionally, like, little tribes. Remember the Braugaldi from… Dunbar, the people north of Ersk. The old Zimcovas are kind of related to them. They're not the same… they don't turn into animals in the same way and stuff like that, but…
[01:49:27.10 - 01:49:28.48] unknown_speaker: Very few.
[01:49:28.73 - 01:49:43.97] Mike Sackton (DM): Like, you would have met a few people here and there on your travels that spoke it, but nobody in Breva still speaks it. It's more of a lost language from the… from the local… Though it'd be surprising to see somebody speaking it. They're few and far between.
[01:49:44.83 - 01:49:56.86] David Schwartz (Justas): Let's just a… I'll chime in to say, over Finnen, Zifa the Cruel West Wind, I've… met many, many, many of the Gestavo in this land, but I've never known that Ziva had a home.
[01:50:00.12 - 01:50:03.77] unknown_speaker: So you would know, I mean, the story is that Sifa lives in the castle.
[01:50:03.91 - 01:50:05.10] Mike Sackton (DM): You've never totally believed.
[01:50:05.10 - 01:50:05.96] David Schwartz (Justas): Sorry, nevermind.
[01:50:06.23 - 01:50:07.98] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, you would, like…
[01:50:07.98 - 01:50:10.89] unknown_speaker: There's a… there's a myth, a legend, that.
[01:50:11.35 - 01:50:15.93] David Schwartz (Justas): Well, I'll say then, I never really believed that Sif Alif lived in the chasm.
[01:50:19.30 - 01:50:21.15] Mike Sackton (DM): The chasm? she says.
[01:50:23.95 - 01:50:25.00] David Schwartz (Justas): What year is it?
[01:50:26.56 - 01:50:31.26] Mike Sackton (DM): We don't… We don't count the years.
[01:50:31.44 - 01:50:34.69] unknown_speaker: It's been… 7…
[01:50:36.34 - 01:50:41.54] Mike Sackton (DM): Seven by seven by seven generations since we came to this land.
[01:50:44.24 - 01:50:45.91] unknown_speaker: Or so the grandfathers say.
[01:50:49.34 - 01:50:50.00] unknown_speaker: But…
[01:50:50.00 - 01:50:58.56] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'll… I'll try and riff off Justin a little and say, when she's talking about the grandfathers. And they must have stories and songs.
[01:51:00.53 - 01:51:02.24] Mike Sackton (DM): They tell the…
[01:51:02.35 - 01:51:17.55] unknown_speaker: They tell of a great… Cataclysm that changed the face of the Earth. And… Well… We… we hid from that cataclysm.
[01:51:19.47 - 01:51:26.98] Mike Sackton (DM): Many, many years ago, 7x7x7… I mean, you would probably recognize 7x7x7 is almost certainly just…
[01:51:26.98 - 01:51:27.57] David Schwartz (Justas): many.
[01:51:27.57 - 01:51:43.18] Mike Sackton (DM): Many, right? Like, they probably… it's not really 21 generations, right? A great cataclysm shook the earth. The swamp strained away. the… The seas changed.
[01:51:46.00 - 01:51:51.75] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So I'm… fucking a little bit on my fiddle as well, and trying to get her to just, like, keep…
[01:51:52.21 - 01:51:53.44] unknown_speaker: I'm sort of…
[01:51:53.53 - 01:51:57.96] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Turning this into a little bit of a song as she begins to talk.
[01:51:57.96 - 01:52:02.45] Mike Sackton (DM): And we came to this land to hide from the great cataclysm.
[01:52:02.49 - 01:52:03.74] unknown_speaker: But…
[01:52:04.42 - 01:52:21.88] Mike Sackton (DM): But Zifel is here waiting. We did not know. It was their home. And now… Now Zypha demands appeasement. With their labyrinth. No one escapes.
[01:52:26.52 - 01:52:28.22] David Schwartz (Justas): And yet, you got out once before.
[01:52:34.54 - 01:52:35.73] David Schwartz (Justas): Or seemed to.
[01:52:41.40 - 01:52:52.74] Mike Sackton (DM): She says, sorry, I'm sending Tim a little message. Yes, obviously. Okay. The… Yes.
[01:52:53.01 - 01:52:55.93] unknown_speaker: She sort of looks around all of a sudden and shrieks.
[01:52:56.67 - 01:52:59.67] Mike Sackton (DM): No, it starts just saying, no, no!
[01:52:59.67 - 01:53:00.47] unknown_speaker: I can't.
[01:53:01.58 - 01:53:07.54] Mike Sackton (DM): No, and it's, like, just, like, huddled, like, collapses in a ball, and it started just repeating.
[01:53:07.73 - 01:53:08.78] unknown_speaker: The Comb Emotions Act.
[01:53:09.77 - 01:53:10.44] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
-- The Beast, The Maze, The Kestavo ---
[01:53:13.10 - 01:53:16.00] Mike Sackton (DM): I… she started… she sort of…
[01:53:16.00 - 01:53:17.23] unknown_speaker: I…
[01:53:19.22 - 01:53:34.37] Mike Sackton (DM): I can't go in again. The only way out is in, and I can't go in again. No. And just, like, just, like, muttering, like, just, like, saying again and again in, in, in sort of terror.
[01:53:40.99 - 01:53:42.64] Mike Sackton (DM): The beast, she says.
[01:53:43.79 - 01:53:44.62] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Sorry, what?
[01:53:44.62 - 01:54:04.91] Mike Sackton (DM): She says, the beast. And sort of shakes her head. If you find the beast. It… it… she sort of looks at the… looks at the… the fallen, cracked ice. Maybe you… You could… you could kill it, maybe, but I… no. And… hides again, like, in a ball.
[01:54:11.21 - 01:54:25.76] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm still just trying to, you know. walking at my fiddle a little bit and just trying to get, like, a soothing vibe going, but I'm pretty pessimistic that that's going to… Too much, just not, like, totally ready to give up on her.
[01:54:28.76 - 01:54:45.64] unknown_speaker: Go ahead and roll… I don't know. I mean, yeah, you'd have proficiency in this, so sure, roll another charisma check. I can't understand a word of what's going on, but I've been with her for a while, so I'm just sort of sitting next to her reassuringly as I can.
[01:54:45.94 - 01:54:47.78] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So… 19?
[01:54:48.13 - 01:54:49.72] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Like a scared wild animal.
[01:54:56.16 - 01:55:06.13] Mike Sackton (DM): Kate, roll a… do you have… wait, does your background have any… you have, like, a wild animal. I forget what your narrative proficiencies are. What did you write down?
[01:55:06.13 - 01:55:08.70] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Diplomacy, bringing messages…
[01:55:09.87 - 01:55:10.91] Mike Sackton (DM): Anything about calming…
[01:55:10.91 - 01:55:11.46] Tim Sackton (Finnan): move.
[01:55:11.59 - 01:55:13.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Calming frightened people? Not really, right?
[01:55:13.66 - 01:55:15.25] Kate Sackton (Jrain): No, that was…
[01:55:15.25 - 01:55:15.80] Tim Sackton (Finnan): No.
[01:55:15.80 - 01:55:18.68] Kate Sackton (Jrain): It was not one, just connecting with animals.
[01:55:18.68 - 01:55:21.76] Mike Sackton (DM): Wolf. Nevermind, then. Damn.
[01:55:21.76 - 01:55:22.17] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Right.
[01:55:22.17 - 01:55:57.98] Mike Sackton (DM): So she… she seems, I mean, she's… she's, like, huddled in a heap, and seems completely unwilling to… like, Shola, you could certainly coax a few… She seems to have a connection with Finian. You could certainly coax maybe a few… a few small facts out of her, if there was specific questions and you, like, took a few minutes to, like, try and repeat the question and, like, calm her down, but she seems like… Like, just in complete despair and kind of huddled on the floor, like… Totally unsure of what to even do next.
[01:55:59.89 - 01:56:09.54] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So, I am going to… Just leave her… She's huddled in a… in a… like, crouched down, right?
[01:56:09.54 - 01:56:12.94] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's, like, curled up around herself, like, hugging.
[01:56:12.94 - 01:56:56.43] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I will just gently tell her that she's… You know, she's safe for now, and… I will use Minor Illusion to create on top of her a… An image of… Like, the inside of… whatever I can, like, think of as a, you know, a house of… Maybe whatever the, like. cottage in the… in the sort of far north looked like, but it's only 5 feet, so this is basically sitting in front of a hearth with 5 feet of light, and then it's all sort of darkness around. Just to try and give her a safe place so that we can talk.
[01:56:56.82 - 01:56:57.20] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:56:58.16 - 01:56:58.59] David Schwartz (Justas): I think I'll.
[01:56:58.59 - 01:57:06.85] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And I'll just keep that going, just, like, plucking on my fiddle to keep the illusion going, so recasting the cantrip every minute.
[01:57:07.09 - 01:57:08.31] unknown_speaker: Try swing, are you gonna say?
[01:57:08.31 - 01:57:26.02] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah, I'll go looking among, like, all the different, like, charms and relics and symbols of the Kestavo that I've accumulated over the years for something from the high mountains, like, something that I might guess at her being familiar with based on, sort of, dress and speech and… Anything short?
[01:57:26.02 - 01:57:26.38] Mike Sackton (DM): Church.
[01:57:26.38 - 01:57:27.54] David Schwartz (Justas): But where she's from.
[01:57:27.75 - 01:57:47.44] Mike Sackton (DM): There's a… there's a famous, well-known Kestavo called Rommel, the Glacier King, who is supposed to live on the highest peak of the Sentinels, but is also supposed to have a very ancient provenance, and, like, is the old, you know, is… Was here when the people first came, kind of thing.
[01:57:47.44 - 01:58:07.61] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah, I'll find, like, deep, sort of in the bottom of a pocket, there's, it's a piece of, sea glass that's blue, like, different shades of blue, that looks like a piece of glacial ice that's a symbol for him, and I'll put it in her hands. Say a few words over it.
[01:58:08.15 - 01:58:16.65] Mike Sackton (DM): She kind of clutches it gratefully for a moment, and then kind of looks at you and says. There are no Kestavo here.
[01:58:21.49 - 01:58:23.35] David Schwartz (Justas): Well, we'll find our way back then.
[01:58:23.81 - 01:58:34.30] Mike Sackton (DM): I can't… I mean, you actually know this is not true. You at least have enough connection to them to cast your magic, but she says, they cannot… they cannot hear our prayers here. We are too far away.
[01:58:38.84 - 01:58:39.96] unknown_speaker: I'll say…
[01:58:41.22 - 01:58:45.93] David Schwartz (Justas): I think we may not be too far, and I'll cast light on that little relic thing.
[01:58:45.93 - 01:58:46.91] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[01:58:46.91 - 01:58:54.29] David Schwartz (Justas): Glows in her hands and say it's… The Glacier King. Whose power makes this shine.
[01:58:54.35 - 01:58:55.26] unknown_speaker: Even here.
[01:58:56.30 - 01:59:45.42] Mike Sackton (DM): She kind of clutches it pretty gratefully, like, clutching it close to her and kind of looking at the hearth and is, like, singing a little lullaby to herself, which you've never heard before. It's… it's clearly… not related, doesn't sound related to any of the songs you've collected, right? Like, it seems like a totally different style of vocal arrangement, right? Like, you would actually… Finian's sense would be it's not even a clear derivative, like, it's clearly very different, right? And it's sort of, like, calming down a little bit, but is still, like, pretty… despairing about her future. But again, you could probably coax a few questions out of her if you had specific questions you wanted to ask.
[01:59:47.76 - 02:00:04.00] Tim Sackton (Finnan): At this point, though, I think I will turn. For the rest of the group. And… start to tell the story. Oh, perfect, Kong's back. Kong. Are you still a polar bear?
[02:00:09.64 - 02:00:12.34] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I guess you can understand us if you're a polar bear.
[02:00:12.94 - 02:00:15.41] David Kong (Ekko): I'll hang out to polar bears still, why not?
[02:00:16.02 - 02:00:55.95] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So… so I'm… Finn and Justice have just been talking to the woman, and now she is… Slightly calm. And Finan will turn to the group. And, changes the tune on his fiddlest lady, and will begin to tell a story. of… The land as it used to be. back when the Oaks Dreads first… traveled the Green Sea, and I'll stop, and I'll say that Duplicate has disappeared now, I'll say. I'm sorry we weren't properly introduced before. I'm Finnan Oakstride.
[02:01:00.30 - 02:01:28.41] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I am… Quite interested to hear your stories. But let me tell you a story first, what I think we learned from this woman, and I'll begin to tell the tale of A long time ago, like, a couple thousand years ago. Before the big empire in the South, Drancor even existed. All this… most of this land was… swamps.
[02:01:28.61 - 02:01:33.72] unknown_speaker: There was a great lizardfolk empire, and that's, in his family legend, anyway, that's when the first.
[02:01:33.72 - 02:02:28.66] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oak Strides. came to the Green Sea. And where is not remembered, or at least he is not willing to tell you. And he says, I think this woman, which she seems to be saying is her people. fled the Great War. ago, not the Great War that we call the Great War, but the Great War that's now Kind of forgotten from many of the stories. The Great War, at the end of which… Land changed, and the swamps dried out, and the lizardfolk sweat, and… I guess the mountains maybe shifted. The myths are confused on this point, exactly what happened.
[02:02:28.75 - 02:02:31.08] unknown_speaker: But maybe it was when the chasm…
[02:02:31.08 - 02:02:37.90] Tim Sackton (Finnan): came to be. We don't know. But she says her people…
[02:02:37.98 - 02:02:40.10] unknown_speaker: Hid here from that war.
[02:02:42.03 - 02:02:48.17] Tim Sackton (Finnan): generations and generations ago. And the only way out is through some kind of maze.
[02:02:52.90 - 02:03:04.89] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So, and he gives another short little strum on his fiddle, sort of a dramatic ending. I guess it's a story for how to meet somebody. It's hard to top that.
[02:03:06.71 - 02:03:09.20] David Kong (Ekko): Wait, so are you saying she's thousands of years old?
[02:03:11.32 - 02:03:12.16] Mike Sackton (DM): Twitter.
[02:03:12.16 - 02:03:14.94] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Well, her people have been here thousands of years.
[02:03:16.20 - 02:03:30.23] Mike Sackton (DM): She said, like, Herb. The, you know, grandfather's grandfather's 7x7 generations came in here ages ago, not implying that she was that old. Right. There's some people, she's… she's talking about some people.
[02:03:30.61 - 02:03:33.22] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Finan's interpreting this as… yeah.
[02:03:33.70 - 02:03:39.74] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean, Kong, Echo has never heard of any humans living in the chasm.
[02:03:40.19 - 02:03:41.14] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, this is weird.
[02:03:41.30 - 02:03:51.17] Mike Sackton (DM): Totally weird, super weird. Like, you've never heard of any such thing as humans living in the chasm. But she seems to be implying she lives here, or near here.
[02:03:51.68 - 02:04:01.02] David Kong (Ekko): Okay, so this is all great, and… Sorry, my Zoom… Is my internet… was I freezing?
[02:04:01.36 - 02:04:03.00] Mike Sackton (DM): You froze a little bit, yeah.

[02:04:03.00 - 02:04:09.76] David Kong (Ekko): So apologies for my friend here for, both starting and ending that.
[02:04:09.87 - 02:04:10.52] unknown_speaker: That's.
[02:04:10.52 - 02:04:11.80] David Kong (Ekko): battle, but .
[02:04:11.80 - 02:04:12.44] unknown_speaker: Who?
[02:04:12.44 - 02:04:24.33] David Kong (Ekko): Who, who are you all? What… what is going on here? What are… what's, what is… what is this? What is this place? Where… where… where… who are, who are all of you? Why are you here?
[02:04:25.60 - 02:04:31.40] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Do I? Recognize him? Do I know that there are… Okay. But I know…
[02:04:31.40 - 02:04:42.87] Mike Sackton (DM): You know the Kenku, right? You know… you know… you've been to the Kameku Monastery plenty of times, you recognize Kenku, right? You just have never met either of these two Kenku specifically.
[02:04:45.30 - 02:05:07.35] Kate Sackton (Jrain): You're giving the impression that you're one of the Kenku from Kameka. I'm not sure. If we've ever met, but I've… Been called here to… help, find someone who could talk to this woman. She crawled out of the chasm recently in all of this craziness. And nobody could understand her.
[02:05:07.77 - 02:05:08.33] David Kong (Ekko): So…
[02:05:08.33 - 02:05:10.70] Kate Sackton (Jrain): So, justice and…
[02:05:10.89 - 02:05:12.96] David Kong (Ekko): Go ahead, sorry.
[02:05:13.41 - 02:05:32.38] Kate Sackton (Jrain): So, Justice and Finn… We're called to come and talk to her. We weren't here when the magic storm brought us here, but… We were coming to… they were coming specifically to talk to her and find out her story. Because she seems to have come out of the chasm.
[02:05:32.38 - 02:05:33.39] David Kong (Ekko): But who are you?
[02:05:34.87 - 02:05:52.82] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I'm just a local messenger. I… I've been, fighting most recently against the orcs and coordinating the battles that have Been cleaning up after. All of that, ravager. Mess.
[02:05:54.17 - 02:05:55.13] David Kong (Ekko): What do you know of the monastery?
[02:05:59.68 - 02:06:16.14] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I'm not a frequent visitor, I've just… Noah… no, it's a place where, people… your… Your, group lives. I know very little about what you do.
[02:06:18.78 - 02:06:19.65] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[02:06:19.65 - 02:06:20.88] unknown_speaker: That's where I'm headed.
[02:06:22.84 - 02:06:25.90] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): But, does anyone know where we are now?
[02:06:30.19 - 02:06:31.46] David Schwartz (Justas): No.
[02:06:31.46 - 02:06:34.49] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I suspect… In the chasm.
[02:06:36.32 - 02:06:37.31] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): to change.
[02:06:38.17 - 02:06:39.44] David Kong (Ekko): Maybe.
[02:06:39.44 - 02:06:46.07] David Schwartz (Justas): Although, the old woman also said we're in the West Winds Labyrinth right now, which maybe is in the chasm?
[02:06:48.20 - 02:06:49.51] Mike Sackton (DM): Mike, can you change the music?
[02:06:49.51 - 02:06:54.13] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah, that's not the best playlist for this. That's like, you know, sitting around camp music.
[02:06:54.13 - 02:06:59.76] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, no, it got… sorry, I… I had a combat playlist, but then it got away from me, let me put so…
[02:06:59.76 - 02:07:05.09] David Kong (Ekko): No, you're good, you're good, you're good. The music actually was fine, it was just the, the, the harmonizing,
[02:07:05.09 - 02:07:06.92] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:06.92 - 02:07:54.00] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah. Yes. So… I don't know any of you or your history with the Chasm, but I've… Chasm is… is… both. A home and a place to be. Very, very… Aware of, and alert of, too. Echo will have a look up at the… Echo will kind of, in a jump, he'll, like… he's still a bear, a bear, has been sitting there, kind of like, you know. Licking his paws and just kinda, you know, scratching himself. It's sort of like, this is so much better as a bear.
[02:07:54.57 - 02:07:55.28] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That is…
[02:07:55.63 - 02:08:18.34] David Kong (Ekko): And then, he, he, he jumps up, and, like, again, like, does this kind of, like, barrel flip, and then turns into a, into a, back into a Kenku. And, Tim, you're… so this… or sorry, huh, reflex. Mike, so this, the sky, like, you know how you said the sky is all white? Is it, like, like, white as far as the eye-can-see, like, end-to-end type of thing? Like, what's the.
[02:08:18.34 - 02:08:20.84] Mike Sackton (DM): Wow, it's dark, so you can really…
[02:08:20.84 - 02:08:21.42] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): our kids.
[02:08:21.42 - 02:08:45.91] Mike Sackton (DM): it's real dark, right? So you can really only see the, like, 40 feet ahead… like, the area right above you, where the… the white spell is, right? But what you see when you look straight up is a dense snowstorm. Right? Like, it looks like the storm you fell through. Like, really intense winds, strong… strong…
[02:08:45.91 - 02:08:56.66] David Kong (Ekko): I'm gonna ask… I'm gonna ask you a spiritual question. So, you know, again, this is… does… For… from all of Echo's intuition, are we inside the chasm right now?
[02:08:59.79 - 02:09:00.26] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[02:09:01.60 - 02:09:03.17] Mike Sackton (DM): Echo!
[02:09:04.28 - 02:09:06.15] David Kong (Ekko): Chevron, can I check or something?
[02:09:08.61 - 02:09:22.67] Mike Sackton (DM): Sure, roll of wisdom. Roll wisdom. Add your proficiency. Well, say one of your, background proficiencies is, is, is… one of your narrative proficiencies is… The War of the chasm.
[02:09:23.13 - 02:09:25.79] David Kong (Ekko): Alright, so I'm just rolling Wisdom… is it plus 4?
[02:09:25.79 - 02:09:29.52] Mike Sackton (DM): Wisdom plus… roll your wisdom, which is plus… roll a D20 and add 7.
[02:09:29.74 - 02:09:31.99] David Kong (Ekko): Okay. Oh, at 7.
[02:09:31.99 - 02:10:02.22] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, I rolled… well, I rolled an 18, so plus 7 is 25. Echo feels… You can't explain why. But you feel like something's wrong with this place. It doesn't… it doesn't… feel like the chasm. It doesn't feel like wet, like, the biggest thing you can point to is looking up at the sky. It doesn't feel like weather, it doesn't really look like a sky. Okay. Right? It actually looks more like a spell. Okay. When you look at it, right? And it just… it bothers you. You can't put it together.
[02:10:02.22 - 02:10:06.44] David Kong (Ekko): So, it actually doesn't necessarily feel like… we could not be in the chasm.
[02:10:06.44 - 02:10:11.47] Mike Sackton (DM): you could potentially not be… I mean, you can't really explain how you would fall into the chasm and then not be in the chasm.
[02:10:12.17 - 02:10:43.49] David Kong (Ekko): Got it, perfect, perfect. Yeah, so Echo, Echo, like, you know, flips, flips into a bird, hovers there for a second, is kind of, like, looking around, is like. I know this place well, and when I say this place, I mean the chasm. It's hard to explain, but… Everything… I'm guessing all of us would guess, would be that we fell in here. I know Echo and I, or Yolo and I certainly fell in here, but… Wherever the here is, I don't think we're in the chasm.
[02:10:44.65 - 02:10:46.68] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Steve, you see my message?
[02:10:48.89 - 02:11:32.76] Kate Sackton (Jrain): For us, it didn't feel like falling. We were outside at the camp just north of the chasm. And a big storm hit, and just… could have whisked us up into the sky, as far as we know, or off to a distant mountain. Like, it just transported us, it didn't really feel like falling. Into the chasm. But I thought, since she said. she was back here with… I assume you conveyed that general language. In your storytelling. Fit in? Yes. Since she said she was back here, and my knowledge of where she was most recently is in the chasm, and she crawled out. That we must be in the chasm.
[02:11:33.89 - 02:11:34.82] David Kong (Ekko): I don't… I'm not…
[02:11:34.82 - 02:11:35.41] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Dune.
[02:11:35.41 - 02:11:36.04] David Kong (Ekko): Chasm.
[02:11:37.85 - 02:12:00.94] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Well, maybe she wasn't either, but she somehow got from wherever this is to the chasm, and managed to crawl out of the chasm. which is what I want to learn how to do, because I'm very worried about the Beko Vahai party, Adrikas and Pecrynic, who… Did disappear in here.
[02:12:01.42 - 02:12:04.50] Mike Sackton (DM): And Drikas, by the way, is a name you… that's your mentor.
[02:12:04.50 - 02:12:07.40] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, you know Rodriguez?
[02:12:09.06 - 02:12:21.14] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Yes, I was sending birds to watch their progress as they… ventured into the chasm to try to figure out what was wrong, and so when the giant cloud of steam…
[02:12:21.44 - 02:12:25.55] David Kong (Ekko): Sending birds? Like, are you talking about us, or what are you, what are you…
[02:12:25.55 - 02:12:25.96] unknown_speaker: What kind of.
[02:12:26.31 - 02:12:30.10] Kate Sackton (Jrain): No, not… not, kenku. Little birds.
[02:12:30.87 - 02:12:31.27] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Don't call me.
[02:12:31.27 - 02:12:37.12] David Kong (Ekko): I mean, you just referred to us as that group earlier, and now you're talking about… anyways, it's fine, don't worry about it.
[02:12:37.12 - 02:12:42.14] Mike Sackton (DM): Somebody has to be racist to somebody in every game we play.
[02:12:42.52 - 02:12:45.98] David Kong (Ekko): She called us the group. I don't know what group she's referring to.
[02:12:47.58 - 02:12:51.13] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Do I know that you're a religious group? The monks, or what?
[02:12:51.13 - 02:13:05.17] Mike Sackton (DM): No, you, you know the… you… you actually would have known, you know the, the Vehovaca as well. You wouldn't, you wouldn't, you wouldn't, you'd be… there are no, as far as you know, there are no Kenku who are part of the Vehovaca. Bate.
[02:13:05.46 - 02:13:08.50] unknown_speaker: I assume that the Kenko are a part of the Kameko Monastery.
[02:13:08.55 - 02:13:10.90] Mike Sackton (DM): But the Mystic group is not unknown to you.
[02:13:12.98 - 02:13:24.39] Kate Sackton (Jrain): So, I think that… I assumed that you were part of the Comeco and their religious practices. If you know, pocrinic… then…
[02:13:24.99 - 02:13:25.58] David Kong (Ekko): I don't know.
[02:13:25.58 - 02:13:26.27] Kate Sackton (Jrain): or…
[02:13:26.59 - 02:13:27.15] David Kong (Ekko): assume a lot.
[02:13:33.42 - 02:13:37.70] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Well, I'm worried about them, because I last saw them in danger.
[02:13:38.06 - 02:13:40.39] David Kong (Ekko): You know, you know, Adrikas?
[02:13:42.09 - 02:14:38.86] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Adrikas was being accompanied by Pakrynnek. And all of the Veho vacai We're hoping that they were their best chance as a party to figure out what was going on down here. But we needed to follow their adventures. to… keep communication flowing. And as a messenger. I do that by talking to Birds who would normally be without speech, but with whom I can… Bond and communicate. And so, those… messengers. Go back and forth. I also have a close friend, Rala, who… I hope… will come back to me in… in the morning. Who can take the shape of a bird and… and voyage. So…
[02:14:39.61 - 02:14:41.50] David Kong (Ekko): What needs to have of the group?
[02:14:44.49 - 02:15:09.60] Kate Sackton (Jrain): the last that I saw of them, there was a horrible hot storm of… painfully hot mist that… that killed my friend Rolla. And… I hope that those with arts and skills evaded its… Fiery… not fiery, hot.
[02:15:09.60 - 02:15:12.28] unknown_speaker: Smoky, steamy. F.
[02:15:12.28 - 02:15:15.50] Kate Sackton (Jrain): effects. But I don't know, and I am worried.
[02:15:16.49 - 02:15:17.41] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm…
[02:15:19.95 - 02:15:21.07] David Kong (Ekko): I share your worry.
[02:15:24.40 - 02:15:29.05] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): The storms here are coming. Different flavors. You know, strange.
[02:15:31.93 - 02:15:36.16] Kate Sackton (Jrain): is steam… Shards of rainbows.
[02:15:37.36 - 02:15:38.51] David Kong (Ekko): What have you, Large Man?
[02:15:45.64 - 02:15:50.95] David Schwartz (Justas): What of me? My… my story, or my thoughts on… Where we are and where to go.
[02:15:51.78 - 02:15:52.73] David Kong (Ekko): Why are you here?
[02:15:54.16 - 02:15:59.73] David Schwartz (Justas): Well, I was traveling with the halfling. We were coming because we'd heard of her come out of the chasm.
[02:16:00.70 - 02:16:01.84] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I'm one of the…
[02:16:01.84 - 02:16:08.35] David Schwartz (Justas): Keepers of the Kestavo's houses, the spirits who live in this land all over.
[02:16:08.35 - 02:16:10.92] David Kong (Ekko): Mike, what are the custavas houses? Did I know about those?
[02:16:10.92 - 02:16:57.10] Mike Sackton (DM): So you would know, but yeah, so the cassavo are the local religion. It's basically a sort of small gods tradition, where the idea is that there's, like, a god in every… a little god in a brook, or in a tree, or in a mountain, or in a… in a… waterfall, or… and so… and people sort of build little shrines to the different small gods in these different little places, and worship them, and it's kind of the… it's faded a bit, because the Mas Numina, like, the Eight Divines religion, has kind of come up from Sambara, and is… A more powerful set of gods, and so it's not as widespread as it was, but… They would… you would know. I mean, it's the local religion. You would think of it kind of like, sort of… Shinto, Japanese… With God.
[02:16:57.36 - 02:16:58.50] David Kong (Ekko): Sounds very shitty, yeah.
[02:16:58.87 - 02:16:59.47] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah.
[02:16:59.84 - 02:17:04.30] David Kong (Ekko): What's the relationship between those and the Mystics? Is it, like, mutual?
[02:17:04.62 - 02:18:15.54] Mike Sackton (DM): I think… I think, I think they… I think they are friend… like, I think a lot of the mystics might see the Chasm as kind of, related to the Gestavo in a way, right? Like, some of them probably even believe that Kestavo… one of the vibes of the mystics is that… one of the stories in the local area is that Sophia, this evil spirit, the cruel west wind who has to be appeased. To keep from stealing your crops and your children, and so on, right? is… lives in the chasm. But the… and so some of the Gestavo worshippers actually believe that, and are very negative. And the Vahio, the Feja Vaikai are anti that. They're like, no, the chasm is part of the world that has these… this elemental balance to it. But probably some of your compatriot mystics would believe that actually there are custod, like, there are religious… gods, who are… pro-human, like, you know, not this kind of evil, cruel West Wind who live in the chasm. Others might think it's unrelated to the gods, but it's either… either friendly or neutral. Not… there's no conflict between the mystics.
[02:18:15.55 - 02:18:29.50] David Kong (Ekko): I see, I see, okay. Okay. Yeah. Echo, Echo, like, like, relaxes a bit. It's like… Kestavo, haven't seen… seen you around here. In a bit, one of you here.
[02:18:32.62 - 02:18:36.71] David Schwartz (Justas): No, I don't… I've never been to the monastery itself, though I've met.
[02:18:36.71 - 02:18:38.60] unknown_speaker: More than a handful of…
[02:18:38.97 - 02:18:40.95] David Schwartz (Justas): Kenku trained there over the years?
[02:18:44.48 - 02:18:45.62] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): What are they like?
[02:18:49.17 - 02:18:50.06] David Schwartz (Justas): Thoughtful.
[02:18:51.59 - 02:18:58.35] Mike Sackton (DM): Although, remember, like, come back at the monastery, the Cancun monastery is, like, The battle-hardened, like…
[02:18:58.95 - 02:19:01.52] David Kong (Ekko): Monastery is a weird word to use for that.
[02:19:01.52 - 02:19:04.30] Mike Sackton (DM): It's a weird word, right? It's not really a monastery, right? It's like a…
[02:19:04.61 - 02:19:05.17] David Kong (Ekko): It's a trip.
[02:19:05.17 - 02:19:08.70] Mike Sackton (DM): It's a, it's like a… it's like a, it's like a barracks.
[02:19:08.70 - 02:19:10.66] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[02:19:10.66 - 02:19:37.34] Mike Sackton (DM): It's really like the… so… so, the Veho Vaika, the mystics that Echo is part of, don't live in the monastery, right? Kameko, you guys live, like, away a bit from the chasm. You come to the chasm, but you don't live, like, on… it's, like, too sacred of a space to live, like, on its shore, right? On its edge. You, like, live a little downstream. The monastery is, like, a Kenku barracks.
[02:19:37.34 - 02:19:37.98] David Kong (Ekko): where they.
[02:19:37.98 - 02:19:50.67] Mike Sackton (DM): They, like, train in aerial fighting in the chasm to be, like, to keep alive the deadly arts that Eren taught the Kenku in the Great War, because you have to keep alive the deadly arts.
[02:19:51.72 - 02:20:01.85] Kate Sackton (Jrain): But they do that in a chasm so not everybody knows it, so do we think they're just a bunch of peaceful birds who… excuse me… Oh, oh!
[02:20:01.85 - 02:20:03.15] David Kong (Ekko): Bunch of birds!
[02:20:03.15 - 02:20:10.02] Mike Sackton (DM): It's possible that some… some people… I mean, the Comeco are… they're… they're… Got that one for you.
[02:20:10.02 - 02:20:11.54] David Schwartz (Justas): Hashtag not all humans.
[02:20:15.68 - 02:20:17.51] David Kong (Ekko): I'm gonna huff up my feathers now.
[02:20:17.82 - 02:20:19.27] Mike Sackton (DM): Now, that…
[02:20:19.27 - 02:20:20.91] David Kong (Ekko): My feathers all up in a huff.
[02:20:21.67 - 02:20:42.91] Mike Sackton (DM): The Comeco is, like… they're very… they're fairly secretive, right? They would probably… there'd be all kinds of stories about what they really are. You would know, you've been there. Like, like, and listen, Kenzo. Echo, like, grew up there. You know they're, like, a battle-hearted group of warriors. You don't really care about the chasm, other than… it's a place to train, right?
[02:20:42.91 - 02:20:47.93] David Kong (Ekko): It's a sweet place to train. Yeah, that's like… that's like their… that's like the hashtag, a sweet place to train.
[02:20:47.93 - 02:20:48.35] Mike Sackton (DM): Exactly.
[02:20:49.17 - 02:21:01.19] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Whereas my impression is that they're some sort of… religious group, because they live in the chasm away from everybody else. So I've been calling them monks and, like, not knowing what they do, because it's mysterious.
[02:21:01.19 - 02:21:10.90] David Kong (Ekko): Echoed the whole time is like, humans are weird. You think that they're religious, and you think they're thoughtful? This is a very strange group of humans.
[02:21:11.68 - 02:21:16.03] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Clearly, we've never met the Kenku of… that…
[02:21:17.75 - 02:21:25.82] David Schwartz (Justas): barracks. Thoughtful in the sense of not being rash. Not… they're not impulsive, like…
[02:21:26.49 - 02:21:29.45] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, that's true. Yeah, no, I don't think they're impulsive.
[02:21:29.45 - 02:21:37.51] David Schwartz (Justas): Warriors aren't gonna, like, rush into… like, that sort of discipline is not to be fucked with, but, like, they're not gonna go out seeking people to fuck with.
[02:21:38.72 - 02:21:49.10] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, I think, I think they're very disciplined. I think they're, like, they're almost more like, they're like, you know, they drill, they, like, have just, you know, they're, they're, they're keeping a, you know, they're definitely.
[02:21:49.10 - 02:21:51.77] David Schwartz (Justas): Justice will amend it. Disciplined is a better word.
[02:21:52.01 - 02:21:53.81] David Kong (Ekko): Discipline, that is very good, yeah.
[02:21:53.81 - 02:21:55.85] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Like… like me.
[02:21:55.85 - 02:21:56.44] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yes.
[02:21:56.44 - 02:21:57.40] Mike Sackton (DM): Not, not like me.
[02:21:57.84 - 02:22:05.07] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So, how did you end up in here? Looking at the polar bear.
[02:22:05.94 - 02:22:07.88] David Kong (Ekko): I'm not a bird. I flipped up.
[02:22:07.88 - 02:22:11.55] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, okay, looking at the… Echo.
[02:22:13.26 - 02:22:22.85] David Kong (Ekko): Well, Well, wherever here is, I'm not sure where here is totally, but we'll get to that in a moment, but…
[02:22:22.85 - 02:22:23.69] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:22:23.69 - 02:22:41.91] David Kong (Ekko): The, the chasm, I… The short version of the story is that I lived at the monastery. I was born, and I lived in the monastery, and know it well, but Well, this wasn't quite for me, so… What's the name of the Mystics again, Mike?
[02:22:41.91 - 02:22:43.69] Mike Sackton (DM): the Veho Vaikai?
[02:22:45.37 - 02:22:46.77] David Kong (Ekko): You know of the veil of Ichai.
[02:22:47.02 - 02:22:50.33] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I assume I would, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not…
[02:22:50.33 - 02:22:51.46] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Everybody knows them.
[02:22:51.75 - 02:22:52.37] Mike Sackton (DM): They're not.
[02:22:52.37 - 02:22:53.42] Kate Sackton (Jrain): secretive.
[02:22:53.42 - 02:22:55.27] Mike Sackton (DM): Well, they're a little secretive.
[02:22:55.27 - 02:22:55.97] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah.
[02:22:55.97 - 02:22:57.25] Mike Sackton (DM): They're not really a little secretive.
[02:22:57.25 - 02:22:58.26] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah. Right?
[02:22:58.26 - 02:22:59.85] Mike Sackton (DM): But…
[02:22:59.85 - 02:23:00.77] Tim Sackton (Finnan): print some tails.
[02:23:00.77 - 02:23:01.37] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah.
[02:23:02.83 - 02:23:20.84] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, I… I… I live… I live amongst them, with them, and they've… It's home there. It's home there with them. Humans I trust. They're not looking at as bad. And.
[02:23:20.84 - 02:23:24.95] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I guess I was more curious what brought you to this place now.
[02:23:25.66 - 02:23:56.18] David Kong (Ekko): Oh, yeah, that's just more, Trying to help my friend here. We were trying to… we were headed to the monastery, and then… Got hit by that storm. I mean, there's all kinds of strange weather here you need to be prepared for and ready for, but… Whatever that was, was… Whatever the normal level of unusual and chaos is related to the chasm, that definitely was… more unusual. But we were just on our way to the monastery.
[02:23:56.84 - 02:24:01.03] Tim Sackton (Finnan): And you were also caught in a storm, which you couldn't see through?
[02:24:01.30 - 02:24:04.53] David Kong (Ekko): That's right. Same, same for yourself?
[02:24:06.15 - 02:24:39.46] Tim Sackton (Finnan): We were about to speak to this woman, and Finnan nods over at the… the Zimcoven woman, who is presumably still huddled by the illusory hearth. This whole time, Finnan's been sort of plucking on his fiddle a little bit, maintaining this illusion. We were about to speak to her when… A great wind and storm of snow. Grabbed us, and… Dragged us somewhere. But I begin to wonder if this really is the chasm.
[02:24:41.29 - 02:24:44.47] David Kong (Ekko): I'm not sure that it is. How many of you been to the Chasm?
[02:24:46.88 - 02:24:48.43] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Not below the river.
[02:24:52.86 - 02:24:55.34] David Kong (Ekko): YouTube, looking at the two at two other humans.
[02:24:55.90 - 02:24:57.54] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm not human, I'm a halfling.
[02:24:57.66 - 02:24:59.51] David Kong (Ekko): I know, the two… sorry, the two humans.
[02:24:59.51 - 02:25:00.07] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:25:00.24 - 02:25:02.24] David Schwartz (Justas): You can tell by his height, mostly.
[02:25:07.31 - 02:25:19.03] David Schwartz (Justas): It… Have we never in the chasm? you know, I've seen it from different… Parts of it from a distance. I know the contours of the place, but never in.
[02:25:20.64 - 02:25:21.18] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah.
[02:25:21.18 - 02:25:23.82] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I have business in Comeco from time to time.
[02:25:24.46 - 02:25:36.30] David Kong (Ekko): Hmm. Hmm. Well… And sorry if I missed this, so did you all speak to the woman, or no?
[02:25:36.30 - 02:25:36.94] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:25:37.40 - 02:25:40.05] David Kong (Ekko): Okay, and she… and then you told the story, you're saying that…
[02:25:41.78 - 02:25:47.14] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): True. Does the monastery at Kameko Is it below the river or above it?
[02:25:49.70 - 02:25:50.55] David Kong (Ekko): Below, right?
[02:25:50.80 - 02:25:51.54] Tim Sackton (Finnan): low.
[02:25:51.71 - 02:26:09.93] Mike Sackton (DM): It's… it's in the cliffside, about 600 or 800 feet below the river, and you have to get there either by flying, which is the expected way, or by climbing down these giant steps that are about 25 feet tall, that then have separate steps carved into them.
[02:26:12.10 - 02:26:13.31] Kate Sackton (Jrain): It's a lot of climbing.
[02:26:15.59 - 02:26:16.62] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Not for everyone.
[02:26:17.32 - 02:26:33.81] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean, it usually takes a day… usually people take 2 days to climb down, right? It's like… Probably 5,000 steps, or something like that, and you usually would camp On one of these giant steps, which is a nice little platform to camp on, and then keep going down the lake the second day.
[02:26:34.16 - 02:26:34.61] David Kong (Ekko): And, and we.
[02:26:34.61 - 02:26:36.41] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I love a lot of climbing, but…
[02:26:36.62 - 02:26:39.35] David Kong (Ekko): We think it's the, the giants that made this, the monastery.
[02:26:40.46 - 02:26:44.56] Mike Sackton (DM): It's certainly sized for giants. Whether they actually made it, nobody really knows.
[02:26:44.85 - 02:26:48.15] David Kong (Ekko): But is the mon… what's the… is the monastery giant-sized, or is it human-sized?
[02:26:48.57 - 02:26:57.01] Mike Sackton (DM): No, the buildings are all big. I mean, the Kenku have restructured it to fit the Kenku, but the monastery itself is large. It's big.
[02:26:57.10 - 02:26:58.14] David Kong (Ekko): Got it. But…
[02:26:58.27 - 02:27:02.81] Mike Sackton (DM): It's also kind of too, like, it's weird, like, nobody really can explain it, right? Like…
[02:27:06.37 - 02:27:15.06] Mike Sackton (DM): The Kenku took over and abandoned. like, the Kenko are the only ones that anybody knows who have inhabited it, but they didn't build it. It was already there when they moved in.
[02:27:15.34 - 02:27:43.62] David Kong (Ekko): Oh, this is… this is random. The Kenku in the… in the monastery should have, like… because I was thinking about, like, ways that they do, like, insignias and, like, ranks and shit like that, because they would be all about that, and I was like, oh, maybe they… I was like, they should have blood feathers. They should have, like, you know, blood feathers for, like, different, you know, blood from different animals and stuff that they find and kill inside the chasm. And then, like, different types of, like, blood feathers in different places, like, mean different things. Cool. Also, it's a cool turn, blood feathers.
[02:27:46.99 - 02:27:47.93] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I like it.
[02:27:48.81 - 02:27:52.13] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So… Where do you think we are?
[02:27:55.08 - 02:27:56.10] David Kong (Ekko): Who are you looking at?
[02:27:56.72 - 02:28:06.34] Tim Sackton (Finnan): at… sorry. It's hard when you're not in person. I'm looking at Echo, who seems to be… the most deeply connected to the chasm from the short conversation we've had.
[02:28:09.85 - 02:28:38.32] David Kong (Ekko): Do any of you, are you familiar with elemental magic, or any other magic? The reason I ask is, you know, I can't shake the feeling that Wherever we are, this is, magical in nature, and… this environment. We might be in the chasm, but… Somehow, in a… in a… In another space.
[02:28:40.37 - 02:29:44.00] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Hmm. Familiar with magic, but more of the magic of… stories than elements. I've been collecting stories for many years now, and… I find the strands of magic in many of them. But there's… Some strange story is about the West Wind, and about… the people here… I spent a while traveling On the other side of the Sentinels, about 10 years ago. So, people there, the Denecai, who speak A language that… Sounds strangely similar to old Zimkoven, although I never quite picked up the tongue. And among the elders of the Denon Kai, there are stories about when people first came to the forests on the western slopes. And sometimes would think, The trickster fae were gods.
[02:29:48.38 - 02:29:50.07] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It makes me wonder…
[02:29:55.04 - 02:29:55.76] David Kong (Ekko): You think the fan?
[02:29:58.32 - 02:29:59.12] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Could be.
[02:30:01.92 - 02:30:09.34] David Kong (Ekko): Mike, have there been… have there's ever there ever been a history? Is ECHO aware of anything, aware of any fixture, FE, FEY activity around here?
[02:30:16.13 - 02:31:20.59] Mike Sackton (DM): I don't… I think… I mean, the fey are not common. They're not… it's not like you've never heard of, sort of, fae activity, but they're not, like, a big part of, the… their experience. There are, you know, there are people who appease the cruel West Wind, and to some outsiders, it does seem kind of fey-like, in a way, right? Like, people will… people will leave out, you know. some food for the West Wind's children, right? And we'll… or will, you know, give… throw the… the best fish into the river to appease the West Winds children. And some outsiders sometimes think that is a little bit… GitHub. Fey-ish? But… but to… to the locals, most people would say, no, no, no, what are you talking about? It's the… it's the spirits of the West Wind.
[02:31:22.50 - 02:31:34.36] Kate Sackton (Jrain): if we can get a coherent answer, I'm kind of curious what she thinks you do to appease the West Wind, because I kind of have the feeling it's more than… Throwing a fish in the river.
[02:31:35.24 - 02:31:43.13] Mike Sackton (DM): Like I said, you could ask her, you could probably coax, like, 2 or 3 questions out of her. You could ask her.
[02:31:44.79 - 02:31:45.49] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, absolutely.
[02:31:45.49 - 02:31:55.24] Kate Sackton (Jrain): she said that we could follow up on, as far as I'm concerned, are the only way out is in And… something about appeasing the west wind.
[02:31:56.14 - 02:32:25.98] Mike Sackton (DM): She… she kind of… she kind of looks, like, at Finian a little bit, like… She kind of is noticing for the first time that you don't look… Human? And it's like, looks at you a second time? Kind of puzzled, like, actually, she's clearly never met a half-wife. What… and she looks at you kind of oddly for a minute, like… Wh-what are you?
[02:32:30.54 - 02:33:12.08] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Finan will be very, like, calm and understanding and gentle, and talk about… Just, like, spin a tale about travelers and wanderers who have… Pass through the world. For many, many years, even when there were Great. Swamps in the lowlands? And will apologize that none of them have found her village yet, and… Say that he is trying to make up for that deficit and bring… Stories and songs. To her people, too. And that's what his people do.
[02:33:12.57 - 02:33:28.61] Mike Sackton (DM): She seems… she sort of processes that, but doesn't seem too bothered, right? Like, she sort of calms… she, like, realizes, okay, I guess you're a traveler. She kind of accepts that story. She doesn't seem to have put together the two bird-like creatures as things keep talking.
[02:33:28.61 - 02:33:31.59] Kate Sackton (Jrain): And she's not saying anything about Elo, and…
[02:33:31.59 - 02:33:48.91] Mike Sackton (DM): Well, neither of them have tried to talk to her. She doesn't seem to be processing them as, like, humans, as sentient creatures. I mean, she doesn't… she's, like, not even really noticing she's, like, barely looking up, like, she's basically huddled like this, and kind of only looks up when Finian comes to talk to her.
[02:33:48.91 - 02:33:52.00] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I mean, she came up into the Kamiko Monastery, though, she was…
[02:33:52.00 - 02:33:54.77] Mike Sackton (DM): She was terrified of the Kenku, though. She wouldn't talk to them.
[02:33:55.09 - 02:33:55.78] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Okay.
[02:33:56.15 - 02:33:58.97] Mike Sackton (DM): Right? She, like, had no idea. She, like, was… that's one of the reasons.
[02:33:58.97 - 02:34:01.92] Kate Sackton (Jrain): She didn't know she could talk to them. That was one of the problems.
[02:34:01.92 - 02:34:23.69] Mike Sackton (DM): Yes, exactly. One of the… one of the challenges, and one of the reasons you left with her was because she was… thought the Kenkyu were basically monsters, like, she was totally… and probably they were all carrying their blood feathers around and be like, we killed 17 bloodhawks today, we're the coolest, right? They probably were not the most welcoming, but… She says. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:34:24.36 - 02:34:25.50] David Kong (Ekko): beans.
[02:34:27.75 - 02:34:28.55] Mike Sackton (DM): beings.
[02:34:28.81 - 02:34:33.04] David Kong (Ekko): Just looking at the non-Kenku, like, not people, beings.
[02:34:34.02 - 02:34:37.25] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Oh. Okay. Thank you.
[02:34:38.03 - 02:34:39.82] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, it's alright, just so you know.
[02:34:40.54 - 02:34:42.93] Mike Sackton (DM): She says to figure it out.
[02:34:42.93 - 02:34:44.83] David Kong (Ekko): Human-focused, that's all. Go ahead, sorry.
[02:34:44.83 - 02:34:59.28] Mike Sackton (DM): To answer the question, she, she, she says, well, once… when the… When the sun sets.
[02:35:04.30 - 02:35:28.78] Mike Sackton (DM): And the… and the new… and the new ones are… old enough. the West Wind demands… A sacrifice. And… and one of us… is sent. She kind of looks up. Through the cloud. Into its labyrinth.
[02:35:37.53 - 02:35:41.18] Kate Sackton (Jrain): And after the visit, do you… well, I don't know, I can't ask questions.
[02:35:43.64 - 02:35:44.24] Mike Sackton (DM): Hey.
[02:35:53.74 - 02:36:04.74] Mike Sackton (DM): I do not know what she just… she looks like. The sun must have risen by now. It will be a while before the next sacrifice.
--- Scouting and Prepartions ---
[02:36:18.12 - 02:36:18.82] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Hmm.
[02:36:28.67 - 02:36:36.68] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Finnen will… well, kind of… Thoughtfully look up at the clouds.
[02:36:39.05 - 02:36:45.69] Mike Sackton (DM): And you can't… I mean, you can't see anything except the light from the dim… from your light. Like, you can just see the very bottom of the storm.
[02:36:54.84 - 02:37:02.94] Mike Sackton (DM): So… I mean, I'm gonna say, you guys may as well take a short… you've been talking for long enough that you can probably just… you should probably just take a short rest.
[02:37:05.76 - 02:37:06.39] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:37:07.33 - 02:37:17.07] Mike Sackton (DM): Unless you… unless you… Want to do something else. Bet.
[02:37:21.82 - 02:37:25.62] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean, as you're talking, after maybe…
[02:37:25.62 - 02:37:40.03] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Oh, so the other thing I'm gonna do, actually, when there's a… when there's a minute. when Finnan's not, like, actively engaged, or has a minute to kind of step away from the group, I'm gonna ritual cast. Detect Magic.
[02:37:40.64 - 02:37:41.17] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay?
[02:37:41.17 - 02:37:41.77] David Kong (Ekko): dude.
[02:37:43.57 - 02:37:47.39] Mike Sackton (DM): M… Justice's shield is magic.
[02:37:47.95 - 02:37:50.60] Tim Sackton (Finnan): That drains Clocus magic.
[02:37:51.28 - 02:37:52.04] Mike Sackton (DM): Ehhh.
[02:37:52.04 - 02:37:53.69] Tim Sackton (Finnan): With no other magic anywhere.
[02:37:55.15 - 02:37:56.19] David Kong (Ekko): Kaizen Magic?
[02:37:57.26 - 02:37:59.23] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Giant white cloud is not magic.
[02:37:59.70 - 02:38:08.37] Mike Sackton (DM): The… The sky… is not… I mean…
[02:38:13.99 - 02:38:25.64] Mike Sackton (DM): It's actually an interesting ques… I actually don't… I know I have to consult with you, Tim, about what is patching. You get this, I mean…
[02:38:27.92 - 02:38:29.89] David Kong (Ekko): The spell's like, meh.
[02:38:30.15 - 02:38:30.78] Mike Sackton (DM): Ehh…
[02:38:33.91 - 02:38:36.70] Mike Sackton (DM): No, you don't, you don't… nothing to tag, nothing's magical.
[02:38:36.70 - 02:38:37.41] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Okay.
[02:38:38.61 - 02:38:51.35] David Kong (Ekko): I mean… Obviously, we'd come back, but we could just try flying out of here and seeing what's on the other side of that cloud. YOLO, she wanna go check it out?
[02:38:53.49 - 02:38:58.67] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): -Oh, just recharging my… Nick Power thing.
[02:38:58.67 - 02:39:00.81] Mike Sackton (DM): Don't they only be checked on a long rest?
[02:39:01.59 - 02:39:05.58] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): It says, you can… you remain one…
[02:39:05.58 - 02:39:08.55] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, you were getting one and a short rest. Yeah.
[02:39:11.00 - 02:39:12.02] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I mean… Tom.
[02:39:12.55 - 02:40:19.24] Mike Sackton (DM): As you've been talking, the… like… After… you've sort of been talking for a while, and like, you've been engaged with each other and stuff, and the… but you've noticed the… the… the cloud is kind of… shrinking lower, and the wind is now just howling a little bit more. There's, like, occasional direct swirls come out of the cloud down, like, little mini whirlwinds of snow come down and, like, touch the… touch the ice. And the draft is higher, right? Like, I guess you don't have any… you have nothing that would actually flicker in the… but, like, your feathers ruffle a little bit more, like, the wind is just blowing a little bit stronger. And every once in a while, you… you just… you hear, like, a howl on the wind, like, not… That, like, animal… just, like… just, like… It doesn't sound like the wind, but it doesn't really sound like an animal either, it just sounds primal.
[02:40:23.05 - 02:40:40.83] Mike Sackton (DM): And, you know, so as one of these whirlwinds of snow, touches down the, The woman, like, curls even tighter into herself, and is like… It doesn't like waiting.
[02:40:44.28 - 02:40:45.01] David Kong (Ekko): The wind?
[02:40:46.64 - 02:40:47.69] Mike Sackton (DM): The beast.
[02:40:49.02 - 02:40:49.87] David Kong (Ekko): What beast.
[02:40:51.62 - 02:40:57.01] Mike Sackton (DM): Zyphus… Minion. The beast in the… in the maze.
[02:40:59.17 - 02:41:00.23] David Kong (Ekko): Where's the maze?
[02:41:01.68 - 02:41:02.76] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Maybe we're in it.
[02:41:03.64 - 02:41:04.51] Mike Sackton (DM): to kind of…
[02:41:06.51 - 02:41:07.97] David Schwartz (Justas): platforms and bridges.
[02:41:09.43 - 02:41:12.90] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm gonna… there's, like… what is the ground made out of?
[02:41:12.90 - 02:41:13.67] Mike Sackton (DM): Ice.
[02:41:13.67 - 02:41:14.11] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice.
[02:41:14.11 - 02:41:23.38] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm just gonna, like, chip off enough ice to make, like, a little snowball, cast light on it, and, like… Chuck it down the path of one of the bridges.
[02:41:24.85 - 02:41:51.86] Mike Sackton (DM): It… Skitters down the bridge about 20… 15 or 20 feet, and then… fall, like. You see it kind of go over a little bit of an edge, and then you can see, glowing, like, there's still a faint glow coming up from the edge of the bridge. Like, it skittered along the bridge, and then it rolled off on the far end, which… it was hard to see the details, because…
[02:41:51.86 - 02:41:52.88] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It's like…
[02:41:52.95 - 02:42:08.38] Mike Sackton (DM): But you could still see the glove, I mean, it's still… it couldn't have fallen that far, because you still see the glow. Like, it just fell maybe 10 feet, and it's now, like, you can see a glow coming up. Kind of illuminating, a space.
[02:42:10.41 - 02:42:11.90] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Same thing on the other bridge.
[02:42:12.72 - 02:42:20.37] Mike Sackton (DM): Yep. It kind of maybe… it's maybe, like, fell into a snowbank or something? Like, it's hard to tell exactly what it fell into without walking over there.
[02:42:20.63 - 02:42:26.74] David Schwartz (Justas): I'll do the same thing, but lean over the edge of the platform and just drop something straight down below me with light on it.
[02:42:28.60 - 02:42:55.15] Mike Sackton (DM): So, it… it… Falls about… 10 feet, and then it comes, like, you hear a gust of wind, like a strong sound of the wind, and it comes, like, at high speed, flying back up and slams into the… into the ice. I mean, presumably this was a piece of ice, so it… I mean, whatever it was, if it was another piece of ice, shatters and skitters across the ice.
[02:42:56.43 - 02:43:06.54] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm… Eula looks over at Echo and says, I wonder… Starts to step over to the edge.
[02:43:06.95 - 02:43:09.74] David Kong (Ekko): Echo also gets over to the edge. Let's do it.
[02:43:12.61 - 02:43:13.29] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Count of 3.
[02:43:13.70 - 02:43:16.56] David Kong (Ekko): 2… 1… Alright, we go.
[02:43:16.91 - 02:43:18.76] Mike Sackton (DM): What are you, what are you doing?
[02:43:18.92 - 02:43:25.23] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Well, Yolo's idea was just to leap straight down and see if the, gust pushes him back up and do an amazing trick.
[02:43:25.35 - 02:43:28.31] David Kong (Ekko): Too much… too much testiculating. Okay, there you go.
[02:43:28.31 - 02:43:31.29] David Schwartz (Justas): just turns to Finn, and they seemed nice. Where to now?
[02:43:31.66 - 02:43:35.87] Mike Sackton (DM): So… so hold on. So, YOLO jumps!
[02:43:35.88 - 02:43:37.19] David Kong (Ekko): No, we both jumped, we both jumped.
[02:43:37.19 - 02:43:40.15] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so you're jumping, and just see what happens.
[02:43:40.15 - 02:43:43.01] David Kong (Ekko): We're diving into the… we're just going down. Yeah, we're diving down.
[02:43:43.01 - 02:43:44.68] Mike Sackton (DM): Make strength saving throws.
[02:43:45.63 - 02:43:46.55] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, boy.
[02:43:46.55 - 02:43:56.73] David Kong (Ekko): I'm sure this is gonna be good. I really just wanted to do the arm thing with Eric, that was kind That was our main discussion in the breakout room? about that.
[02:43:57.08 - 02:44:01.21] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Whew! Unusual role for strength like that at 22.
[02:44:03.50 - 02:44:04.21] David Kong (Ekko): One.
[02:44:04.61 - 02:44:05.28] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[02:44:06.12 - 02:44:08.04] David Kong (Ekko): I rolled a 2, but I have a minus 1 on my strength, so…
[02:44:08.04 - 02:44:10.75] Mike Sackton (DM): Right. And wait, you got a 22, you said?
[02:44:10.99 - 02:44:11.76] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yeah.
[02:44:11.76 - 02:44:12.65] David Kong (Ekko): How'd you do that?
[02:44:13.47 - 02:44:15.64] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I rolled very high.
[02:44:15.64 - 02:44:17.44] David Kong (Ekko): What's your, what's your modifier for Strike?
[02:44:17.83 - 02:44:19.47] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I think it's also minus 1.
[02:44:19.47 - 02:44:20.75] Tim Sackton (Finnan): But he has a plus…
[02:44:20.75 - 02:44:21.47] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, no, it's…
[02:44:22.03 - 02:44:24.55] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You've got a plus 3 to the strength save.
[02:44:24.55 - 02:44:25.34] Mike Sackton (DM): Right.
[02:44:25.34 - 02:44:26.99] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, from some…
[02:44:26.99 - 02:44:28.56] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You're proficient in strength.
[02:44:28.91 - 02:44:31.68] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): So, you both jump off.
[02:44:32.12 - 02:44:59.63] Mike Sackton (DM): And… you… glide, you know, you sort of fly down maybe 15 feet when this very strong wind, catches, like, this… just this gust of this, like, wind. It catches you. Echo, you're just flung up, like, with violent force, and, like, catapulted over the… the… back onto the platform and smashed face-first into the ice, you take 16 points of damage.
[02:44:59.92 - 02:45:00.29] David Kong (Ekko): Dammit.
[02:45:02.67 - 02:45:21.01] Mike Sackton (DM): YOLO, you are not… the wind is buffeting you, and you're… but you… but you maintain your position, right? Like, you… you're kind of… you're hovering carefully, like… a few minutes, you know, I don't know if you, if you, if you wait, another gust will probably come, and you can't go down it.
[02:45:21.84 - 02:45:29.14] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): My intention was to see what was down there, and then use the power of the gust to do an amazing, like, triple backflip back onto the platform.
[02:45:30.28 - 02:45:53.37] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so are you gonna… so you can't keep going, like, swimming… not swimming, flying further down, it feels impossible, right? I mean, maybe if you were much stronger, you could try and push your way, but at the moment, you're, like, being pushed up with a strong enough force that you can't keep going. But you're, like, balancing such that it's not actually flinging you up. So, you could try and just…
[02:45:53.37 - 02:45:55.28] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): clean trick. Yeah.
[02:45:55.28 - 02:45:56.71] Mike Sackton (DM): You're gonna try to do that.
[02:45:56.71 - 02:45:59.25] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Push myself down, and then bounce back up, yeah.
[02:45:59.25 - 02:46:02.67] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, make a… make a dex. make a DEX.
[02:46:03.85 - 02:46:04.82] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Acrobatics.
[02:46:05.20 - 02:46:23.96] Mike Sackton (DM): well, just roll DEX, and you don't have any… do you have any reason why you'd be proficient in this kind of thing? Well, I forget what you said, your background, your background… so the idea behind the narrative proficiencies is I'm trying to say instead of what skill to use, just what ability to use, and then if your narrative proficiencies.
[02:46:23.96 - 02:46:24.38] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Ugh.
[02:46:24.74 - 02:46:30.74] Mike Sackton (DM): would apply, you could say, well, I'm really good at this, and you get to add your proficiency bonus.
[02:46:31.03 - 02:46:39.67] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Yolo has an unwavering and insanely powerful belief in himself to do tricks. He is ultra-confident.
[02:46:40.21 - 02:46:44.67] Mike Sackton (DM): Specifically, because you can't just say he's ultra-confident and therefore gets to succeed.
[02:46:44.67 - 02:46:48.27] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It applies to all ability checks that involve showing off.
[02:46:48.48 - 02:46:50.12] Mike Sackton (DM): There you go, perfect! That's what I'm doing.
[02:46:50.12 - 02:46:51.03] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's what I'm talking about.
[02:46:51.03 - 02:46:54.57] Mike Sackton (DM): That's what you're asking for. Like a competition, or… Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[02:46:54.57 - 02:46:55.19] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Very true.
[02:46:55.19 - 02:46:57.34] Mike Sackton (DM): Add 7, roll D20, add 7.
[02:46:58.03 - 02:47:04.10] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Nice. Alright, so… I don't know how to do the plus on this stuff.
[02:47:04.10 - 02:47:11.01] Mike Sackton (DM): You just roll a straight D20, or just roll… click on the… see the plus 4 under your decks? Just roll the decks, and then add 3 to that.
[02:47:11.21 - 02:47:13.99] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh, so my raw D20 roll was 11.
[02:47:14.15 - 02:47:35.01] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, so add 7 as an 18. Yeah. So, y'all, Comes flying out, does a backflip, skates along the ice, a triple backflip, lands with one foot along the ice, puts the back foot claw down to drag to a halt, and stops right in front of Echo, who is bleeding with his face punched in by the ice.
[02:47:35.51 - 02:47:37.73] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Oh man, Echo, what happened?
[02:47:39.04 - 02:47:50.58] David Kong (Ekko): Echo gets up, wets the blood off his face. Peak. It smooths out his feathers. Well, yeah, so we can't fly down there, that's for sure.
[02:47:52.55 - 02:47:53.64] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Well.
[02:47:54.65 - 02:47:57.18] David Kong (Ekko): Looks like we have to go one of these two paths, huh?
[02:47:57.64 - 02:48:16.90] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah, I think… We're gonna have to walk out of here. Hannah… Interested to see… I'll look over at the… the Zimkova woman, and… If I haven't before, I'm gonna ask her what her name is.
[02:48:17.37 - 02:48:25.21] Mike Sackton (DM): Oh, yeah. Her name… no, no, no, I had it, I just… I closed it to look at the Gestapo. Her name is Kalima.
[02:48:30.63 - 02:48:42.22] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'll say to Kalima. Which, I'll just try and get a sense from her if she has any idea, like, are the… does the path matter? Like, do people…
[02:48:43.17 - 02:48:53.60] Mike Sackton (DM): she sort of shakes her head and is, like, the… All paths lead to the beast. I… I don't know how I escaped.
[02:48:57.04 - 02:48:58.60] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): What is this beast?
[02:49:00.00 - 02:49:13.41] Mike Sackton (DM): She'd never met the Beast, right? All she knows is this story. I mean, she kind of… She's not totally convinced you guys couldn't kill the beast, you did a pretty good job killing these scary wolf things.
[02:49:13.83 - 02:49:14.70] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's right.
[02:49:14.97 - 02:49:49.80] Mike Sackton (DM): but she, she doesn't… I mean, there's… she doesn't have any specific knowledge of what the beast is, but… but she sort of… she tells you that it's kind of like… it… it's… it's… she doesn't know, like… like, she doesn't really know how she found a way out. She said she found… she saw a… a… An earthen tunnel, and she just dug through it. But she doesn't know how she found it. Ed.
[02:49:49.80 - 02:49:50.84] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I know.
[02:49:51.24 - 02:49:55.39] Mike Sackton (DM): And the paths generally all lead to the beast, she says.
[02:49:55.39 - 02:49:58.75] David Kong (Ekko): Wait, so when we… can she only understand Finian, or can she understand.
[02:49:58.75 - 02:50:08.76] Mike Sackton (DM): and justice, only if they need justice. But they can translate. Although. Although, if you guys… if you, like, if Echo… Well, tell me what you're trying to do.
[02:50:08.97 - 02:50:11.74] David Kong (Ekko): Just wanna talk. Can we just talk and then assume that the translating is happening?
[02:50:11.74 - 02:50:19.44] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm… I'm, like, still trying to keep this illusion up so that she can't… she can't see outside of the… Okay.
[02:50:19.44 - 02:50:22.11] Mike Sackton (DM): So you're keeping the Kentu kind of hidden from her, right.
[02:50:22.11 - 02:50:22.91] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yes.
[02:50:23.33 - 02:50:24.22] David Kong (Ekko): Oh, fine.
[02:50:24.22 - 02:50:25.78] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I don't want her to freak out.
[02:50:25.78 - 02:50:27.44] David Kong (Ekko): Fine, fine, fine, yeah, get it.
[02:50:27.44 - 02:50:31.81] Mike Sackton (DM): But you can talk and pass along the message. Yeah, that's what we're doing, yeah.
[02:50:31.81 - 02:50:35.22] David Kong (Ekko): So, just… are we in the maze now?
[02:50:37.08 - 02:50:43.27] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, this is the entrance. Which way? This is… she… I mean, she fell through the same…
[02:50:43.27 - 02:50:43.82] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:43.82 - 02:50:44.53] Mike Sackton (DM): sheet.
[02:50:44.53 - 02:50:46.34] David Kong (Ekko): There's… but there's two paths right now, right?
[02:50:47.18 - 02:50:51.03] Mike Sackton (DM): doesn't matter. The maze takes you where the maze wants to take you.
[02:50:51.61 - 02:50:52.15] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[02:50:54.08 - 02:50:56.58] David Kong (Ekko): Let's… let's get out of here, then. Let's move… let's keep moving.
[02:50:56.86 - 02:51:20.21] Tim Sackton (Finnan): So, just one quick metagame thing, so Druids can use… a… either a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast Find Familiar without material components, so if you wanted to, you could summon a familiar, and send it to Go Scout. But it might just vanish into the mists, and you'd never see it again.
[02:51:21.91 - 02:51:22.53] David Kong (Ekko): Cool.
[02:51:22.86 - 02:51:24.66] Mike Sackton (DM): Nate can also summon her bird.
[02:51:26.00 - 02:51:28.67] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Not according to the rules.
[02:51:28.93 - 02:51:31.64] Kate Sackton (Jrain): And he said it had to be right after a long rest.
[02:51:32.55 - 02:51:35.41] Tim Sackton (Finnan): You can only summon the beast when you complete a long rest.
[02:51:38.46 - 02:51:40.61] Tim Sackton (Finnan): But you don't have to play it that way.
[02:51:40.61 - 02:51:43.89] Mike Sackton (DM): No, I think you could… you could… .
[02:51:43.89 - 02:51:48.16] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Normally, if it dies, you have to… if it dies, you have to take a… either.
[02:51:48.16 - 02:51:48.53] Mike Sackton (DM): Yay!
[02:51:48.53 - 02:51:50.47] Tim Sackton (Finnan): spell slot to heal it, or…
[02:51:50.47 - 02:51:57.57] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but, I didn't intend… .
[02:51:57.61 - 02:52:00.92] Kate Sackton (Jrain): You didn't intend you can only have 10 arrows and everything you can.
[02:52:00.92 - 02:52:06.36] Mike Sackton (DM): No, no, no, no, no, sorry, I didn't realize how your… I… when it burned up, and that was several days ago.
[02:52:06.72 - 02:52:08.20] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Right. So…
[02:52:08.20 - 02:52:09.47] Mike Sackton (DM): Here's what I… In Denver.
[02:52:09.80 - 02:52:11.49] Kate Sackton (Jrain): You tell me if you're the DM.
[02:52:11.49 - 02:52:12.02] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah.
[02:52:12.02 - 02:52:29.77] Kate Sackton (Jrain): But I heard that every morning I wake up. And Rolla appears, and we have a frolicking fun day together. Yeah. Except that this morning I woke up, and Rolla appeared, and I went off to go travel with a Zimca woman, and a giant storm of immense wind capacity whipped me into another dimension.
[02:52:29.77 - 02:52:32.45] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, but Rollo could have survived the storm.
[02:52:32.81 - 02:52:33.79] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Okay, so she's.
[02:52:33.79 - 02:52:54.36] Mike Sackton (DM): Because, I mean, the Zimco woman only had 5 hit points, she survived the storm. So there's no reason why Rolla wouldn't have survived the storm. I thought it was like a familiar that you summoned and dismissed whenever you wanted. So, I thought you just didn't have… no, Rawa would have survived the storm. There's not a… I mean, none of you took damage.
[02:52:54.36 - 02:52:58.61] Kate Sackton (Jrain): She wasn't so battered by the wind that she disappeared, and I can't see her again until tomorrow morning.
[02:52:58.61 - 02:52:59.56] Mike Sackton (DM): Yes, yes.
[02:52:59.56 - 02:53:00.71] Kate Sackton (Jrain): That's good news.
[02:53:02.96 - 02:53:04.04] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean…
[02:53:06.90 - 02:53:11.34] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, I'd do that. I, I, I get up, familiar.
[02:53:13.22 - 02:53:14.16] Mike Sackton (DM): Are you using…
[02:53:14.16 - 02:53:15.99] David Kong (Ekko): What are… what are some good animals?
[02:53:16.32 - 02:53:25.03] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Well, your only choices are… Your only choices are…
[02:53:25.98 - 02:53:36.17] Mike Sackton (DM): You… you do… just one… one note, you do get a strong sense from this… from Kalima, that, like. This is not… the labyrinth is not the kind of place you sleep.
[02:53:38.59 - 02:53:39.36] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Hmm.
[02:53:39.36 - 02:53:41.07] David Kong (Ekko): I don't want to waste both slots doing this.
[02:53:43.22 - 02:53:44.97] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah, I mean…
[02:53:44.97 - 02:53:47.81] Kate Sackton (Jrain): If Rolla's already here, maybe we should just send her.
[02:53:47.81 - 02:53:49.99] David Kong (Ekko): Yeah, I'll see that. Rawl is here, let's see that.
[02:53:53.32 - 02:53:58.02] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Right. Having gone unnoticed as she stayed through…
[02:53:58.02 - 02:54:05.83] Mike Sackton (DM): I'm gonna say she was battered by the fall and recovered. You nursed her back to life as… to health as part of the short rest.
[02:54:06.08 - 02:54:06.84] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Alright, Grace.
[02:54:06.84 - 02:54:11.35] Mike Sackton (DM): You guys also, by the way, anybody who wants to spend hit dice during the short rest, you certainly can.
[02:54:11.35 - 02:54:11.91] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yep.
[02:54:12.29 - 02:54:12.86] David Schwartz (Justas): Yep.
[02:54:15.61 - 02:54:17.92] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, so you're sending Rolla?
[02:54:18.17 - 02:54:19.58] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I am sending Rolla.
[02:54:23.67 - 02:54:33.36] Mike Sackton (DM): What is Rolla? I guess I should have read your Beastmaster abilities more carefully. Rawa has darkvision, and can Rolla communicate with you mentally?
[02:54:34.02 - 02:54:34.61] Tim Sackton (Finnan): No.
[02:54:35.22 - 02:54:35.97] Kate Sackton (Jrain): No.
[02:54:37.25 - 02:54:41.44] Mike Sackton (DM): So you just, like, give her instructions, and she goes off and then comes back?
[02:54:41.97 - 02:54:42.62] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yes.
[02:54:42.89 - 02:54:44.65] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, what instructions are you giving her?
[02:54:46.28 - 02:54:56.78] Kate Sackton (Jrain): I say… We're gonna head off in this direction, can you go a short ways and see if there's any obvious, dangerous beasts?
[02:54:58.61 - 02:56:14.36] Mike Sackton (DM): She… how… Okay, she… she comes back a few minutes later and basically tells you there's a… There's a… there's a room. Like, the bridge leads… into, like, the ceiling of a… of, like, a snowbank, basically. And there's an opening, but you can jump down into the snow. It's like… And then there's four, sort of, passageways going off into, like, Going, like. The geometry is kind of a little hard to understand, like, it doesn't quite seem… Like, it totally fits, but there's basically four branches, like, 4 going, like, into the… it, like, tunnels into the snow. So it's almost like a massive snow bank, and there's, like, these four narrow tunnels, like, weaving… Bleeding into the snow. Each going out. So it's probably your best mental picture, is you're in an empty black space, floating, with all this wind, and then there's snow over there somewhere, and you can jump into it, and then there's these four tunnels, each… your bird didn't go down through any of the four tunnels. But there was no signs of any creatures.
[02:56:17.89 - 02:56:20.02] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Alright, let's go get ourselves lost.
[02:56:22.22 - 02:56:22.93] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:56:23.33 - 02:56:34.93] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Are we gonna… I mean, poor… Poor Kalima doesn't seem to have the vibe of wanting to go back in, but on the other hand, she doesn't seem to be safe just sitting here.
[02:56:37.09 - 02:56:42.48] Mike Sackton (DM): Indeed! She's not gonna go back in, unless you physically drag her.
[02:56:42.83 - 02:56:43.58] Kate Sackton (Jrain): Alright.
[02:56:45.27 - 02:56:50.43] Mike Sackton (DM): I mean… You could physically drag her.
[02:56:51.45 - 02:56:51.97] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Wow.
[02:56:51.97 - 02:56:52.82] Mike Sackton (DM): It's not necessarily…
[02:56:52.82 - 02:56:59.02] Tim Sackton (Finnan): the dragger. I guess Justice could probably physically drag her. Maybe drain.
[02:56:59.02 - 02:57:08.62] David Schwartz (Justas): I feel like we… I… we can persuade her. I'm gonna take a crack at, like, persuading her to… Like, she's gonna be safer, for sure, with us than…
[02:57:08.62 - 02:57:12.05] Mike Sackton (DM): Left alone? Like, who knows what random shit's gonna show up to…
[02:57:12.05 - 02:57:12.89] David Schwartz (Justas): Chomper.
[02:57:14.16 - 02:57:16.86] Mike Sackton (DM): Alright, make a… make a persuasion check.
[02:57:17.86 - 02:57:21.28] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm… I'm gonna… I'm gonna help Justice with this.
[02:57:21.66 - 02:57:22.14] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay.
[02:57:22.14 - 02:57:28.20] David Schwartz (Justas): That's, 18… I still have… I think I still have a Bardic Inspiration floating around, if.
[02:57:29.44 - 02:57:32.48] Tim Sackton (Finnan): It only lasts an hour, so if we took a short rest, you don't.
[02:57:32.48 - 02:57:33.67] David Schwartz (Justas): Oh, okay, nevermind.
[02:57:33.67 - 02:57:36.50] Tim Sackton (Finnan): But I'm… I'm helping with you, so you have advantage.
[02:57:37.12 - 02:57:43.25] David Schwartz (Justas): Right. Do that again… 18 is the better of the two.
[02:57:47.51 - 02:57:51.08] Mike Sackton (DM): What's, what's your, like, your argument it should be safer with you?
[02:57:51.86 - 02:57:52.45] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah.
[02:57:53.21 - 02:58:03.41] Mike Sackton (DM): She kind of looks around at you for a minute, at the group of you, and kind of… Looks at the two… Bird creatures? What are they?
[02:58:05.34 - 02:58:14.04] David Schwartz (Justas): They're, they're a Kenku. They're, they're perfectly ordinary, results of COVID that they can't understand, I presume.
[02:58:14.08 - 02:58:15.94] Kate Sackton (Jrain): They're perfectly ordinary.
[02:58:16.18 - 02:58:31.33] David Schwartz (Justas): Person-bird hybrids, you know, it's… It's just one of those things, they're from another… Another part of the country. I've seen… I've seen so many Kenku. They're perfectly lovely. They're, you know, they're on their own trip, but they're… they're nice.
[02:58:35.04 - 02:58:36.84] David Kong (Ekko): I think he's saying good stuff about us.
[02:58:37.35 - 02:58:45.35] Mike Sackton (DM): She looks? A little terrified, but is like… Wait, who cast healing on her?
[02:58:45.66 - 02:58:46.59] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Finn in.
[02:58:46.78 - 02:58:56.49] Mike Sackton (DM): spinning. She's like… if I could… if I could… stay between the two of you, maybe, pointing to Justice and Finian.
[02:58:58.44 - 02:58:59.64] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah.
[02:58:59.64 - 02:59:00.35] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[02:59:00.35 - 02:59:04.62] David Schwartz (Justas): Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, until you get to know them a little bit better.
[02:59:04.94 - 02:59:14.77] Mike Sackton (DM): Don't… Don't… promise… on the Kestavo, who are not here. That you won't leave me down there.
[02:59:17.92 - 02:59:20.14] David Schwartz (Justas): I promise, says Justice.
[02:59:21.35 - 02:59:23.94] Mike Sackton (DM): Okay, you convince her. She'll come with you.
[02:59:26.99 - 02:59:42.96] David Schwartz (Justas): I'll say in common. She's coming with us. She hasn't met Kenku before, so she's a little freaked out by the… The two of you, just… just because it's new and different, not… Not because humans automatically have problems with Kenku.
[02:59:44.51 - 02:59:45.29] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): She's gonna love it.
[02:59:45.29 - 02:59:52.81] David Schwartz (Justas): I mean, like, she's literally never seen a Kenku before, so it's… It's just a lot for her. Go easy.
[02:59:58.22 - 03:00:02.19] Mike Sackton (DM): So, are you, jumping down into the snow tunnel?
[03:00:02.49 - 03:00:02.87] David Schwartz (Justas): Let's do it.
[03:00:02.87 - 03:00:03.49] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[03:00:03.65 - 03:00:09.62] Mike Sackton (DM): It's, it's 11.45. Are people good going another, like, 20 minutes, or do we want to stop now?
[03:00:11.39 - 03:00:17.55] Tim Sackton (Finnan): I'm good, but I'm not the one who falls asleep, so… I'll go with the group. Eric probably wants to go to bed.
[03:00:18.26 - 03:00:20.02] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): I, I, yeah.
[03:00:20.02 - 03:00:20.86] Mike Sackton (DM): We can stop now.
[03:00:20.86 - 03:00:22.02] David Schwartz (Justas): Lots of stuff now, yeah.
[03:00:22.02 - 03:00:27.32] Mike Sackton (DM): Yeah, yeah, we can stop now. We should… I realize it occurs to me we have not scheduled. We have to schedule.
[03:00:27.32 - 03:00:27.93] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Yeah.
[03:00:29.40 - 03:00:30.11] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): Cool.
[03:00:31.14 - 03:00:37.83] Mike Sackton (DM): Wow, I found this really fun, I hope you enjoyed it. It's not exactly what I expected to happen, but that's okay.
[03:00:38.05 - 03:00:39.08] Tim Sackton (Finnan): Never is.
[03:00:39.57 - 03:00:40.95] Eric Rosenbaum (Eolo): That's called the Indy.
[03:00:40.95 - 03:00:42.09] Mike Sackton (DM): Yep. No, it's fine.
