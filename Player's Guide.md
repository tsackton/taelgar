# The World of Taelgar

This short guide provides an overview to the races of Taelgar, magic and religion, and basic geography, places, and history, and orients players to their character options. It is written loosely from the perspective of an educated commoner in the year 1748, by the common reckoning of human scholars. This is a living document, last updated on **October 30, 2023.**

>[!info] The world of Taelgar is free of misogyny, racism, homophobia and gender panics. Characters should be men, women, or something else without fear it will limit their opportunities or that villagers will have historically accurate attitudes. It's a magical place created by the made up gods. Realistic sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and racism is pointless and unfun.

Taelgar draws inspiration from many sources, especially classic D&D settings, high fantasy, and world history. Magic is rare and powerful, but once was much more common; while humans dominate much of the world, they live alongside dwarves, halflings, and other sentient species. 
## Geography and Culture

The known world of Taelgar stretches 2,500 miles from the great city of [[Chardon]] in the West, to the shores of [[the Green Sea]] in the east.

![[player-map.png]]

- In the west, the vast [[Chardonian Empire]] extends north, east, and south from the imperial capital of [[Chardon]], growing rich and powerful on its magical scholarship and the might of its legions. 
- On the outskirts of the [[Chardonian Empire]] dwell various scattered northerners, the descendants of the earliest humans to settle Taelgar. 
	- In the forests and foothills on the eastern borders of [[Chardon]], the [[Deno'qai]] live in hidden villages, raising pigs and worshipping the [[tanshi]], the small gods of the land. 
	- On the coast of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], the seafaring Mawar people have lived symbiotically with the ocean for generations uncounted.
	- Further north, and on the various scattered coastal islands, other people may dwell, but little news reaches even educated commoners to the south and east of these lands. 
- The vast forests between the [[Chardonian Empire]] and the [[Sentinel Range]] once were the home of the elven kingdom of [[Ainumarya]], but since the [[Great War]] the once vibrant cities of the elves have largely fallen silent. 
- South of [[Chardon]], the [[Nevos Sea]] is home to the pirates of [[Illoria]], recently conquered by the Chardonian legions, and now a protectorate of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. 
- Southeast of [[Chardon]] and south of the [[Sentinel Range]], the Dunmari people of [[Dunmar]] are split, culturally and politically, between the sedentary farmers on the monsoon-drenched [[Western Dunmar|western coast]], and the nomadic herders of the arid plains and deserts of [[Central Dunmar|central]] and [[eastern Dunmar]]. 
- The dwarven kingdom of [[Nardith]] in the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] stretches between the [[Garamjala Desert]] and the coastal savannahs of [[Western Dunmar]]. 
- North and east of Dunmar is the Plaguelands, a vast wasteland created by the aftermath of the [[Great War]], where few sentient beings willingly dwell. 
- The [[Sentinel Range]] stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far north to the plains of Dunmar. The largest and most populous [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of Taelgar lie among and beneath these peaks. 
- Along the [[Western Gulf]], east of the [[Sentinel Range]] and north of the [[Plaguelands]] is the Kingdom of [[Sembara]], a hereditary monarchy on fertile agricultural land, known for its grain and prowess at arms. 
- North of Sembara, the city of [[Tollen|Tollen]] on the river [[River Volta|Volta]] sends navies across the [[Western Gulf]], and the powerful trade guilds of Tollen grow rich off the trade routes that crisscross the [[The Green Sea|Green Sea]]. 
- Further north, the cold, rocky, and forested land of [[Vostok]] and the islands of [[Skaerhem]] are home to the descendants of a proud mariner culture that once dominated the Green Sea. 
- [[Cymea]], across the [[Western Gulf]] from [[Sembara]], is home to an unruly collection of squabbling city-states, once, but no longer, the dominate maritime power on the Green Sea. 

To the east, south, and north, stranger lands exist in rumor and imagination, but few common folk of northwestern Taelgar have ever met anyone from these distant lands. 
## History

Long ago, in the ancient days of creation, the gods created sentient beings, first the Elder People, and later the humans, who grew and spread from their ancestral home on the now-lost continent of Hkar. In the aftermath of the cataclysm that destroyed Hkar, human refugees established the city of Drankor, south of what is now Dunmar. From this humble beginning, a great empire grew, based on magic, known as the Drankorian Empire. As the empire grew, it spread its language, religion, and culture across large swaths of Taelgar. 

Seven hundred years ago, the Drankorian empire fell, brought down by a magical plague that even the great wizards of Drankor could not stop. From the ashes of empire arose new realms and cities: Chardon, a center of learning and the great city of the west; Sembara, a powerful monarchy in the east; the Dunmari, people of the plains, migrating from the far away into the empty spaces left by the collapse of Drankor; and many others. But as these realms and others grew, the ancient skeletal dragon-god Cha'mutte was lurking in the north, biding his time and building his army of hobgoblins and worse.

Two hundred years ago, Cha'mutte tried to overthrow the gods. The Great War, although it lead to Cha'mutte's defeat, left the world changed. A vast crater now lies where mountain passes once carried trade caravans between Sembara and Chardon, and the fertile [[River Istaros|Istaros]] river valley is now a choking land of dust and ash, called the Plaguelands. For fifty years after the Great War ended, the remains of Cha'mutte's armies roamed the land. These years, known as the Blood Years, saw the boundaries of civilization shrink, trade decline, and famine and sorrow spread. 

Over the past few generations, though, a new normalcy has come to the land, as the Great War and its aftermath fades from memory. The Chardonian Empire now stretches a thousand miles, built on the backs of the magical secrets of the Great Library and the Chardonian legions, with their battle mages. Peace and trade have once again come to Sembara, and the merchants of Tollen and Cymea ply the Green Sea once more. The Dunmari thrive behind the divine protections that guard their eastern border from the evils of the Plaguelands. While the frontiers remain dangerous, the world that has emerged from the darkness is one of hope. 
## Species

While humans are by far the most numerous sentient species on Taelgar, many other sentient species of diverse culture, appearance, and origin share the world with them. 

The oldest sentient species on known as the Elder Folk, created by the influence and action of the divine firstborn of each race, known as the embodied gods. These species have long lifespans and unique connections to their creator gods that set them apart from humans and other sentient races. The Elder Folk  include:
- The elves, the oldest of the Elder Folk, ancient and fey, graceful and full of magic. The elves have always defended the world from evil, ut this has taken a toll, and the elves are much reduced in number in recent years after the tragedy of the [[Great War]]. Many elves now look inward, seeking to nurture and protect their own people
Five races (elves, dwarves, stoneborn, lizardfolk, and halflings) are known as the Elder Races. They were created by the Divine before time, through the influence and action of the Firstborn of their race. These races draw their strength and abilities through their connection to their Gods, which both gives them power and unique magic, and constrains them. While some of these races are relatively common (dwarves and halflings), others are uncommon (lizardfolk), or rare (elves, stoneborn). 

[Elves](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LubwNH3wBO1-n9L8MLu) are the oldest of the Elder races, ancient and fey, graceful and full of magic, but also haughty and aloof to the world of the younger races. [Stoneborn](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Lubw5j6u-KFTIbdi_Gm) are the children of the mountains, reclusive and content to watch the world below them. [Lizardfolk](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LubwPqvHgPLYMtwu74S) are creatures of the water, marsh and swamp, masters of dreams and the realm of spirits, skilled as healers. [Dwarves](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtFg6GJLYThfAVQlu80) are bold and brave and tradition-bound, as skilled in artistry as in battle, deeply committed to clan and home. [Halflings](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LubwU3GSx1YnKGpVelc) are wanderers and travelers, rarely settling in one place for long, but maintaining ties of kin through a collective racial memory.

[Humans](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LuboetFTPmjmXzKI2O3) are known as the Younger Race. They were created by the Divine at the beginning of time to spread and thrive across the world; they are the most numerous and diverse of all Divinely created races, free of ties to Firstborn that constrain their diversity.

While humans and the Elder races are most commonly seen in the cities and towns of Taelgar, many other races exist, as described below.

#### Dwarven Kingdoms
Dwarves are one of the most populous of the non-human races. Numerous Dwarven kingdoms dot both the central mountain chain and other hilly or mountainous areas around the world. While the center of Dwarven industry and influence is in the central mountains on the western frontier of Sembara, dwarves can be found in any land.

#### Stoneborn Communities
Stoneborn are much rarer than dwarves, and tend to live in small communities in isolated places, either high in mountains, far to the north, or in deserts. However, they are renowned throughout the world as masters of their craft and often attract students of all races, despite rarely leaving their homes.

#### Halfling Wanderers
Halflings have no permanent home beyond the road. Traveling caravans of halflings follow long trading circuits, bringing goods and wealth from far away to new communities. Other groups sail the seas. Some halflings settle in human communities, as well, and like dwarves they can be found in most places in the world.

#### Lizardfolk Conclaves
Lizardfolk form small, dispersed communities in sheltered natural areas throughout the world, largely but not exclusively near water. Particularly notable settlements can be found south and east of Chardon, and on the frontier between Sembara and Cymea.

#### Elven Cities
The cities of the elves are hidden now, and no longer centers of wonder and magic open to the world. No one really knows where all the elves have gone -- or even if they survived the Great War -- although an occasional elven traveler makes a home for themselves outside their homelands.

#### Other Races 

While humans and the Elder Races are the most commonly seen in the cities of Taelgar, many other races exist. From the Feywild, **satyrs** and **fairies** sometimes make a home in Taelgar, and rumors of stranger fey, creatures that can shift their form like **changelings** and **shifters**, are persistent. The **centaurs**, guardians of the natural order of the world, follow their mysterious migrations across the wildlands. The **Peronar**, the halfborn, part elf and part human, once the protectors and nobility of the ancestral homeland of humans on Hkar, now are thought gone, but whether they still linger in some forgotten refuge is unknown. Rumors exist of **orcs**, freed from the curse of the God of War, making a home for themselves far from the meddling influence of humanity, and even some **goblins**, fled from the authoritarian rule of their hobgoblin masters, may be found trying to make their way in the larger cities of the world.

**Kobolds**, the children of dragons, make mischief wherever they are found. Most people know **hobgoblins** as cold-hearted authoritarians with no regard for the gods or morality, but whether this is the fixed destiny of all of that race is not known with certainty by the scholars of this age. And rumors of stranger things persist: the **catfolk** from the distant deserts and lands to the east and south; small **gnomes**, the surface-dwelling distant cousins of dwarves; the flying bird people the **kenku**, who retreated to the far north after the Great War; the underwater kingdoms of the **merfolk** who rarely emerge to visit the terrestrial world; and perhaps even stranger things in the distant corners of the vast world of Taelgar.


## Religion and Cosmology


## Magic

Taelgar is a world rich in magic. While it comes in many flavors, fundamentally all magic in Taelgar is ultimately extra-planar energy flowing into Taelgar. The Firstborn races have their own racial magics that draw power from connections to their Divine creators. While the exact nature of these racial magics is not always widely known, rumors abound of elves manipulating the essence of magic itself, of dwarves and their runes of power, of lizardfolk and their connection to the realm of spirits, of halfling telepathy, of stoneborn able to change their bodies and strengthen there minds. While humans do not have racial magic, all races can learn through prayer and study how to draw magic from the Divine into Taelgar. This is the magic of clerics and paladins.

Some magic users learn to draw energy from the planes that are echoes of Taelgar itself, such as the dreamworld, the realms of the fey, and the dark energy of the shadow plane.
Druids and rangers, who draw on the magical resonances within the natural world itself, are this type of caster. Other magic users draw energy from the wild chaos of the
Plane of Magic itself, which intersects with Taelgar at connections known as ley lines. This arcane magic can be learned, as is done by wizards or bards, or it can be innate, as
is the case for sorcerers. Rumors abound of magical energy drawn from the Plane of
Consciousness, sometimes called the Plane of Souls, power that can be used to manipulate the world with mental force alone. And other magic users exist as well, such as warlocks
who gain their power through pacts with extraplanar entities.

## Languages

Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. In the part of Taelgar that is the focus of this guide, the primary trade tongue spoken is Common, the shared lingua franca of all areas that were at one time under the sphere of influence of the Drankorian empire, and some adjacent areas, including the Dunmari, and most parts of Varstok and Skagenland. Many non-human creatures also know Common, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. At the DM's discretion, conversing in trade tongue may lack nuance, and slightly increase the difficulty of any ability check that relies on clear understanding of meaning. ***This is a work in progress and details may change as new areas of the world are explored in play. Characters will always have an opportunity to retcon their language choices if elements of this section are revised.***
#### Human Languages
* **Drankorian**: The original language of the Drankorian empire. While no longer commonly spoken, it is still used as a scholarly language in Chardon and parts of Sembara. Drankorian shares an alphabet and some similarities with Sembaran, Chardonian, and Cymean.
    * **Sembaran**: A number of related languages and dialects spoken in Sembara, parts of Vorstok, and Cymea. Derived from Drankorian.
    * **Chardonian**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken in Chardon and areas west of mountains. Derived from Drankorian.
    * **Cymean**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken on the Cymean peninsula and along the coast of the Green Sea south of Cymea.
* **Dunmari**: A number of related languages derived from a southern tongue, unrelated to Drankorian, and spoken primarily in Dunmar. Adopted the Drankorian alphabet, however.
* **\<Unnamed Eastern Language>:** The language of the original people to settle the Green Sea. While now largely extinct, this alphabet lives on in the languages derived from it.
    * **Skaegish**: A group of ancient languages spoken by the Skaer. Uses the same writing as old languages in Tywingha and highland areas of Sembara, although those old languages are largely extinct. Uses the Eastern alphabet.
    * **Highlander**: A number of related languages spoken by some of the highlanders and in the far north of Vostok. Related to Skaegish, but has diverged significantly. Uses the Eastern alphabet.
* **Northlander**: A number of related ancient languages spoken by the original inhabitants of the lands west of the mountains, still spoken by a number of Northerlander communities.

#### Non-Human Languages
* **Elder tongues**: The Elder races, created by the Embodied Gods, were endowed with language and writing by their creators. While some of these languages are commonly learned by non-native speakers, others are mysterious.
    * **Dwarvish:** The language of the dwarves, uses a runic script, often learned by outsiders and traders who want to engage in commerce with the dwarven kingdoms.
    * **Elvish:** The language of the elves, and often associated with magic. Frequently learned by scholars of magic or history. 
    * **Lizarding:** The language of the lizardfolk. Often learned by those who spend time living in lizardfolk communities.
    * **Halfing:** The secretive and rarely taught language of the halflings, made even more difficult for outsiders to learn given the expectation that speakers of this language will use telepathic cues for emphasis. 
    * **Stoneborn:** The language of the Stoneborn. Often learned by those who spend time in Stoneborn communities.
* **Goblin:** The language invented by the hobgoblins, and spoken by goblinoids of all types, as well as many of the servants and slaves of hobgoblins. Uses its own invented alphabet. While not commonly heard in the cities of Taelgar, it is not difficult to learn.
* **Orcish:** The language gifted to the orcs by Thark, the God of War. While few outsiders speak this language or understand its unique alphabet, those who would engage with orcs in combat or negotiation (to the extent such a thing is possible) do sometimes find a way to learn this tongue.
* **Giant:** The language created by the elder titans of old, and now spoken by the giants and their descendants. Often learned by scholars, or traders who would venture to giant settlements. Commonly learned by dwarves, especially those of the central mountains.
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien abberations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Draconic:** The language of dragons. Few learn the pure, **High Draconic** tongue of the ancient wyrms of old. More commonly heard in Taelgar is **Low Draconic**, the native tongue of kobolds and lesser dragons. However, these tongues are mutually intelligeble, and *PCs should simply take Draconic as a language and not worry about the distinction between low and high dialetcs.*
* **Centaur:** The language of centaurs. Uses the Elvish alphabet. Something that many might learn, although most centaurs speak Elvish, Sylvan, or both in addition to their own tongue, and most outsiders who must speak with them do so in one of those tongues. 
* **Rare tongues:** Many other creatures in the world of Taelgar speak a language of their own, including many of the unusual or rarer races in the world. These might include the strange language of clicks and hisses the **Giant Eagles** speak, or the strange demonic-influenced barking tongue of **Gnolls.** Most of these are difficult, if not impossible, to learn to speak without magic (and few have a written alphabet).
* **Extraplanar languages:** Time and space do not work on the other planes as they do on the material plane, and each plane tends to be represented by a single language. These are typically difficult, although not impossible, for outsiders to learn.
    * **Sylvan:** The language of the Feywild, of satyrs and fairies and others. The most common extraplanar language to be learned by natives of the material plane.
    * **Shadowkar:** The language of the Shadowfell.
    * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively).
    * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss
    * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells
    * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms.


## Religon
Many religions can be found across the lands of Taelgar, and many gods and goddesses are worshipped by the people of
Taelgar. Belief and worshop has the power to shape the essence of the Divine, and so religions that prosper usually have strong gods, and those that fade usually have weak gods. Theologians who have studied the nature of the Divine teach that ultimately all the gods are but manifestations of the True Divine, the duality of Arhat (creation) and Malik (destruction), the truth at the center of the Divinity, but for most people the gods of their faith are more approachable than the unknownable essence of the true Divinity. Some of the major religions are briefly detailed below, although other gods are worshipped across the land.

### Mos Numena
The practices and traditions associated with the worship of the Eight Divines are known, broadly, as Mos Numera, from the Drankorian for the Way of the Divine, although in common usage these worship traditions are usually just called ‘the Way’.

This tradition is a set of practices, rituals, and beliefs that have grown up aroun the worship of the Eight Divines, and broadly, follows several basic tenets:

* The gods have a personal relationship with all, and priests are not the only source of prayer and blessing
* Practices, places, and people who have been blessed in the past are more likely to be blessed in the future
* The gods speak to humans in signs, riddles, and omens -- rarely are they clear

The Eight Divines are:

* The Mother (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing,
wisdom, associated with the moon)
* The Father (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated
with the sun)
* The Night Queen (goddess of darkness, death, sleep,
winter, associated with the night)
* The Warlord (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn,
associated with day)
* The Sibyl (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty)
* The Wanderer (god of travel, trade, strangers, and
outcasts)
* The Wyrdling (genderless diety of chaos, luck, fate,
storms, and weather)
* The Wilding (genderless diety of nature and elements)


### The Kestavo
The Kestavo is the ancient religion of northern Sembara and the Highlands, and is still practiced in some places in the highlands. It is a religion focused around small gods, the spirits of villages, streams, and hills, who are celebrated in their communities. These spirits, the kestavo, bring the prayers of their communities to Ako, the Divine. 

Although most kestavo are worshipped only by the people of their particular town or village, some kestavo have gained great fame and pilgrims come from far and wide to their shrines to ask for blessings to be passed along to Ako. These include:

* Romil, the glacier king, with his shrine in the tallest mountains in the north
* Kamak, the lurker, who dwells at the bottom of the great Lake Kamchak
* Besla, who came to the land in the ancient days from the Green Sea, and each spring asks Ahra to send the waters of her homeland to her for company, and thus brings the monsoon rains.

The kestavo are not the only spirits in the land, however. The cruel west wind, Ziva, and Vacla, the fire-below, have many offspring, the vazska. These spirits must be appeased or driven off, or they bring misfortune.

### The Five Siblings of the Dunmari
The religion of the Dunmari is an old religion, adapted and evolved from the old ways when the Dunmari were a nomadic people living far to the south, before they settled among the ruins of Drankor. The Dunmari worship a family pantheon, the Five Silbings, along with other minor gods and goddesses. Dunmari temples are typically pentagonal, representing the five major deities:

* Jeevali, the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family; often the major diety associated with temples that are the
center of worship in villages and small temporary settlements across Dunmar.
* Laka, the god of knowledge, agriculture, and the seasons; often associated with centers of learning.
* Aagir, the god of war, fire, and death; protector of soldiers 
* Sonkar, the goddess of beauty, truth, artisans, and justice;
* Chidya, the goddess of nature, the land, animals, and weather; worshiped especially by herders and shepherds and those who live a nomadic life

### Non-Human Religions
While many non-humans have their own gods and religions, of particular note are the Elder races, whose deities, the Firstborn hold a special place in Taelgar mythology. These are:

* Aldanor (the living tree) and Elmerca (the wild star) of the
elves
* Entamba, the mountain god of the Stoneborn
* the Tharzen Anzinakoa, the spirit gods of the Lizardfolk
* the seven Bahrâzel, founding creators of the dwarves
* the First Ones, the gods of the halflings.

Little is known of the worship practices of the elder races.
