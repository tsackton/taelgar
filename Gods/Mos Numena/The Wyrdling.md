### The Wyrdling
*they/them*

The Wyrdling is rarely depicted in human form, and is depicted in many ways. The most common are chaotic and natural in nature: an embodied storm, a whirlpool, sometimes a rainbow. But some depictions show the Wyrdling as a jester with two faces, one male and one female, happy and sad at the same time. They are the Divine of chaos, luck, chance, and fate, and are associated with prophecy, divination, dreams, and the virtue of hope. They watch over those taking risks or chances, as well as artists and poets, and those who are lost in their own minds.
